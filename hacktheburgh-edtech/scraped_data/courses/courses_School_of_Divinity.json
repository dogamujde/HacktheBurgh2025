    "summary": "This course strengthens students' biblical Hebrew language skills at an intermediate level. It offers a structured consolidation of grammar and vocabulary, and focusses on using the language to translate, analyse, and explore texts from the Hebrew Bible.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course builds on the biblical Hebrew language skills acquired in 'Introducing Biblical Hebrew' (or equivalent course), strengthening them at an intermediate level. It is intended to consolidate and develop students' grammar and vocabulary proficiency, and to put these skills to use. It achieves this through close analysis of texts from the Hebrew Bible. Students read, translate, and explore various set texts, considering their textual, historical, and literary dimensions.Syllabus/outline contentThe precise content of the course varies from year to year. It always includes a review of grammar and close reading of several set texts, of varied character and difficulty. These texts will primarily be prose narratives, such as the creation accounts (Gen 1-3); the book of Jonah; the book of Ruth; or the prose framework of Job (Job 1-2, 42). Poetry may also be introduced towards the end of the course, such as a selection of Psalms, or excerpts from the prophets. The set texts will be read, translated, and analysed in depth.Student Learning ExperienceStudents have three hours of class time per week. In advance of most classes, they will be expected to read, translate, and analyse a short portion of the set text. In class, students will discuss their translations and consolidate any grammatical issues that emerge. They will use their language skills for exegetical purposes, and explore together what new light the original language might shed on our interpretation of the text. In-class assessment provides students a useful way to track their progress, and an essay gives them further opportunity to practice their language skills.",

It will show how there are a variety of Buddhist practices and that its core ideas can produce a diversity of ethical and practical outcomes in Buddhist and non-Buddhist societies. It will provide an historical overview of the origins and development of Buddhism in India and its spread through Asia. It will suggest that it is often simplistic to portray Buddhism as apolitical, removed from society, and in line with modern science. The course will tackle the Buddhist understanding of violence, race, gender, and sexuality. It will show how Buddhism has a complex history, with its ideas anticipating both ethically sound and more controversial involvement in Buddhist societies and culture.Outline Content:The course will begin with an introduction to the topics to be studied, and the nature of our analysis of Buddhism over the coming weeks. There will be a focus on challenging preconceived ideas about Buddhism. Buddhism will be studied as diverse, engaged in society, political, and sometimes controversial. The course will then explain Buddhism in ancient India. It will analyse how Buddhism emerged from its wider Indian religious and philosophical setting. There will be a focus on understanding the Indian and wider Asian context of Buddhist ideas and practices. There will next be a study and interpretation of the ways in which Buddhist ideas and practices became distinctive including an analysis of Buddhist ethics, Buddhist meditation, and Buddhist philosophy. Finally the course will show how Buddhism emerged in modern societies including encounters with colonialism, the commercial appropriation of Buddhism, and its relevance to discourses related to politics, violence, race, gender, and the eco-crises.Student Learning Experience:This blended learning course will be delivered through short lectures, group discussions, exercises and activities, and readings which will be set in advance of each weekly session. Students will be expected to come to each class having read the weekly reading and prepared any materials or exercises that have been set.

The selection of global contexts may differ each time the course is delivered, but the course will usually include a section on Ancient India, the birthplace of Buddhism. Other sections could address any of the other global contexts in which Buddhism is found, including various parts of Asia, and the 'west'. Each global context will be explored using a range of sources, including texts (in translation), visual and material culture, and ethnographic accounts of lived religious practice. Through taking this course you will discover some of the fascinating varieties of Buddhism across time and place.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course is broadly divided into three sections of three weeks each, with an introductory week and a concluding week. Each of the three sections explores a particular global context in detail, and will often be led by a different lecturer. For example, there may be three weeks on the emergence of Buddhism in ancient India, and how it related to its cultural and religious background. Another three weeks might explore modern Thai Buddhism, and the ways in which Buddhist institutions and practices are tied up in wider society and politics. Another three weeks might explore the place of Buddhism in British society. The specific contexts may change depending on staff availability and interests, and you should check with the CO if you want further information about what is planned for the year you are taking the course.Student Learning Experience Information:The contact hours for the course comprise three lectures and one small group tutorial. Lectures will be led by experts in Buddhist Studies, and will include interactive content. Tutorials will be student-led discussions of set readings or primary source materials. Students will demonstrate their achievement of the learning outcomes through participation in class activities, a short reflection on a tutorial reading, a mid-semester coursework essay (addressing the first section of the course), and an examination scheduled at the end of the semester. Feedback will be offered on tutorial work and an essay plan, as well as on the essay itself, in order to ensure students are fully supported in succeeding in the course.",

We will look at philosophical, ethical and scientific challenges to Christian theology; at the diversity of Christian theology across time and space; and at some of the key ongoing arguments that shape Christian theology. By the end of this course, you will have had the opportunity both to do theology and to reflect critically on how theology is done.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:The aim of this course is to give students a critical understanding of the diverse methods, sources and norms of Christian theology; of ongoing challenges to, and debates about, the project of Christian theology; and of contemporary trends and issues in Christian theology. The primary focus will be on recent and contemporary theology, but the course will also draw on historical examples, to equip students to understand how approaches to theology have varied across time and space and to enable critical reflection on the nature and authority of tradition.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course is divided into two broad sections, and indicative questions and topics for each section are as follows. METHODS, SOURCES AND NORMS: Who does Christian theology? What's the relationship between Christian theology and Christian practice? How should the Bible be used and interpreted? What is 'tradition' and why does it matter? Does better theology make the world a better place, and if not what is the point? CHALLENGES FOR THEOLOGY:  How can people speak about God if God is unknowable? What is the relationship between Christian theology and the sciences? How big a problem is the problem of evil? Is Christian theology inherently patriarchal? How should Christian theology relate to Jewish thought, or Muslim thought?Student Learning Experience Information:The course will be taught through three one-hour classes and one one-hour tutorial per week. There is a schedule of readings which the students will be required to read before relevant lectures and tutorials. Through participation in lecture and tutorial discussions, as well as through tutorial exercises, an essay, and an exam, students will demonstrate their achievement of the learning outcomes. Tutorial readings and key texts are available in digital format via resourcelists.ed.ac.uk.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This is a foundational course in Christian theology that explores the importance of doctrine in the Christian faith, both historically and in its present day expressions. Students cover five key areas of doctrine (the Trinity, theological anthropology, Christology, Pneumatology, and ecclesiology), each of which is taught in relation to the Christian Scriptures, subsequent contextualised in its development throughout the history of Christianity, and challenged in relation to possible contemporary articulations of the doctrines in question. The goal of the course is that students will be introduced to systematic, historical and constructive approaches to Christian theology.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course has five units, each of which is covered in a two-week block: (i) The Trinity, (ii) Theological Anthropology, (iii) Christology, (iv) Pneumatology, and (v) Ecclesiology.Each unit covers the development of the topic concerned in five parts: (i) in the Christian Scriptures, (ii) in the early church, (iii) in the Medieval era, (iv) in the Reformation era, and (v) in contemporary theology.Student Learning Experience Information:The course is taught through a mixture of lectures and tutorials. There are three lectures and one tutorial per week. There are two tutorial readings per unit: one 'classic' and one 'modern'. Students are taught how to handle historic and contemporary theological texts comparatively, and with sensitivity to historical context.

    "course_description": "Academic Description:An examination of the development, self-understanding and self-definition of Christianity in the period between the New Testament and the advent of Constantine, in the setting of the religiously pluralistic society of the Roman Empire. The aim of the course is to give students a general understanding of the development of early Christianity before Constantine, and of its intellectual, cultural, and religious context in the Roman empire of the second and third centuries, and familiarity with a representative range of original sources from the early Christian world, both literary and visual.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course will look at ways in which Christianity was defined over against Judaism and paganism; at Christian engagement with Graeco-Roman education and philosophy; at the development of the ideology of martyrdom; at sociological questions, including the role of women, slaves and commerce in the growth of Christianity; at the construction of orthodoxy and heresy; and at non-literary evidence of Christianity in this period.Student Learning Experience Information:This course offers students an in-depth, thematic study of Christianity over a relatively short period of two centuries, allowing them to pursue particular questions in greater depth than is possible in a survey course. It includes elements of history, Classics, philosophy, theology and sociology, allowing students to specialize in the areas of most interest to them while still gaining a broad knowledge of Christianity in the period. It allows students unfamiliar with the period an encounter with a thought-world of a place and time far removed from our own, and allows those familiar with it to engage with its cultural questions from new angles. Students are expected to attend two lectures and a tutorial each week, and to participate in tutorials both by posting up comments on the weekly text in advance of the tutorial, and by contributing to the tutorial discussion. Students are encouraged to read widely in order to make the most of the course.",

The course provides a valuable preparation for ethics courses at level 10.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course opens with a survey of five possible sources of ethics: tradition, nature, scripture, reason and relationships. The following weeks focus on particular ethical methods and concepts that have emerged from these: virtue, command, conscience, utility, freedom, community, narrative and purpose. Throughout the course, there will be the opportunity to consider and debate current ethical issues using these sources, methods and concepts. Guidance will also be offered to improve learning, study skills and performance in assessed work.Student Learning Experience Information:In weeks 1-5 there are three 50-minute lectures and a small group tutorial. In weeks 6-11 there are two 50-minute lectures and optional active learning sessions immediately following one or both of these lectures. Major ideas are explored by means of key texts, which students read in their own personal study time. In the lectures an audience voting system is used to check understanding and gain responses to ethical questions. There is the opportunity to ask questions and debate ethical issues in small groups, in which each student gives a presentation.

Drawing on case studies from many indigenous and non-indigenous contexts, the course seeks to understand both the experience of those who we label as practising 'indigenous religions' and their relationship to the larger community in both national and international contexts.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:The aim of the course is to examine various themes, theories, and methodologies in the study of indigenous religions, both as a 'local' and 'global' experience. It will engage with historical and contemporary ideas and practices, without losing sight of the complex geo-political landscapes that indigenous peoples find themselves in. The course will highlight key questions related to religious practice, belief, myths, healing, stories, knowledge, performance, nationalism, and transnationalism and the way these ideas are navigated across time and space. It will also bring these ideas to bear on the academic study of 'indigenous religions', and critically assess its engagement with the hegemonic model of 'world religions'.Outline Content:The lectures are organised into two sections, one focusing on African traditions and the other on their manifestation in the diaspora. The first section will examine the themes, theories and methodologies in the study of indigenous religions in Africa. It provides three case studies from the global south. It concludes by examining the impact of African indigenous religions on contemporary civil society and other religions. The second half charts a trajectory of religiosity as it is articulated in the African diaspora pulling from several different traditions such as Palo, Obeah and Ifa (among others) and look at several different nation-states such as the United States, Cuba, and Brazil.Student Learning Experience Information:The course has a 3-hour lecture plus a 1-hour tutorial per week. Lectures are based around presentations from the lecturer and include some audio-visual content. Background readings are set for each week's topics. Tutorials are student-led discussions of set readings based on a full bibliography built into the syllabus, and involving student presentations.Students will demonstrate their completion of the intended learning outcomes through a combination of lecture and tutorial activities, by the tutorial assessments, a main essay, and by completion of an exam. The main essay will require attention to points and themes crossing two or more weeks, and the exam will require 3 questions to be answered from three sections covering the entire course (based on traditions, themes and methodologies), with the aim to achieve a whole course coverage in assessment.",

Tutorials will concentrate on looking in depth at original texts from the periods studied.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course is divided into three sections: Christianity in the Roman imperial period (before and after Constantine), Christianity in the Byzantine East and Eastern Europe, and Christianity in medieval Western Europe. In each period, we will look both at crisis events (e.g. the great theological controversies of Nicaea and Chalcedon, the Iconoclastic controversy, the Crusades from both Eastern and Western perspectives) and emerging cultural themes (e.g. Christian appropriation of classical culture; Christian dialogue with Islam).Student Learning Experience Information:The course has a programme of self-paced audio/visual material each week equivalent to three one-hour lectures. Weekly tutorials will be held. As well as the primary text for each tutorial, there is a schedule of secondary reading. Each student will be required to write one main blog entry online on a primary text and give a presentation based on it to the relevant tutorial. Every student will also be expected to write weekly short comments on the blogs and participate in tutorial discussion each week.In additional to the tutorial work, students will also investigate two topics in depth through pieces of written coursework, each supported by a preparatory workshop run by a lecturer.

It covers mission and ministry in Africa, Latin America, Asia and North America, as well as following changes in Europe and movements of religious transformation, cultural encounter and missionary expansion.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course applies historical approaches and the study of original texts to the understanding of formative trends in Christian history throughout the world from the sixteenth century to the present day. In European history attention is paid to the sixteenth-century Reformations (with particular reference to Scotland), the impact on the churches of the Enlightenment and industrialisation, and their response in the twentieth century to totalitarian regimes in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. On the global stage, the course covers the expansion of European Christendom to Latin America, Asia and Africa, the role of Christianity in shaping American history, and the more recent growth of distinctive varieties of non-western Christianity. In tutorials these themes are illustrated by study of original texts.Student Learning Experience Information:The course has three lectures and one tutorial each week. As well as the primary text for each tutorial, there is a schedule of secondary reading. Each student will be required to write one main blog entry online on a primary text and give a presentation based on it to the relevant tutorial. Every student will also be expected to write weekly short comments on the blogs and participate in tutorial discussion each week.In additional to the tutorial work, students will also investigate two topics in depth through pieces of written coursework, each supported by a preparatory workshop run by a lecturer. The workshop sessions will be either in person or online and spread throughout the semester.",

Currently, however, only a handful of institutions in the world offer training in this subject. This course (open to levels 8-11) will provide students with a foundational introduction to Syriac as language and field.",
    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionThis course introduces students to Classical Syriac - the language of one of the most ancient traditions of Christianity. The course is accessible to absolute beginners and assumes no prior knowledge. Students begin by learning the alphabet and writing system, followed by a systematic study of grammar, syntax, and will acquire new vocabulary each week. Learning will be consolidated through short translation exercises and vocab quizzes. By the end of the course, students will be able to read simple Syriac prose, and conduct a detailed final exam of a set text taken from a 4th-century homily.Outline ContentThe course begins with an introduction to the alphabet, vocalic system, and pronunciation followed by a systematic overview of grammar. Elements of grammar will include: nouns (emphatic, absolute, construct); active and passive participles; strong and weak verbs (forms I-VI). This is supplemented by incremental vocabulary acquisition and frequent translation exercises from various textbooks. The course ends with an examination of a short extract of a homily by Ephrem of Syria (d. 373). Students will be required to analyse and parse out the grammatical, syntactic, and theological features of this text.Student Learning ExperienceThe course meets four times a week. The course tutor will explain new grammar, but students are encouraged to ask questions and actively engage with the course material. This includes students being required to not only read and translate sentences in Syriac but to also analyse and parse out their grammar. There is an expectation that students will come prepared for lessons and go over each class in their own time, memorising vocabulary, verb forms, and other aspects of the language. There will also be an audio-visual component of the teaching, namely video and tape recordings of Syriac recitation in liturgical settings by members of the community. This will provide students with a sense of the language as a living tradition. Students will demonstrate their achievements through class tests and a final exam.",

Several weeks will be spent looking at Mark's Gospel, followed by a quicker look at Matthew, Luke and John.

Background reading is listed for each lecture, and specific tutorial tasks are assigned for each week. In addition, students will be put into small groups to work on one 'artefact' from the time of Jesus, which they will present to the rest of the class in week 11.

Students will engage with contemporary issues important to both Jews and Muslims through the study of Jewish and Islamic history, religion and cultures in various location across the globe. Various methods of study are introduced alongside in-depth engagement with key religious concepts and historical events.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:The course provides an introduction to the study of Jews and Muslims from the beginning of the formation of what we today call Judaism and Islam, outlining historical developments and paying attention to contemporary diversity.The weeks exploring Judaism address varieties of Jewish lived realities across the globe at different times. Here, the study of religion is introduced through a focus on case studies of Jewish culture and religion in specific contexts, paired with reflection on how to study these. Each case study gives rise to the consideration of methodological questions. Religious studies approaches will be presented alongside anthropological, historical, cultural and textual ways of interpreting the evidence gathered from the case studies.These section on Islam provide an introduction to the religion of Islam from the moment of its inception through its evolution into the modern period. Through the study of the artefacts of Islamic civilization (including its scriptures, literature, art and philosophy) the course will expose students to the diversity of Islam across various historical and spatial contexts and the variety of ways in which individuals and societies expressed their understandings of Islam and their relationship to it.Syllabus/Outline Content:The lectures are organised into three sections, one on Jews and Judaism, one on Islam and Muslims, and finally, one on inter-religious encounters. Proceeding from an engagement with early Jewish history and the formation of key texts, the course turns to a consideration of Jewish history. Via an engagement with developments of Jewish culture through case studies across the past two millennia, the focus of the lectures are Jewish experiences of and within modernity, the development of religious divisions, changing relationships of Jews to non-Jewish society and the place of Jews in society, and antisemitism. We conclude with major developments of the twentieth century, such as mass migration, genocide, and national self-determination in the State of Israel alongside life in diaspora.The aim of the section on Islam will be to allow students to evaluate and assess the validity of claims (by Muslims and non-Muslims, experts and non-experts), about what 'Islam' has to say about politics, violence, human rights, freedom of expression, the rights of minorities, etc. by taking into account the normativity and diversity of Islam and by pointing to individuals, movements and intellectual currents within the Islamic tradition as exemplars of the same. Finally, by locating the study of Islam within the overall study of world history and the study of religion, students will be able to articulate the ways in which the study of Islam shapes their understanding of 'religion' and its relationship to other spheres of human activity.The course concludes with a section on encounters of Jews and Muslims with Christianity and with each other, historically and today, in the region of origin of both religious traditions, and in different places across the globe.Student Learning Experience Information:The course consists of a weekly suite of lectures and a tutorial. The three weekly lectures give students the opportunity to gain an initial overview of a wealth of material. Lectures will provide subject specific knowledge about the religious traditions and introduce students to the methods for studying Jewish, and Muslim religious lives and cultures. Participation in the weekly tutorial hour gives students the opportunity to debate the issues raised in lectures and apply relevant methods to carefully selected source texts and case studies. Students are expected to read specific texts for the tutorials and evidence their understanding in the tutorial assessments. In order to successfully complete the course, students are expected to engage with the materials presented in lectures by following up questions arising through the use of reference works and further reading as indicated on the course syllabus and beyond in the library. Learning outcomes are tested in researching and writing a course essay for which guidance will be given, and in a final exam.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:The course will examine key aspects of popular religious culture during the early modern period in Europe which witnessed the transformation of religious life associated with the Protestant and Catholic Reformations. It will deal specifically with religious ideas and devotional practices at a popular level and the changes introduced by both Protestant and Catholic reformers. As part of the spectrum of belief it will examine ideas concerning magic and witchcraft and it will include a study of the witch hunting which swept through Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Throughout the course particular attention will be given to the role of women in churches and society and how they were affected by the religious upheavals of the period. As this course is concerned with a largely non-literate culture it will make extensive use of visual evidence.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course will apply historical approaches to popular culture and belief with a strong emphasis on skills for assessing historical evidence. Themes studied will include: what ordinary people may have believed before and after the Protestant and Catholic reformations; the religious roles open to women; the beliefs of Early Modern people about healing and magic; and the explanations that have been offered for early modern witch hunting. Students will become familiar with the work of key historians in the field and also engage with visual sources each week through the use of primary material accessed via digital collections.Student Learning Experience Information:The course has two lectures and one tutorial each week. Each week is structured to follow the same pattern of learning, research and discussion. Lectures will introduce themes at the beginning of each week and will also be recorded. Mid-week students will be reading for their tutorial and also posting on Learn for 'Image of the Week'. The week will conclude with a tutorial group.In 'Image of the Week' students will be reviewing a collection of images (visual primary sources). They will each choose one image and assess the ways in which that source reflects the themes of the week. They will then write a short post on Learn arguing why their choice merits the title 'Image of the Week'. Tutorial groups will debate the issues emerging from these posts each week. Students will also be responsible for leading the discussion of the set reading for their tutorial group for one week in the semester and for participating in all discussions.During the semester the Compare and Review task will allow students to delve more deeply into an area by asking them to contrast and evaluate two short readings on a topic. Students will demonstrate achievement of the learning outcomes through the assessed weekly posts on Learn, a Compare and Review task (1000 words) and a final exam (2 hours).",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course is one of a suite of four courses which introduce students to the academic study of the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible (HB/OT) and New Testament. In this course, we explore the phenomenon of prophecy in the HB/OT and its substantial body of prophetic texts. The 'writing prophets' are set within the context of their ancient Near Eastern environment and located within the historical moments of their own activity. Selected texts are examined more closely in historical, literary, and theological perspectives. Shared themes are considered, as well as the various developments which distinguish periods of prophetic activity, and individual prophetic books.Syllabus/Outline Content:The broad context for the study of the prophets is considered by covering the nature of the biblical canon, its historical structure, and the wider ancient Near Eastern cultural context. Prophetic elements of the 'historical books' of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament (HB/OT) are investigated, before turning to the 'writing prophets', Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Book of the Twelve ('Minor Prophets'). These are studied through the main phases of prophetic activity in the Assyrian, Babylonian, and Persian periods. The course concludes with the rise of apocalyptic prophecy in the book of Daniel, and its trajectory into later Jewish and Christian texts.Student Learning Experience Information:Each week, students will engage in a variety of activities that they can complete in their own time. These activities may include, for example, watching short videos, reading biblical texts / secondary literature, posting on discussion boards, and testing their knowledge through short quizzes. All of these will be available through the virtual learning environment (Learn). In addition, students will participate in one weekly tutorial (in-person or online), in which they will discuss a particular biblical text and a key issue arising from it. During the course, students will write three short blogs based on the tutorials, and one essay analysing a biblical text. Through these, as well as the examination at the conclusion of the course, students will demonstrate their achievement of the learning outcomes.",

It begins by evaluating the problem of defining 'religion' and exploring how Religious Studies has renewed its focus on the role of religion in everyday life: in \"lived\" beliefs and practices. Literature from key texts in Religious studies will be considered alongside international case studies, including material from Europe and South Asia.Student Learning Experience Information:The meetings will be interactive and will allow students to engage with the topic through lecture/video and tutorial discussions. Each student will do a presentation based on the assigned reading and will be responsible for leading class discussion during the tutorial hour. Through their participation in lectures, tutorials, written work, final examination, and feedback offered, students will demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes.",

The course introduces one thinker each week. Students explore the context, examine the concepts, and engage with the consequences of the thinker's approach to God within the framework of her or his philosophy. The course concentrates on primary rather than secondary texts in order to enable students to identify and interpret the arguments of classic and contemporary philosophical texts carefully and critically.Student Learning Experience:The course is taught through three one-hour lectures plus one one-hour tutorial each week. The lectures introduce students to the context, the concepts, and the consequences of the philosophy of the thinker whose text is discussed in the tutorial. Students prepare the tutorial texts in their study time prior to the tutorial. The tutorials are dedicated to the discussion of the texts that are set for each week. The course also covers study skills, particularly essay writing.

    "course_description": "Academic Description:'The Hebrew Bible is sometimes understood as the source of a 'traditional' Judaeo-Christian approach to marriage and sexual practice. A comprehensive examination reveals, however, that biblical assumptions about sex, gender, and kinship are complex and internally diverse. Some of these assumptions stand in tension with traditional Jewish and Christian norms for marriage and sexual activity.' (Ken Stone).The seminar wants to give an introduction into these diverse assumptions around sex and gender by engaging with the biblical texts and selected secondary literature. It discusses matters such as the creation of man and woman, the connection of sexuality and male struggles for power and honour, laws about sexuality in the Pentateuch, and the use of the marriage metaphor for the relationship between Yhwh and Israel. Due to the topic of the course, there will be some sexually explicit materials and the seminars will deal with several adult themes.  Due to the sensitive materials, the lecture will not be recorded, but slides will be available on LEARN.Sample Syllabus/Outline Content:Week 1: Course Introduction and Course Hermeneutics: Sex and Gender - Same or Different?Week 2: The Creation of Man and Woman: Gen 1-3Week 3: Sex and Violence I: Gen 19 and Judg 19Week 4: Sex and Violence II: Gen 34 and 2 Sam 13Week 5: Forbidden Sex: Lev 18Week 6: David and Jonathan (1 Sam 19:1-8): A Model for Same-Sex Love?Week 7: King David and Bathsheba (2 Sam 11): Me Too in Jerusalem?Week 8: The Prophetic Marriage Metaphor I: The Prophet and the Whore (Hos 1-3)Week 9: The Prophetic Marriage Metaphor I: Porno-Prophecy in Ezek 16 and 23Week 10: Love Poetry: Song of SongsWeek 11: Course Summary and RevisionStudent Learning Experience Information:The class is taught using the 'flipped classroom' approach. In each week, the first half of the session is a seminar discussion of the week's topic, while the second half of the seminar is a lecture that introduces the biblical texts for the coming week.  The engagement with the biblical texts combines literary readings with a solid historical-critical approach, aiming to understand the texts as documents from their own times. Students are expected to prepare the biblical texts and secondary readings for discussion, where they may be asked to engage in learning activities, discussions and partner-work, reflect on a piece of art, or discuss the implications of the biblical texts for today's society. The preparation comprises 1-2 biblical texts and approximately 60 pages of readings per seminar session.Students are assessed on a coursework essay and an exam, through which they will demonstrate the achievement of the learning outcomes. There will be written feedback on the essay plan, which enables the students to write their essay with confidence.",

    "course_description": "Academic descriptionThis course examines the wisdom literature of the Hebrew Bible in its ancient West Asian context. It taps into the wisdom of the ages to explore issues which perennially face humankind. Scholarship in this area has flourished recently, as old assumptions are questioned and new issues brought into focus. Does the book of Proverbs suppose that good deeds always have good consequences? Does the book of Job offer a viable solution to the problem of innocent suffering? Does the book of Ecclesiastes find any meaning in life? And can modern perspectives shed any new light on these ancient texts and problems?Syllable/outline contentA typical course outline might run as follows: After an introduction to wisdom literature, the course examines the major biblical wisdom books, each contextualised amongst other ancient literature. First, it explores the book of Proverbs, with its apparent act-consequence connection and divinely run world order.  Using a feminist hermeneutic, it examines Proverbs polarised depictions of 'Lady Wisdom' and 'Lady Folly'  Next, it probes into the problem of innocent suffering in the book of Job, along with related questions about the character of God and motives for human piety. It uses disability studies to examine Job's physical body, and ecological hermeneutics to explore depictions of the nonhuman world. Finally, it examines the book of Ecclesiastes, which ruminates on the meaninglessness of life, and yet the ongoing possibility of pleasure. Ecclesiastes emphasises human frailty and ignorance in the grand sweep of cosmic time, while critiquing the unjust accumulation of wealth.Student learning experience informationStudents are taught in weekly 2-hour seminars. The teaching staff provide some lecture content (either pre-recorded or in class), and most of the class time is devoted to interactive activities. Students may, for example, have a debate, lead a discussion, analyse a text, reflect on a piece of art, discuss with a partner. Students complete a midsemester essay related to issues covered early in the course to try out their ideas. They compile an annotated bibliography to better understand the scholarly field, which will then serve as a helpful resource for the final essay.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:The New Testament Book of Revelation has exerted an exceptional theological and cultural influence. The proposed course will provide students with the chance to study this important text in its historical context, but also to explore its later reception in theology, art, politics and film. The course will begin with a close reading of the text, locating it within its ancient Jewish and Roman imperial context, and drawing on ancient literary and archaeological evidence to explore questions of genre, identity, and response to colonialism. Recent scholarship, including historical-critical, postcolonial, rhetorical, and feminist interpretations, will enable us to engage critically with a variety of approaches to the text. We will then draw on reception studies to explore some of the many ways Revelation has been interpreted in later theology, politics, and culture.Outline Content:The course will begin by locating Revelation in its ancient historical and literary context, emphasising the significance of the Jewish experience under Roman imperialism, the Jewish War with Rome, and the destruction of the Jerusalem temple, as well as the diverse nature of Jesus-following groups in the first century and their relationships with (other) Jews. We will address questions of genre and rhetoric, considering different approaches to reading and interpreting this enigmatic text. Our study will include close readings of particular passages, employing historical-critical, postcolonial, feminist and other hermeneutical approaches. In the last weeks of the class, we will examine some selected examples of the reception of revelation in later culture, theology and art and reflect on what these interpretations can tell us about the text and its ongoing influence.Student Learning Experience:There will be a 2-hour seminar each week, which will include interactive lectures, discussion, and small group activities. Each student will write one blog post during the course of the semester. There will be a mid-semester essay and a final exam.",

This course will socially and historically contextualize a variety of positions in interaction with established academic theories of religion, providing a theoretically and methodologically rich critical introduction to a variety of controversial 'religion-related' ideologies, arguments, groups, movements and identifications.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:The aim of the course is to introduce students to a range of 'religion-related' formations - atheistic, humanistic, 'non-religious' - in modern societies, in a historical and sociological context. The focus is to examine formations which (positively) propagate 'post-religious' identities and also which (negatively) resist 'religion'. It will also examine the various theoretical and methodological issues involved in the study of atheism, humanism, non-religion and related categories, and consider these formations in relation to the broader academic study of religion/s.Syllabus and Outline Content:We begin with an overview of the course and a discussion of the state of play in the contemporary study of 'atheism', 'humanism', 'non-religion' and related formations, and discuss the grounds of their inclusion within the comparative study of religion/s. We will then trace the etymology of 'Atheism' through the pejorative ancient Greek 'atheos' to the political assignment of the Latin 'atheismus' to the beliefs and practices of the early Christians. We continue this historical progression through the periods of the Renaissance, Reformation and Enlightenment, looking at the content, context and some key exponents of major scientific and social critiques of 'religion' in the West, up to the 'New Atheism' of the early twenty-first century. Our attention then turns to non-Western contexts, paying particular attention to the Marxist-Leninist scientific atheism of the former-USSR and to post-colonial rationalist skepticism in India. Finally, we fully embrace a more sociological and ethnographic approach and look at contemporary 'humanist' and 'non-religious' formations, the problematic entanglements of this whole field with issues of gender, race and ethnicity, and the genesis, conceptualizations and uses of the notion of 'religious indifference'.Student Learning Experience Information:The course has a one hour lecture plus a one hour seminar per week. Lectures are based around presentations from the lecturer and include some audio-visual content. Background readings are set for each week's topics. Seminars are student-led discussions of set readings based on a full bibliography built into the syllabus, and involving student presentations.Students will demonstrate their completion of the intended learning outcomes through a combination of lecture and seminar activities, by the preparation of a presentation, a guided essay and a main essay, and by completion of an exam. The main essay will require attention to points and themes crossing two or more weeks, and the exam will require one question to be answered from three sections covering the entire course, with the aim to achieve a whole course coverage in assessment.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:The academic fields of 'the Bible' and 'Archaeology' are broad and may be highly contentious (e.g., ASOR's disavowal of Biblical Archaeology). Depending on the specific area of focus (e.g., exodus), arguments may become rather heated. Nonetheless, it is recognized that the literary narratives, poetry, laws, parables, biographical details, letters, etc embedded within the biblical texts of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament reflect some degree of reality that may be illuminated, supplemented or corrected by archaeological evidence. Archaeology, likewise, can benefit from biblical evidence to contextualise, explain and give meaning to mute artefacts. The two fields are distinct, but they are incontrovertibly related. Some of the Dead Sea Scrolls are not just biblical texts, but they are also the earliest archaeological artefacts of the emergence of authoritative scriptures.This course is conceived broadly to accommodate the many topics and methodological issues that arise and may be studied under the general rubric. Thus, for instance, a colleague whose expertise is in the Hebrew Bible may teach the course as part of the debate about the history of ancient Israel. Alternatively, another whose interest and training lie in the Graeco-Roman period could focus on the trial of Jesus in the praetorium of Pilate and his crucifixion on Golgotha.Syllabus/Outline Content:Below is a sample syllabus. The texts studied and weekly breakdown may change from year to year.1. Methodological Considerations: Bible and Archaeology2. Joshua 1-11 and the Archaeology of Iron Age I3. 2 Samuel 6-7 and the Ophel4. Jeremiah 27-28 and the Al Yahudu Tablets5. Deut 12 and Mount Gerizim6. Prologue of Jubilees and Khirbet Qumran7.

    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionMonasticism is considered crucial for the survival of Buddhism. This course aims to explore the origin, evolution, and function of Buddhist monasticism. Throughout the course, we will collectively reflect over some significant questions such as: - How monasticism is defined in different Buddhist traditions. Why people willingly choose monastic life that involves significant changes in clothing, eating habits, daily routine, etc. while strictly following vows, rules and precepts. How Buddhist monasticism has transformed over the long span of Buddhist history, and what circumstances led to these changes. How the Buddhist monastic institution interacts or negotiates its relationship with political powers and other historical and social processes. How the institution of Buddhist nuns or female monastics continue in China while disappearing in other parts of Asia. What we can learn from the regiment of monastic life and the literary and artistic creations of Buddhist monks and nuns about how to live our life.We will be discussing how a disciplined life and living in a community can enable ethical transformations. Although some of the earliest Buddhist texts advocated strict celibacy, most of the Buddhist communities in subsequent centuries adopted a form of monasticism and priesthood that allowed for families. We will explore the social changes, ethical and philosophical ideas that led to the acceptance of families in Buddhist monasticism. Additionally, we will examine how monasticism, with or without celibacy, influences the ethical development of individuals who choose one or the other form of lifeOutline ContentThe course will begin with an exploration of the concept of 'monasticism' within the sphere of religion and religious studies. During the initial week, we will also delve into the theoretical and methodological approaches that are employed in studying, interpreting, and explaining monasticism more broadly. Subsequently, from the second week onwards, our attention will be directed towards the evolution of the Buddhist monastic establishment, commencing with its nascent formation and dissemination across various Asian countries. Each week will be devoted to investigating specific themes or geographic locations in further detail.Student Learning ExperienceEach class will consist of a lecture followed by discussion. During lecture the instructor will provide an overview of the historical context and technical concepts highlighted in the readings. The rest of the class will be devoted to in-depth discussions among students, where they can share their personal insights and perspectives on the readings. Active participation in classroom discussions is essential for maximizing the learning experience.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course explores key thinkers in, approaches to, and controversies within Christian theological ethics. The focus is on understanding and evaluating how recent and current contributions to Christian ethics draw on Christian scripture and tradition, on the experience of Christian communities, and on different academic disciplines and approaches, to address specific contemporary ethical challenges. Topics to be covered may include the climate crisis; poverty and economic inequality; truth and lies in an age of fake news; misogyny and gender-based violence; and the treatment of non-human animals. Alongside these topics, we will explore fundamental questions about the project of Christian ethics. Why and on what basis can we talk about a distinctive 'Christian ethics'? What methods and sources are appropriate for Christian ethics? And what should be the response when Christian theology itself stands accused of being 'unethical'?Syllabus/Outline Content:The first, shorter, part of the course will focus on approaches to Christian ethics - what ethics is, how it relates to Christian theology, whether and why it makes sense to talk about a distinctively Christian ethics, and how Christian communities arrive at ethical positions. The second part will apply and develop these ideas through in-depth consideration of Christian approaches to contemporary ethical challenges. Topics to be considered may include, but are not limited to: the climate crisis; poverty and economic inequality; truth, lies and 'fake news'; treatment of non-human animals; misogyny and gender-based violence; ethics in finance.Student Learning Experience Information:The course is taught through the following: private study of set texts and secondary reading; lectures introducing texts and topics; interactive seminars for discussion of texts and topics, requiring specified advance preparation; use of online discussion boards; essay writing on set texts and themes arising from them.Online discussion boards will serve as a starting point for discussion in the seminars. There is no formal assessment of presentation or oral skills but nonetheless these skills are developed through facilitating and engagement in debate in the seminars.The mid-semester assessment (2000 words, 40%) will take the form of a critical review of two or more treatments of a contemporary issue in Christian theological ethics; suggested topics and readings will be provided, although alternatives may be chosen with the agreement of the course organiser. For the final essay (3000 words, 60%) students will have a choice of broad essay questions within which they will develop their own focused investigation in consultation with the course organiser.

It pays attention to the interaction of European and indigenous traditions through a series of case studies of conversion and religious innovation. It raises issues which remain of crucial relevance today, such as the connections between religious change and structures of political and economic power, or the two-way relationship between religious and ethnic identity.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:The course explores how far the growth of Christianity in modern Africa is explicable in terms of the colonial impact. Until the 1960s most scholars had no doubt that it was: the role of mission education in attracting Africans to the white man's religion was undeniable. Since decolonisation, however, the rate of expansion of Christianity has accelerated, putting in question monolithic explanations of the relationship between colonialism and African conversion. This course aims to get beyond the rhetoric, whether colonial or postcolonial, and, on the basis of intensive examination of primary texts, encourages students to form their own judgments about the parts played by African Christians and European missionaries in the story of African Christianity since 1800.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course begins with the largely negative view of Africa taken at the World Missionary Conference in 1910. It then explores the ways in which both missionaries and leading African Christians in the 19th century approached the complex relationship between 'Christianity, commerce, and civilization'. Particular attention is given to Christian competition with Islam, the impact of colonial rivalries on Christianity in Uganda, the emergence of prophet movements and independent churches, the Christian contribution to nationalism and decolonisation, the problematic role played by the churches in Rwanda, and explanations of the growth of Pentecostalism.Student Learning Experience Information:The course comprises 2 hours of contact time, a lecture and a seminar.

    "summary": "This course examines the historical and contemporary relationship between Christian movements and politics in Latin America. Special attention is given to the political implications of religious revivals, the changing forms of church-state relations, the forms of Christian activism that emerged in the continent, and the construction of civil society since 1800.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:The politicisation of religion in Latin America has attracted a good deal of scholarly and public attention in recent decades. At least since the 1970s the evangelical eruption into state politics and the activism of progressive Catholics have demonstrated the public vigour of movements of religious renewal. The projection of religious energies in the continent's public sphere, however, has longer historical roots, and it is the goal of this course to examine the dynamic relationship between Christianity and politics in Latin America over the past two centuries. Students will evaluate the political significance of religious practices and mobilisations and how Christian actors and organisations navigated turbulent processes of socio-political change. The course considers the shifting involvements between churches and the state, their role in the construction of civil society, the Christian forms of grassroots activism, and the churches' ideological discourses. Lectures and seminars will analyse the sweeping religious transformations reframing the political contours of the continent by looking at an array of case studies.Outline Content:The course will be divided in four main units: 1) The session 'Catholics and Protestants in the Emerging Nation States' concentrates on the transformations experienced by the Catholic Church under the new independent nations, especially the rise of Romanised Catholicism, and the earliest wave of evangelical expansion between 1800-1930. Case studies will be taken from Guatemala, Brazil, and Chile. 2) The next unit on 'Religious Conflict and Rebellion' examines church-state conflicts and grassroots messianic movements in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Case studies: the Canudos War in Brazil (1895-8) and the Cristero Rebellion in Mexico (1926-9). 3) The session 'Christian Political Thought and Action Before Liberation Theology' explores the local embodiments of the transnational movement Catholic Action and the implications of Protestant ecumenism in Peru, Mexico, and Brazil. 4) The final block on 'Authoritarian Rule and Democracy Since 1960' turns to contemporary issues, examining the ambiguous relationship of the Catholic Church with the repressive military regimes of the southern cone and evangelical politics.Student Learning Experience:Each weekly session will start with a one-hour lecture followed by a student presentation and a seminar discussion. There will be a list of essential and recommended readings for each week and students are expected to read the texts before lectures, so they can take part in the seminar discussions. Readings set for each week will combine primary historical sources and specialised secondary literature. In the mid-semester assessment students will write a 1000-word review of 3-4 book chapters or articles on a topic chosen from a pre-circulated list. The final assessment will consist of a 2500-word essay on one of the topics of the course.",

In exploring this remarkable transformation of Scottish religion and belief, students will engage with major debates on the history of secularisation.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course explores Christianity, doubt and new beliefs in nineteenth-century Scotland, with a strong emphasis on skills for assessing historical evidence. This was an age of sweeping cultural and intellectual change, as industrialisation, urbanisation, imperialism, scientific discovery and political reform transformed Scottish society. How were religion and belief shaped by these dramatic developments? The course explores this question through three main themes. First, it investigates the transformation of belief and practice in Scotland\u00c2\u00bfs Christian Churches and communities. Second, it considers the Victorian \u00c2\u00bfcrisis of faith\u00c2\u00bf, exploring why minority groups came to doubt and reject Christian orthodoxy. Finally, it investigates the emergence of new beliefs, including freethought, spiritualism, theosophy, esoteric magic and proto-humanist Ethical societies. Throughout the course, students will explore a range of primary-source texts and engage with major debates on the nature of secularisation.Content Outline:The course begins with an introduction to religion and society in nineteenth-century Scotland and an overview of major scholarly debates on secularisation and the crisis of faith. We then explore how Christian beliefs and practice in Scotland were transformed amidst rapid cultural, social, intellectual and political change. Themes include the Christian response to industrialisation and urbanisation, the navigation of Christian pluralism and Protestant-Catholic relations, the Churches\u00c2\u00bf response to movements for reform (especially debates on slavery, socialism and sexuality), and new developments in theology, liturgy and devotion, including church decoration. Subsequently, we explore the Victorian crisis of faith and investigate the challenges posed to Christian orthodoxies by new developments in biblical criticism, science, and encounters with non-Christian religions at home and abroad. Finally, we investigate the rise of new minority beliefs, including freethought, spiritualism, theosophy and magical esotericism. The course concludes by considering religion and belief at the fin-de-si\u00c3\u00a8cle, giving attention to the proto-humanist \u00c2\u00bfReligion of Humanity\u00c2\u00bf and the co-existence of multiple religions and beliefs. Students will engage with influential works by contemporaries across the spectrum of belief, including ministers such as Thomas Chalmers and William Robertson Smith, the artist Phoebe Anna Traquair, freethinkers such as James Affleck and Matilda Roalfe, the socialist Robert Owen, and the agnostic Jane Hume Clapperton.Student Learning Experience:This Level 10 course comprises one two-hour seminar per week, including a lecture component with opportunity for questions and a seminar discussion. Students\u00c2\u00bf preparatory reading will facilitate seminar discussions of the course themes. Each student will be required to give a short presentation at one seminar on the text(s) for the day, which will form the basis of a blog (c. 500 words). Through participation in lectures, blogs and seminar discussions, as well as through the source analysis (1000 words) and a final essay (2500 words), students will demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes.",

    "summary": "Having adopted Christianity from Constantinople (988), Prince Volodymyr made not only a religious but also a geopolitical choice. Yet for centuries Ukraine has been a home not only to the Eastern Orthodox, but also to Catholics, Greek Catholics, and Protestants, as well as to non-Christians, primarily Jews and Muslims. The course offers a more than a thousand-year long overview of the Christian presence in Ukraine, focusing on a link between religion and politics from the introduction of Christianity in Rus\u00c2\u00bf (988) until current Russo-Ukrainian war.",
    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionThe course discusses more than a thousand-year-long history of Christianity in Ukraine, starting with the baptism of Rus\u00c2\u00bf (988) under Prince Volodymyr and continuing up to the current Russo-Ukrainian war, in which Russia makes historical claims to the medieval state of Rus\u00c2\u00bf and thus to Ukrainian territories at large.Outline ContentHaving adopted Christianity from Constantinople, Rus\u00c2\u00bf entered the Byzantine world and defined Eastern Orthodoxy as a default religious choice for the majority of Christians who lived in these territories. Yet there were plentiful links to Western Christianity, especially during the time when Ukrainian territories belonged to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The case in point is the emergence of the largest Eastern Catholic Church, known now as the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, at the Union of Brest (1596). The course also analyses differences in the imperial policies towards various Christian denominations, as they were employed in the Catholic Habsburg Empire and the Orthodox Russian Empire. The Ukrainian territories were ruled by the Habsburgs and Romanovs between the partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the late eighteenth century and the fall of both empires at the end of the First World War. Close attention is paid to the Soviet religious policy in Ukraine in relation to the Orthodox, Greek Catholics, Roman Catholics, and different Protestant groups. Finally, the course looks at the surge of different Christian denominations in the early 1990s, after Ukraine gained its independence in 1991. A significant focus is put on the role of religion in the Maidans and in the current Russo-Ukrainian war.Student Learning ExperienceThe course combines lectures and seminars. For seminar discussions, the students will be generally assigned readings from primary sources and secondary literature. Additionally, the students will be asked to deliver one oral presentation and write two essays during the semester. The tentative list of essay topics will be provided by a lecturer.",

In weeks 4-11, you will be introduced to specific issues and themes, each of which will be addressed through one or more of the different subdisciplinary approaches used on the module. The issues and themes discussed will vary with the availability of teaching staff, but the course will always include at least one week focused on Christian responses to a topic of contemporary public debate. Themes likely to be covered include: creation and creatures; how ideas of sin and redemption apply to nonhuman animals; the human-animal boundary, and what it means to understand humans as animals; animals in the wisdom tradition; extinction and nonhuman animal suffering as theological challenges; and the ethics of eating animals.Student Learning Experience Information:The course will be taught through weekly two-hour classes, for which some preparation will be required. Each class will normally include an overview of the topic, and opportunities for extended discussion of reading and other preparation.

Topics include the growth of religious pluralism, the \"Victorian Crisis of Faith\", religion and nationalism in Ireland, liberal \"Broad Church\" theology revivalism and the \"social gospel\".",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:The course explores religion, politics and society in Britain and Ireland during the height of British imperial power. There are four main themes. First, the course investigates the response of the British Churches to the rapid social changes associated with mature industrial society, the movement for women's equality, and growing democracy. Second, it considers the Victorian crisis of faith, as Christian orthodoxy was challenged by modern science, biblical scholarship and increased exposure to other world faiths. Third, it explores the weakening connection of Church and State, and the growth of religious pluralism. Finally, it assesses the role of religion in defining identities in an era of democratic nationalism, giving attention to the growth of Catholic nationalism and Protestant Unionism in Ireland.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course will apply historical approaches to the religious history of imperial Britain, with a strong emphasis on skills for assessing historical evidence. Themes to be explored include Christian approaches to the challenges of industrialisation and urbanisation; Anglican sisterhoods, deaconesses and Christian feminism; popular religion, gender and secularisation; Protestant revivalism and Roman Catholic missions; Catholic Nationalism and Protestant Unionism in Ireland; Imperial Christianity and Overseas Missions; and new religious movements (spiritualism, theosophy, esoteric magic). We will read short works by a number of religious thinkers and activists, including Charles Kingsley, Charles Darwin, Josephine Butler, Matthew Arnold, John Henry Newman, David Livingstone, and Annie Besant.Student Learning Experience Information:The course meets weekly for a two-hour session. There will be a pre-recorded contextual lecture, with a very full PowerPoint, that will be available on the course Learn in advance of the course meeting. The first part of the class meeting will be devoted to a discussion of the themes of the lecture and secondary readings for the week, with questions and comments from seminar participants, who will be encouraged to comment on or raise questions. The second part of the class meeting will consist of a discussion of a key primary text or texts. A student will provide a lead blog on one of the seminar readings each week, and introduce the discussion of that seminar reading at our seminar meeting. Students will interact outside class-time by contributing to the blog ahead of the seminar. There is also a discussion board - open 24/7 - providing an informal space to allow you to keep in touch with classmates. Through participation in the lectures and seminar discussions, as well as through the written work and the examination, students will demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes.",

This course explores the disparate religious, cultural and political trends that shaped Islamic intellectual history and will do so through a variety of disciplinary approaches towards textual studies, the study of religion and history. The course provides an insight into the way religious argumentation was carried out in the Islamic religious tradition and how different groups within this tradition conceived of the relationship between reason and revelation in a variety of ways as they sought to articulate and develop a coherent account of reality.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course surveys some of the major controversies in Islamic theology, law and politics. Through a survey of primary sources wherein Muslim authors are adopting particular positions on theological, legal and political controversies, as well as secondary sources wherein the primary readings are placed in their broader historical and cultural contexts, the course allows students to explore how and why religious controversies arose in Islam, the varieties of responses they generated amongst Muslim intellectuals affiliated with different schools of thought and the ways in which these controversies have shaped the Islamic religious tradition.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course begins by surveying intra-Muslim theological debates over the nature of God, exploring how Muslims entertained and debated different ideas about how God could be known and understood, what it might mean to claim that God speaks and whether reason and revelation yielded the same ideas about God. The second part of the course deals with intra-Muslim conflicts over Islamic law. Was Islamic law to be understood as a set of arbitrary divine commands that had to be followed or was it a set of rational obligations that could be deduced through reason, a question that in many ways was linked to the debate over whether or not God was a rational being. Finally, the third section of the course looks at intra-Muslim debates over Islamic politics, in light of the discussions on theology and law considered in the first two sections of the course, seeing how Muslims advanced a number of conflicting ideas on the nature and function of the Caliphate, the Islamic state and political violence, in the form of jihad.Student Learning Experience Information:The course is divided into 11 sessions, each of which meets for 110 minutes per week. Each session is devoted to discussions on a particular cluster of readings that focuses on a discrete religious controversy. Each session is designed to incorporate a lecture from the instructor, which will incorporate audio-visual and online content. In addition, students, whether individually or in groups, are involved in student-led discussions as well as class presentations based on the readings listed in the syllabus bibliography.Students will demonstrate their attainment of the intended learning objectives through three distinct assessments: class presentations, short one page reflection papers / short quizzes and a final essay, thereby demonstrating their basic comprehension of the reading materials, their ability to utilize this material in class presentations and discussions and to construct an evidence based argument on the topics they have studied. In addition to these summative assessments, students will receive formative feedback throughout the course through oral feedback on their contributions to class discussion, their reflection papers and their essay plans.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course looks at the major works of some of Christianity's most influential writers of both East and West in the period between the New Testament and the end of the fourth century, from a theological, historical and literary perspective. Great rhetoricians such as Tertullian and John Chrysostom will be studied, alongside two of the great early theological works on the Incarnation and the Resurrection, Irenaeus' Against the Gnostics and Athanasius' On the Incarnation, as well as Origen's famous work of speculative theology, On First Principles, Eusebius of Caesarea's accounts of the martyrdoms of the Great Persecution, Egeria's account of her pilgrimage to the Holy Land in the late fourth century, Gregory Nazianzen's Trinitarian classic the Five Theological Orations, and the Lives of the Desert Monks, which deals with the quest for holiness by the hermits of the desert of both sexes in the face of the growing political struggles within the churches of the great cities. Politics, theology, and the clash of cultures provide the backdrop.Syllabus/Outline Content:After an introductory week putting the writers in context, the course covers ten different works or groups of works, one per week: The Letters of Ignatius of Antioch, Irenaeus' Against the Gnostics, Tertullian's Apology, Origen's On First Principles, The General Persecutions in Eusebius of Caesarea's Church History (books 7-9), Athanasius' On the Incarnation, Egeria's Travels, Gregory of Nazianzus' Theological Orations, John Chrysostom's sermons on Paul's letters, and the Lives and Sayings of the Desert Fathers and Mothers.Student Learning Experience Information:Classes will consist of a lecture on the background to each author and a group discussion of the text for the week on the basis of the students' wikis, which will be posted beforehand. Although the class will cover all of the works, students will be expected to concentrate on a deeper study of three of them in particular.

Through its engagement with a variety of primary and secondary sources, the course looks at the ways in which religion was experienced by and cultivated the emotional lives of ordinary and marginalised people. It also explores the continuities, ambiguities, and discrepancies within and between early modern Christian emotional cultures.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course enables students to examine and evaluate early modern Christian attitudes towards and experiences of emotion. The course looks at the ways in which religion was experienced by and cultivated the emotional lives of ordinary and marginalised people. This is achieved through the reading and examination of primary and secondary sources from a range of different national, confessional, and gender identities. Students will be encouraged to consider these sources in relation to early modern philosophical, theological, liturgical, social, physiological, cultural, and political factors which shaped Protestant and Catholic spirituality and mysticism in the 16th and 17th Centuries. Students will also be urged to situate these perspectives into the broader history of European Reformations and the continuities, ambiguities, and discrepancies within and between early modern Christian emotional cultures.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course is structured thematically and chronologically. It begins with an introduction to the methodologies and issues in the disciplinary study of emotions in history. This is followed by an exploration of early modern understandings (philosophical/physiological) of the nature of the emotions. The course then moves to the emotional cultures of Lutheran Germany, Roman Catholicism in the Mediterranean, and Scottish Reformed Protestantism. Each of these investigations is simultaneously used to explore a particular concept crucial to early modern Christian emotionality more broadly: conversion, sanctification, and sincerity (or self-examination). The course then probes more closely emotional states intrinsic to early modern Christian spirituality: doubt and despair, assurance, mystical experiences. These discussions are also used to engage with broader themes such as mental illness, theological doctrine's perceived and real impact upon the emotions, and gender. The course then explores marginalised emotional cultures in early modern England and in the non-Western world, examining the unique experiential and political challenges these contexts presented early modern Christians. The final week revisits the themes of the course and provides an opportunity for students to discuss important topics from across the syllabus and receive feedback on their final essay plans.Student Learning Experience Information:Every week students will participate in two primary activities. The first will be a lecture on the theme of the week, with an opportunity to ask questions. The second will consist in class discussion of the set readings. Students will be allocated a week in which they present a summary of the primary text and its major themes for 5-10 minutes, before facilitating the last half hour of class discussion with support from the lecturer. Students will be graded for their presentations and leadership of class discussion on assigned weeks, and formative feedback will be provided. Students will complete two further summative assessments: a coursework essay at the midpoint of the semester, and a final essay at the end of the semester. Students will be offered an opportunity for formative feedback on their final essay plans.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This methodology course aims to investigate the manner in which fieldwork plays an important role in the study of religion. Some understanding of theoretical, ethical and practical aspects of fieldwork is essential for students engaging in research with people. Given that a focus on religion is common to all students in Divinity, and that research in this area faces some very particular issues, this course will enable undergraduate students especially but not only from Religious Studies and Practical Theology to gain the necessary competence and confidence. In order to achieve this, the course combines strong theoretical and practical discussion ranging from insider/outsider issues in the study of religion, alongside detailed classwork on participant observation, interview techniques, and writing up fieldwork notes. These debates will be carefully considered both in the lectures and the seminar discussions based on readings that are both empirically rich and theoretically innovative.Syllabus/Outline Content:The complexity and richness of the course will be illustrated through thematic considerations such as the importance of ethnographic methods, validity and reliability, the researcher as research tool. It will also look at issues surrounding religion, faith and praxis and how to approach group-based research in religion. More theoretical considerations will be examined through the insider/outsider problems in fieldwork, the geo-political dimensions of fieldwork in religion, and a practical way to conceptualise and plan a research project. It will finally consider the place the self in fieldwork and the wider colonial genealogies of (ethnographic) fieldwork in/of religion.Student Learning Experience Information:The course has a programme of two-hour weekly meetings consisting sometimes of one-hour weekly lectures, and one-hour seminar discussions. Because this is also a practical course that will involve individual and group work to design, implement and also do fieldwork, some of the sessions will not follow the traditional lecture-seminar model. The meetings will be interactive and will allow students to engage with the topic through lecture and seminar discussion. Through their participation in lectures, seminars, written work, final projects, and feedback offered, students will demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course explores fascinating and sometimes bizarre Christian traditions of food and eating in order to understand consumption, addiction and abstinence today. Its methodology crosses the boundaries between theology, religious studies and biblical studies. By focusing on food and eating, the course encourages students to look at texts and traditions with which they may well be familiar from a new angle. It shows how theology can shape decisions about everyday life and equips students to develop their own constructive theology of food and diet by drawing on a diverse range of texts, traditions and theories.Syllabus/Outline Content:The first half of the course covers biblical and historical material. It opens with a social anthropological reading of Leviticus and an analysis of conflicts around table fellowship in the Pauline communities. It then moves on to the medieval period, covering the desert fathers, monasteries and collective social abstinence, before turning to the Reformation critique of previous practice. The second half of the course focuses on selected issues. It begins with a constructive critique of consumer society followed by a theological appraisal of addiction. Consideration of meat-eating and sacrifice comes next and finally an examination of the idea of eucharistic eating.Student Learning Experience Information:There is one two-hour seminar each week and the course manager is available for consultation at other times. A key text is to be read before each seminar and forms the basis for the seminar teaching and discussion. Each student gives a presentation on one of these texts and may upload the presentation or its text to the Learn site for use by other course members. The assessment comprises the presentation and seminar participation, a coursework essay and a written exam.",

The first half of the course will seek to gender Muslim history, unearthing the realities, roles, and contributions of women and queer people in different 'moments' in Muslim pasts, in particular the formative period. The second half will pivot to hermeneutical method, exploring the creative ways in which female and queer theologians have reread key Islamic texts - including the Qur'an, hadith (prophetic traditions), Islamic law, and liturgical norms - in order to produce more gender inclusiveand egalitarian spaces through an Islamic discursive framework. Throughout the course, broader ethical issues will be thematically engaged from a feminist perspective, including (but not limited to) ontological equality, leadership, religious authority, sexual pleasure and fulfilment, reproductive rights, and bodily well-being / harm.Student Learning Experience:Engagement with primary source material in translation - in particular the Qur'an and early Islamic texts - is a central part of the learning journey, supplemented by secondary source readings. The weekly lecture will provide a broader framing and contextualisation of the weekly topic, and the tutorials will be devoted to discussing the themes, debates, and engrained assumptions within the assigned texts.

Students will engage with a number of human rights and feminist debates, and how they have been placed in a critical conversation with the Islamic intellectual tradition.Content:Islamic feminist theology is the most sophisticated genre within the broader field of Islamic liberation theology, that is, interpretive approaches to Islamic texts that are committed to social justice and inclusion. This course explores the complex relationship between Islam and gender, focusing on the creative ways in which Muslim feminist scholars \u00c2\u00bf women, men, and non-binary - have attempted to reread scripture and tradition with an eye to gender equality and social inclusion. The course will begin by focusing on the Qur'an, as the foundational text of the Muslim faith, and its tafsir (interpretation). It will then engage the wider Islamic tradition, including hadith (prophetic reports), sunnah (prophetic custom), shari\u00c2\u00bfa (Islamic law), and liturgy. In addition to addressing issues directly related to Muslim women, from ontological equality and patriarchal representations of the divine to religious authority, leadership, economic in/dependence, and bodily well-being and harm, we will explore queer readings of Islamic texts and the emergent field of Muslim masculinities.

    "course_description": "Academic Description:In an unjust world, what role can religion play in the struggle for human rights and the alleviation of suffering? This is the question that drives liberation theology, one of the most influential theological movements of the twentieth-century. Using a comparative framework, this course offers a critical overview of liberation theology's development in Christianity and Islam. After analyzing the historical origins of liberation theology, we will examine a number of thematic categories, including class, race, and gender. Throughout the course, students will reflect on the following larger questions: How does social context shape our understanding of God, scripture, and religion as a whole? Whose lived experience gets to become 'the norm', the point of departure for theological reflection? How is religious authority construed and what are its social ramifications? Finally, how have Christians and Muslims (re)interpreted the Bible and Qur'an, respectively, through a liberating lens? That is, which new methods are they using, how do they depart from inherited, traditional methods, and what are the possibilities and potential pitfalls of these new methods?Syllabus/Outline Content:This course is based on comparative analysis, encouraging students to draw linkages (and discrepancies) between Christian and Muslim contexts. The weeks alternate between Christianity and Islam - rather than having half of the course devoted to Christianity and the other half to Islam - precisely to encourage such comparative reflection. Hence, it is the categories of analysis (namely: class, race, and gender) which are the driving frameworks of the course, contrasting Christian and Islamic perspectives. The course concludes by assessing criticisms of liberation theology by the Vatican and mainstream Islamic seminaries.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course aims to enrich students' engagement with Hindu traditions in South Asia by using visual and textual materials. Visual materials such as documentary and film will be used to illustrate the diversity of Hindu traditions. Complementing the visual element will be readings dealing with empirical case studies that enable consideration of how traditions are negotiated on the ground and their value for broader comparative and theoretical discussions. One of the important aspects of this course is to look at understudied aspects of South Asia, particularly its tribal and indigenous communities and their engagement with Hindu and other traditions. These debates will be carefully considered both in the lectures and the seminar discussions based on visual and textual material that are both empirically rich and theoretically innovative.Syllabus/Outline Content:The complexity and richness of the course will be illustrated through thematic considerations such as deities, caste, gender, karma, dharma, fundamentalism, pilgrimage, gurus, and 'tribes'. It will utilise key anthropological and historical texts that examine the richness of the region, while using video documentaries and film to illustrate and visually aid how Hindu traditions negotiate the different social/religious/political boundaries.Student Learning Experience Information:The course has a programme of two-hour weekly meetings consisting of one-hour weekly lectures and video, and one-hour seminar discussions. The meetings will be interactive and will allow students to engage with the topic through lecture/video and seminar discussion. Each student will do a presentation based on the assigned reading and will be responsible for leading class discussion during the seminar hour. Students are also required to write a weekly-assessed blog that will demonstrate their understanding and engagement with the readings.

This course looks at modern efforts to find the historical man behind the Christian gospels, focussing on particular aspects of his life (his Galilean context, his healings, apocalyptic teaching etc) and asking what historical factors led to his death.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course will start by situating Jesus in his Galilean context, looking at the history of the area and its level of Hellenisation. Next, we look at sources for the historical Jesus - how reliable are the canonical gospels? Can any other sources be brought into the discussion? After this, we shall look at a number of topics from Jesus' life and ministry: his birth, abilities as a healer and exorcist, teaching, and relations with other holy men (particularly the Pharisees). Finally we shall look at the reasons for his death, and the empty tomb traditions.Student Learning Experience Information:The class will meet once a week for a two-hour seminar. Most seminars will be student led (with a 10 minute presentation), followed by class discussion, directed by the course lecturer. Sometimes we will have book reviews, and there will also be a debate (on how far Jesus was 'apocalyptic.' Besides class reading, students will be encouraged to read two contrasting recent portraits of the historical Jesus, and to be aware of the range of views of Jesus on offer within modern scholarship. Participants will demonstrate their achievement of intended learning outcomes through seminar presentations and contributions, the class essay, and the final exam.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course introduces biblical Hebrew - the language of ancient Israel/Judah, in which the Tanakh/Old Testament was written. The course is accessible to absolute beginners, and assumes no prior knowledge of the language. Students begin by learning the alphabet and writing system, followed by systematically studying grammar and incrementally acquiring vocabulary. Their learning is consolidated throughout the course through exercises, translations, and short quizzes. By the end of the course, they are able to read simple Hebrew prose and conduct a detailed examination of a set text taken from the Hebrew Bible.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course begins with an introduction to the alphabet and writing system, followed by a systematic review of grammar. The precise order of material may vary from year to year, but the following grammatical elements will be covered: nouns, adjectives, and particles; the strong verb (qal); the strong verb (other binyanim); the weak verb. This is supplemented by incremental vocabulary acquisition and frequent translation exercises. The course ends with a detailed study of a short narrative text from the Hebrew Bible, such as the first creation account (Genesis 1) or the Akedah (Genesis 22). Students will explore the grammatical, syntactic, and exegetical features of this text.Student Learning Experience Information:Students attend class four times per week to ensure progressive consolidation of their learning. In three of these classes, they will be taught new grammatical concepts. In the fourth, they will review what they've learnt and may participate in a short quiz. All sessions are thoroughly interactive, with plenty of opportunity for students to practice their new skills and to receive instant feedback from the teacher. In-class assessment provides students with a helpful gauge of their progression, and practice at exam-style questions. Students may supplement their in-class learning through independent study and homework assignments.",

    "summary": "The Syriac tradition is one of the oldest in the history of Christianity. Spanning 2,000 years, Classical Syriac literature encompasses multiple genres, including some of the most ancient translations of the Bible, the earliest Christian poetry, and an important witness to Christian-Muslim interactions. Currently, however, only a handful of institutions in the world offer training in this subject. This course (open to levels 8-11) will provide students with a foundational introduction to Syriac as language and field.",
    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionThis course introduces students to Classical Syriac - the language of one of the most ancient traditions of Christianity. The course is accessible to absolute beginners and assumes no prior knowledge. Students begin by learning the alphabet and writing system, followed by a systematic study of grammar, syntax, and will acquire new vocabulary each week. Learning will be consolidated through short translation exercises and vocab quizzes. By the end of the course, students will be able to read simple Syriac prose, and conduct a detailed final exam of a set text taken from a 4th-century homily.Outline ContentThe course begins with an introduction to the alphabet, vocalic system, and pronunciation followed by a systematic overview of grammar. Elements of grammar will include: nouns (emphatic, absolute, construct); active and passive participles; strong and weak verbs (forms I-VI). This is supplemented by incremental vocabulary acquisition and frequent translation exercises from various textbooks. The course ends with an examination of a short extract of a homily by Ephrem of Syria (d. 373). Students will be required to analyse and parse out the grammatical, syntactic, and theological features of this text.Student Learning ExperienceThe course meets four times a week. The course tutor will explain new grammar, but students are encouraged to ask questions and actively engage with the course material. This includes students being required to not only read and translate sentences in Syriac but to also analyse and parse out their grammar. There is an expectation that students will come prepared for lessons and go over each class in their own time, memorising vocabulary, verb forms, and other aspects of the language. There will also be an audio-visual component of the teaching, namely video and tape recordings of Syriac recitation in liturgical settings by members of the community. This will provide students with a sense of the language as a living tradition. Students will demonstrate their achievements through class tests and a final exam.",

While the emphasis falls on Greek-to-English, learning is reinforced through English-to-Greek exercises.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course assumes no background in the language and begins with mastering the alphabet, the case system for nouns, and the verbal system. The syntax of koine Greek is also a focus of study. Students will acquire a vocabulary of the most frequently used words in the Greek New Testament (about 300 words used 50+ times are tackled, which represent about 80% of all word-occurrences in the NT). Furthermore, they will demonstrate a basic understanding of the significance of selected features of koine Greek grammar for exegesis of the New Testament.Student Learning Experience Information:The course has four class sessions each week in which the grammatical concepts are explained and put to use in exercises. Each fortnight the fourth class will also involve an in-class test. These in-class tests will cover vocabulary, grammar, and translations. All four sessions provide ample opportunity for immediate feedback and practicing the 'oral' aspects of the language. A cumulative mid-semester test provides a helpful checkpoint, as well as giving practice in the kind of assessment faced in the in-class final exam.",

The course encompasses contexts in history and today, and ranges in geographical focus.

Concepts such as 'dialogue' and 'pluralism' will be problematised and examined in their historical and religious contexts.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course aims to explore different contexts of contact between Jews and non-Jews in order to enable a better understanding of the range of relationships between people of different religious traditions, cultures, languages, ethnicity and so on. How Jews relate to non-Jews is as much topic as the reverse, how non-Jews relate to Jews. The concepts mentioned in the subtitle: coexistence, conflict and co-operation serve as broad structuring devices for the course, allowing the categorisation of examples while also asking for these categories to be critically explored. And concepts such as 'dialogue' and 'pluralism' will be problematised and examined in their historical and religious contexts.Syllabus/Outline Content:Students will read a variety of primary sources, such as, but not limited to, plays, political pamphlets or speeches, religious treatises, literary texts, cartoons, scholarship and so on. The primary sources will be read alongside the expanding scholarship on Jewish/non-Jewish relations in different Humanities disciplines.Student Learning Experience Information:The course consists of a lecture component and seminar discussion. The lecture component will be taught as a 'flipped classroom', either with an in-person lecture or with lecture materials provided online via Learn. To prepare for the seminar students need to engage with the set primary sources and an appropriate range of secondary readings. During the semester, students will complete 3 short assignments that practice analysis and interpretation of sources. The format of these will vary to engage with different writing and presentation styles. The short assignments are a key part of the formative and summative assessment in this course and directly inform seminar discussion. A class essay and a final exam test the learning outcomes for this course.",

    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionThis course investigates the significance and scope of practice for theology. Working in the wake of the participative turn to practice as accentuated in recent sociological and theological reflections on lived religion, the course places students in the Charteris Centre in Edinburgh, a community hub for people from religious and non-religious backgrounds, run by Greyfriars Kirk. In a structured and supportive course environment, students conceptualise and conduct their own research projects on a theological issue that presents itself in the work of the Centre.

Thus, students analyse and assess theology as it is actually practiced, while impacting and improving the work of the Centre through their expertise.OutlineThe course is organised around the students' placement in the Charteris Centre in Edinburgh. These placements run in addition to weekly sessions. Framed by Introduction and Conclusion that cover the requirements and the results of research on theology in practice, these weekly sessions cover the challenges that confront students while they conceptualise and conduct their own research projects. Concentrating on the students experience and exploration of the practice of the Charteris Centre, the workshops consider sociological and theological conceptualisations of practice, including a variety of methodological approaches to theology as it is lived.Student Learning ExperienceThe course is structured around the students' placement in the Charteris Centre in Edinburgh. These placements run in addition to weekly seminar sessions. While there will be lectures that cover the sociological and theological conceptualisations of practice in theology, most of the weekly seminar sessions will be workshops on the challenges that students encounter in conceptualising and conducting their own research project. Practitioners working at the Charteris Centre may join these sessions from time to time. The set texts are selected in accordance with the students' research projects, but students are expected to research literature on their own.Students are assessed in three consecutive and complementary steps: (1) a presentation on the theological issue that they would like to research, (2) a portfolio of fieldwork notes that identifies the core concern and the core concepts of their research, and (3) a 3000-word essay presenting their research. Through these assessments, students demonstrate the achievement of the learning outcomes of the course.",

From stories of vows to future Buddhahood, to tales of talking animals, jatakas offer a fascinating lens through which to view developments in Buddhist ethics and ideology. Through studying this particularly rich and influential genre of early Indian literature, we will come to a better understanding of Buddhist values and attitudes, as well as of the ways in which narrative forms a crucial expression of religious ideas.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course will proceed through key themes in early Buddhism, drawing on appropriate primary readings as we go. Themes include animal and human ethics; the role of the Buddha as teacher; karmic consequences and karmic communities; the path to Buddhahood and the perfections required for that attainment; the Buddha's good and bad karma; stories of extraordinary generosity or self-sacrifice; and the role of women in the stories.Student Learning Experience Information:The course will be delivered through a weekly two-hour class. The first hour will consist of student-led discussion of readings from primary texts (in translation). In some weeks this will involve student presentations. The second hour will be a discussion, led by the lecturer, of key themes and concepts that will enable full comprehension of the following week's readings; depending on covid-related restrictions on room capacity this hour may be replaced with pre-recorded online materials. Assessment is through class presentations (20%), a 2,000-word essay (30%) consisting of a close analysis of a primary source text, and a final 3,000-word essay (50%) that explores a key theme in relation to both primary and secondary scholarship.

It is for 3rd and 4th year students in the School of Divinity, including those also studying Philosophy. The other major figures studied are Hegel, Nietzsche and Heidegger.",
    "course_description": "Academic description:Immanuel Kant developed a new understanding of the purpose and use of reason. Refuting the speculative use of reason to prove ultimate truths about God, the world, and human existence, he refocused on morality and practical reason. The modern German tradition, which Kant founded, has been tremendously important both intellectually and politically. Ongoing themes, which the course traces through subsequent thinkers include autonomy, the state, and the link between reason and experience. Religious belief and its relation, if any, to moral belief is also a key issue.Syllabus/outline content:The course begins with Kants argument from moral action to God and examines some practical implications of his metaphysics of morals. It then moves on to assess the role of ethics in G.W.F. Hegel and its place in state and society. The third figure covered is Friedrich Nietzsche, and his attempted move beyond good and evil is appraised. Next comes Martin Heideggers critique of onto-theology and the social assumptions that he regarded as following from it. The final philosopher is Hannah Arendt, whose political and social critique is related to the course themes.Student learning experience information:There is one two-hour seminar each week and the course organiser is available for consultation at other times. A key text is to be read before each seminar and forms the basis for the seminar teaching and discussion. Each student gives a presentation on one of these texts. The assessment comprises the presentation and seminar participation, a coursework essay and a written exam. Although the course includes some demanding material, the seminar provides the opportunity for this to be discussed and understood, including through practical examples.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:The course aims to enrich students' knowledge and understanding of the theology, context and practice of Christian mission in contemporary Scotland, set in UK and global context. In order to achieve this, it will consider the interaction of Christian faith with society in words and actions through (a) the history and development of the theology and practice of mission since World War II; (b) present day global mission theology; and (c) present expressions of, and the future potential for, emerging missional ecclesiologies in Scotland and beyond.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course will combine missiology, theology, ecclesiology and church/ social history.Particular themes will include: the meaning and purpose of mission; the Bible and mission (missional hermeneutics); Gospel, 'contextualisation' and culture; current global theologies of mission; the recent history of mission in Scotland since World War II, focusing on its dynamic re-energisation from 1945 to 1970 through such as Tom Allan and George MacLeod above; the current context of secularisation, inter-faith relationships and institutional church decline; and emerging missional ecclesiologies, being 'fresh expressions of church' through pioneer ministry and church planting.Student Learning Experience Information:At each seminar, a short video presentation by the relevant student(s) will begin the discussion. Each student will therefore be required to provide a short video presentation on the key reading texts, to be shared at one seminar during the semester. Through participation in the discussion forum, providing the presentation and in seminar discussions, as well as through written work and the examination, students will seek to achieve the learning outcomes. Participation will be assessed on the nature and extent of engagement in the discussion forums and the seminars.",

The course both orients students to the wide landscape of modern theology in this profoundly formative age, and also provides for detailed investigation of central issues.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course aims to explore the development of theology in the 19th century, the foundational era for modern Christian thought. It examines key thinkers and themes in theology and religious life in their various contexts, tracing the notable developments and innovations across the period. The impact of cultural, social, political, and scientific changes on theology's development, and vice versa, will be considered. The course addresses both larger historical transformations and specific theological issues in order to be critically conversant with theology as it was re-imagined from the Enlightenment and French Revolution to the end of the First World War, and to engage with ongoing debates about the relationship between theology and modernity.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course begins by considering the nature of theological enquiry at the threshold of the 19th century. After discussing the Enlightenment and French Revolution, it considers the role of Romanticism and Idealism in shaping theological reflection in figures such as Friedrich Schleiermacher, G. W. F. Hegel, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Attention is given to various prominent critiques of the Bible and religion offered by key thinkers in the period, for instance D. F. Strauss, S\u00c3\u00b8ren Kierkegaard, and Friedrich Nietzsche, and the major attempts to construct theological programmes in response. Questions of secularisation and important instances of theological renewal and religious revival are considered together. The course concludes by examining the fate of the notable syntheses characteristic of the 19th century, the relation of theology to modern culture, and the rise of new theological and religious movements in the face of the First World War.Student Learning Experience Information:The course involves one two-hour seminar per week, which will consist of a combination of lectures and engaged discussion based on readings prepared in advance. Each student will be required to make two short presentations. Through discussions, written assignments, and an examination, students will demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes.",

Muslims and Christians refer to Jesus as the Messiah, a prophet, a Word from God, and the son of Mary. And yet, Christians and Muslims also have had fundamental disagreements about Jesus that profoundly shape their theologies, scriptural interpretation, religious practices, and rituals. This comparative course offers a critical historical, scriptural, philosophical, and theological analysis of the importance of Jesus to both Islam and Christianity and how differing understandings of Jesus have fundamentally impacted Christian-Muslim Relations. Students will consider the relationship between the Qur'anic narratives of Jesus and Late Antiquite Christianity and Judaism, explore classical polemics, apologetics, and mystical depictions of Jesus in the Islamicate world, and critically evaluate contemporary proposals for understanding Jesus' role and legacy in Christian-Muslim Relations. Throughout the course students will engage in a dialogical and comparative studySyllabus/Outline Content:The course is divided into three major sections. The first scrutinizes the Qur'anic and Hadith material on Jesus, locating these texts and traditions within both Late Antique Christianity and early Islamic history. The course will investigate the historical, social, and religious contexts in which early Islamic depictions and understandings of Jesus emerged, giving particular critical attention to various theories of around the Jewish and Christian resonances or influences on the Qur'an. Students will study questions of history, influence, and the differing function of the New Testament and Qur'an. The second section offers a close study of classical understanding of Jesus in Christian-Muslim Relations, focusing primarily on the Islamicate contexts from approximately 800-1400 common era. Themes to be considered may include prophetology, the unity of God and divinity of Christ, ritual practices of worship and veneration, the death of Jesus, the Mahdi, and mysticism. The final section examines modern understandings of Jesus, both from Christian and Muslim perspectives, that attempt to articulate the meaning and significance of Jesus in the context of contemporary Christian-Muslim debate. Throughout students will engage in a dialogical study that considers how understandings of Jesus impact Islamic and Christian ritual practices, scriptural readings, prophetology, theologies of God, political visions, and ethics.Student Learning Experience Information:The course will be delivered in the form of eleven weekly two-hour sessions. The first half of each session will be devoted to a lecture, and the second half to a discussion-based seminar focused on in-depth analysis and discussion of the assigned readings. Students are expected to complete the assigned readings for each week and to come prepared to discuss the issues, questions, and perspectives raised in the readings. Students will be assessed on their in class presentations, research essay, and exam. By mid-way through the course, the instructor will meet with students to discuss their final research essay and offer comment on their outlines. Through their class participation and assignments, students will demonstrate their achievement of the learning outcomes.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course investigates the modern field of popular beliefs and practices known as 'new spiritualities'. It aims to describe, contextualize and explain key features of this field with reference to their content and structure, and to its distribution in the population at large. The course focuses on new age and holistic expressions. It has three overall goals: to explore the theoretical value of studying new spiritualities, to explain their international/transcultural appeal for practitioners, and to critically assess their social, public and political significance in modern societies.Syllabus/Outline Content:We begin with the problem of demarcating a hyper-fluid field of beliefs and practices that crosses traditional boundaries of 'religious' and 'secular'. We examine definitions of 'spirituality', 'holistic' and 'new age' and discuss the grounds of their inclusion within the comparative study of religion/s. We explore the role of authorities and traditions in the development of a culture of seekership spread via networks, small groups and other 'glocal' institutions. We consider evidence for an emerging new spiritual cosmology, and using both qualitative and quantitative data we trace the permeation of new spiritual beliefs and practices into everyday life settings, including health, wellbeing and psychology. Familiarity with primary sources will be emphasized, drawing on selections of writings by illustrative 'new spirituality' authors, and on material gathered by students themselves for their field report.Student Learning Experience Information:Lectures are based around presentations from the lecturer and include some audio-visual content. Background readings are set for each week's topics. Tutorials are student-led discussions of set readings based on a full bibliography built into the syllabus.Students will demonstrate their completion of the intended learning outcomes through a combination of lecture and tutorial activities, by the preparation of an essay, and by completion of an exam. The essay will require attention to points and themes crossing two or more weeks, and the exam will require one question to be answered from three sections covering the entire course, with the aim to achieve a whole course coverage in assessment.",

Newman had a profound impact in his own lifetime on both the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches, and the influence of his thought is felt today far beyond the confines of those two communions. His engagement with questions of historicity and with the rapidly developing scientific thought and biblical criticism of the later nineteenth century did much to propel the Churches into the modern world. We will follow the outline of Newman\u00c2\u00bfs life, reading, week by week, sections from his most important and influential works, including the Apologia pro Vita Sua, An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine, Loss and Gain, and The Idea of a University.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course aims to enrich students' understanding of and appreciation for the contribution of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament (HB/OT) to theological study and reflection. Central theological questions are used to structure an investigation of the breadth of theological responses to them found in the HB/OT. Historically, biblical theology has been a part of the tradition of Christian interpretation, so its discussions and interests predominate in the course. However, during the 20th C. it came increasingly to be discussed by Jewish biblical scholars, and attention is paid to these contributions as well.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course begins by providing an orientation to the history of biblical theology, and the contributions of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament in particular. Fundamental theological questions structure the course: how can God be known? How is the character of God to be understood? What does it mean to be human? Who are the 'people of God'? What is sin, and what does it mean to be 'saved'? What is the nature of future hope? And, a key theological theme for later religious developments, how is the 'messiah' to be understood in Jewish and Christian perspectives?Student Learning Experience Information:The course has weekly meetings with sessions in two-hour blocks. All sessions are seminar based and active participation is expected. The seminars may include, for example, lecture-style sections, textual analysis, thematic discussion, debate, and examination of visual artefacts. Brief pieces of weekly preparatory work form a 'portfolio' which contributes to assessment. Students will demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes through these, participation in discussion, a substantial interpretative essay investigating a particular passage or problem from the set text, and the final examination.",

The parables will be situated in their original context(s) and read from a variety of modern perspectives. Their influence in ecclesiastical and cultural settings will be considered. The course draws on the fields of both Biblical Studies and Theology and Ethics, and brings inter-disciplinary, literary, theological and cultural concerns to bear on these influential biblical texts.Course Summary:The course will begin by situating the parables in their historical and literary setting in the Bible and in the life of Jesus. The influence of readings by the early church will be followed by a critical discussion of major hermeneutical shifts in parable research in the twentieth century, including the readings of Jeremias and Crossan, and feminist and socio-critical readings. The influence of parables in pastoral care and preaching, and in popular culture, will also be traced. Key parables, such as the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son, will be considered in particular detail.Student Learning Experience:The course involves one two-hour seminar per week, which will consist of a combination of lecture-style presentations and discussion based on readings prepared in advance. Each student will be required to give a short presentation at one seminar during the semester on the text for the day.

    "course_description": "Academic Description:The course aims to explore the nuanced understanding of pastoral care and theology as it has been developed throughout both Christian history and the history of psychological development. Starting with pastoral theology as it was understood in relation to the leadership of the established church and moving through to its development as an aspect of practical theology, the students will be able to see how theological concepts adapt in the academy. Through the analysis of the practice of pastoral care in real-life scenarios, students will also be able to use their understanding of pastoral theology in an applied way. Finally, students will be able to take their understandings of pastoral care and theology and see how it applies to contemporary issues that face the church and the wider religious community today.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course will cover theoretical issues in the field, as well as offering an historical survey of selected theological texts. Themes including psychology, pastoral theology, stages of development, spirituality, and the contemporary church will be covered. Application of the understandings of pastoral care will be applied to contemporary case studies for discussion and debate.Student Learning Experience Information:The students will read a selection of texts on the relevant topic each week. There will be a time in class for discussion of the texts as well as any questions raised. This will be followed by a more structured lecture on the topic at hand.

Through this analysis and engagement with specific artwork and pertinent secondary literature, students will investigate the ambivalent role of the arts in peacebuilding and its complex relation to religion and diverse theologies. Detailed analysis will focus upon how individual works can contribute to building peace, and interact with religious traditions, beliefs and practices.Syllabus/Content Outline:Different kinds of art created will be considered in detail, including: visual arts (weeks 1-2), photography (week 3), film (5-6), theatre and dance (7-8), literature (9-10), and music (11). These case studies will be based upon one introductory week (1), which will lay the theoretical and practical foundations for the analysis and case studies that follow. Students will be strongly encouraged by the end of the first two weeks to have read set Introductory texts to lay the necessary theoretical foundations.Student Learning Experience:The course involves one two-hour seminar per week and one one-hour tutorial in smaller groups. The full class seminar (2hrs) will consist of a combination of interactive lecture-style presentations, discussion and analysis of both the primary and secondary texts. Students will be required to research and then present to the class example relevant to the week's theme. The smaller tutorial groups (1hr) will provide the opportunity for students to discuss the week's set text(s) in greater detail. Each student will normally be required to give a short presentation on the text for the day at one tutorial during the semester. Through participation in seminars, prepared readings and tutorial discussions, as well as through the written work included in the assessment schedule, students will demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:'Political Islam' is a term that has dominated public debate, particularly after momentous historical events, from the Iranian Revolution in 1979 to 9/11 to the Arab Spring. But what, exactly, is this phenomenon? Why did it arise? Who are its principal thinkers and from which segment of the population does it draw the bulk of its support? How does it organize itself? What are its national, global, social, economic, and gendered demands? Indeed, to what extent can we refer to political Islam as a singular movement - 'it' - and, if we cannot, what binds diverse political Islamic groups together? That is, what sets them apart from other political parties in Muslim societies? This course will engage these questions by offering both a historic and thematic survey of political Islamic thought.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course is comprised of two components:1. 'Conceptual Framing' - sets the stage for discussion by assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the frameworks often used to analyze the phenomenon at hand. These include (but are not limited to) 'Political Islam', 'Muslim Politics' and 'Islamism'. This component will also provide the broader historical and global backdrop in which political Islamic thought emerged.2. 'Thinkers and their Contexts' - represents the bulk of the course, offering case studies of the pioneering thinkers in political Islamic thought. Through reading primary texts in translation, students will be directly exposed to their writings. At the same time, students will contextualize their ideas by examining their social settings.A Note on Teaching Format:The lectures will be in-person and all students are expected to have completed the weekly readings before the lecture. This will be particularly important for the tutorial that will directly follow the lecture, as the tutorial will be discussion-based and students should be prepared to engage the issues, questions, and perspectives raised in the readings. If any students need to self-isolate, the lectures will be recorded and the tutorials will be streamed live (though not recorded). This digital option is only a last resort; unless they are sick or self-isolating, students must be present at both the lectures and tutorials.",

However, it also looks at capacious forms of spirituality beyond them. It draws from mostly contemporary but also some historical examinations and perspectives, bringing together insights from the humanities and the social sciences, interrogating social and cultural configurations, while situating them in a broader global genealogical lineage.",
    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionThis course offers an introductory exploration into the complex dynamics between racialisation and religiosity. It sets up a strong foundation in critical race studies and closely engages with a variety of disciplines such as Black Studies; Social Anthropology; Human Geography; Religious Studies; Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies, and Latin American and Caribbean Studies. This module will explore topics through a variety of empirical perspectives such as fine-grained ethnographic examples, examinations of material culture, and insights from the arts (music, dance, literature, etc.) whilst also offering an introduction to foundational theoretical considerations that include but also go beyond political sovereignty, questions of ontology, and globalisation.Outline ContentIn each week, the module will focus on a different theme (although they are all overlapping) and investigates how these themes speak to the socio-cultural formations and power structures of both race and religiosity, taking each processually rather than as static categories.  The encounters and intersections between race and religiosity are multifaceted and require critical foundations in some knowledge of racial theory which underwrites each class, as such the module will also offer some preliminary background context to the study of race.Student Learning ExperienceThe module has a programme of one hour lectures supplemented by a standard tutorial. The lectures will include as much discussion as possible as well as interactive elements. Additionally, the resources\u00c2\u00bfas much as possible\u00c2\u00bfwill be multimodal, with the inclusion of short and longer videos, podcasts, and where applicable and possible, art exhibits (virtual and/or in person.)

It considers especially the relation between intellectual, social, political and religious forces and the ways in which these combined to shape national and confessional identities, to promote cohesion, and to sow the seeds of future conflict and division. It also looks at the impact of all these changes, both positive and negative, on the lives and beliefs of ordinary men and women, examining them as both passive recipients and active shapers of reformation.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course enables students to examine the complex series of reformations which occurred in England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland over the course of the sixteenth century. In particular, it considers the relation between intellectual, social, political and religious forces and the ways in which these combined to shape national and confessional identities, to promote cohesion, and to sow the seeds of future conflict and division. It does so through the reading and analysing of key texts, both primary and secondary, from a range of different national and confessional perspectives. At the same time students will be encouraged to integrate these perspectives into a wider narrative of Reformation in Britain and Ireland.Syllabus/Outline Content:See below for a prospective outline (precise topics may be subject to change). The course begins with a common pre-Reformation narrative concerning late medieval Catholicism and reform in the four nations. From here it moves on to consider the distinctive features of the different national reformations, particularly considering the way in which Tudor dynastic politics impacted the successive Henrician, Edwardian and Marian Reformations in England, Wales and Ireland. The narrative then links into the Scottish Reformation and the religious settlement of 1560, offering opportunity for comparison with the very different 'Elizabethan consensus' operating in the Tudor realms. The course concludes with an account of different threats to that consensus (e.g. Catholic, Presbyterian) and the consequent divergent paths of national reformation in the latter half of the sixteenth century.Week 1: Late Medieval Church and SocietyWeek 2: Heresy and ReformWeek 3: The Henrician ReformationWeek 4: The Edwardian ReformationWeek 5: The Marian Reaction and Marian ExileWeek 6: The Scottish ReformationWeek 7: Establishing the Scottish KirkWeek 8: The Elizabethan Religious SettlementWeek 9: The Reformation in WalesWeek 10: Reformation and Counter-Reformation in IrelandWeek 11: Convergent and Divergent ReformationsStudent Learning Experience Information:This Level 10 course follows a programme of one two-hour seminar per week, including a lecture component and seminar discussion. Students' preparatory reading of sources will enable comparative analysis of different aspects of national reformations. Students will also have the opportunity apply their knowledge through weekly blogs and blog comments. Each student will write one main blog (c. 800 words) per semester and will also write weekly comments (c. 100 words) on other student blogs. The blogs and comments will inform class discussion of the texts and will be an important component of summative assessment. Students will be offered formative feedback on their comments in week 6.",

    "summary": "A study of central issues at stake in the varieties of Reformation that took root across Continental Europe in the 16th century. The course uses key texts from Luther, Calvin, Anabaptist and Catholic reformers. It sets the documents and their authors in context, historically and theologically. It considers continuities/discontinuities with late medieval thought. It explores the directions reform thought took within the Protestant movement, and in Catholic settings. It analyses the character and consequences of the polemics that divided Europe.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course allows students to gain knowledge and understanding of Protestant and Catholic reform movements in Continental Europe, c.1475-1600. It looks at the intellectual, social, cultural contexts in which reform took root; the hinterland in late medieval life and thought; the positions adopted by different parties on central themes in debate, such as justification by faith alone, the nature of Christ's presence at the Eucharist, the authority of Scripture/tradition; the impact of printed propaganda on the character of Reformation debate; the cohesive and divisive pressures of confessional division within Continental Europe. Students will study key 16th century texts in translation, to interpret their historical and theological significance. They will become familiar with the variety of approaches taken in recent Reformation scholarship.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course starts with an introduction to recent writing on the Reformation, and to significant currents in late medieval religious life and theology. Then the focus is on Luther and the German reform movement of the 1520s. The parallel reform movement in Zurich and Swiss cantons is explored through the conflict that developed between Luther and the Swiss reformer Zwingli. Following this, attention turns to radicals such as Anabaptists, who resisted the mainstream (magisterial) Reformation and were persecuted and marginalised as a result. Moving forward into the 1530s, the course then looks at the second generation of Protestant reform, represented by religious change in Geneva, the work of Calvin, and the international spread of the Reformed tradition. The final third of the course looks at Catholic reform movements, from the common ground of late medieval religion to the decisive rejection of Protestantism at the Council of Trent. The last session is an opportunity to look at the character and consequences of Europe's divisions over religion.After the first week, the pattern of teaching will typically be a one-hour seminar discussion of pre-assigned texts, followed by a one-hour lecture that provides background for the following week's texts.1. Recent writing on the Reformation; late medieval background2. Luther's protest3. Luther's ideas, and how and where they took root4. Conflict and controversy5. Radical reformers6. The Reformation in Geneva7. Calvin's Institutes8. Reform thought in Catholic circles9. Catholic mysticism and devotion10. The Council of Trent11. Europe dividedStudent Learning Experience Information:The class meets for two hours a week, typically for a one-hour seminar discussion of pre-assigned texts, followed by a one-hour lecture that provides background for the following week's texts. A course reader will be provided. The LEARN site for the course will run a blog from week 2: each week, all students will be asked to contribute a comment on seminar texts of 100-150 words, to feed into discussion. Each student will be allocated a seminar to co-lead and facilitate, with a presentation of no more than 10 minutes. Students will be offered formative feedback on their presentations and at other appropriate points. Students will be provided with titles and bibliographies for the coursework essay, and will be offered a preparatory meeting with the course manager to discuss their choice of essay topic.",

This course seeks to investigate the complexities of cultural formation in the Middle East. From early Christian Arabists in the Levantine and Druze intellectuals investigating Islamic civilizational decline and renovation to the rise of televangelism and embattled religiosities after the Arab Spring, this course applies a multi-method approach to the question of culture and cultural production. Students will have the opportunity to explore the question of religion and culture in film, music, literature, news reports (in translation) as well as exploring secondary literature.",
    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionThis course provides students with an intradisciplinary approach to the study of religion, religious communities, intellectuals, revolutionaries, and reformists in culture-making in the modern Middle East. It covers a wide range of topics that highlight the complexity and internal diversity of cultural and religious formations from the early 19th century to the present day. By incorporating a study of primary sources - such as film, intellectual scholarship from the region, and news articles - to burgeoning literature, this course aims at a well rounded and expansive understanding of religion and culture. It will highlight the ways in which the the experiences the Middle East has had with modernization, secularization, religious resurgence, and conflict  are contested both in society and in scholarship. As such, the goal of this course is to orient students to a deeper understanding of the political, social, cultural, and religious transformations that have developed as a result of modernity and modernization in the Middle East.Outline ContentThe course aims to provide students with pertinent skills that enables them to develop broader understandings of religion and culture in the modern Middle East. Beginning from a study of the religious, intellectual, and political history to sectarian relations, gender, and religious revivalism. The course provides students with deeper insights into the role religious communities have played in culture-making in different political settings and historical moments. The topics this course covers ranges from the role of 19th and 20th century Christian intellectuals, Jewish revolutionaries, and Muslim and Druze thinkers and reformists in building the intellectual foundations of Arabism, communism, and Pan-Islamism. It will then examine the cultural impact of religious revival in the media as well as it pertains to debates on womanhood, piety, and agency and the role televangelists had in propagating for this revival. The course explores the question of embattled identities in the Middle East: from debates within Israel/Palestine about Druze identities and Mizrahi Jewish belonging. Students will also study the wide representations of Muslim-Christian relations in film - particularly in the Lebanese and Egyptian contexts as well as sectarian relations in the aftermath of the Iraq war. Finally, the course explores religion and religious identities during and after the Arab Spring and how religion impacted music and song in the region. In doing so, the students will have a nuanced, historically rooted, geographically and diverse understanding of religion and culture in the modern Middle East.Student Learning ExperienceThe course will include one hour lecture and one-hour seminar and presentations by the students. The lecture will provide the students with a background understanding of the course readings. The one-hour seminar will include a 10 minute student presentation and a class seminar. Furthermore, the syllabus will include films, documentaries, music, and newspaper articles to consult. Students will be assessed on one class presentations and two essays - a mid-semester essay and a final semester essay.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:The aim of this interdisciplinary course is to enable students from a variety of academic backgrounds to engage in religious and ethical debates as these are embodied in literary texts. A range of texts from the field of literatures in English are discussed and their contributions to, and interactions with, wider religious and ethical concerns are explored. In its widest sense, the context of these texts and their authors is established and this includes both the faith perspective and the ethical stance promoted, implied or critiqued in the text.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course draws on the diverse academic backgrounds of both staff and students as it offers opportunities to reflect on contemporary texts from a range of religious and secular traditions. After a session which introduces the approach to be taken, each week a text is set in its context and its contribution to religious and ethical debates of its time is explored. The course concludes with a review of material covered, and an opportunity to prepare for the final essay. As this is a team-taught course, a wide range of texts will be covered, and the specific texts will vary each year according to staff availability. In the past, these have included Graham Greene's The Power and the Glory; James Robertson's The Testament of Gideon Mack; Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials; Ruth Kluger's Still Alive: A Holocaust Girlhood Remembered; Jackie Kay's Fiere; Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Purple Hibiscus.Student Learning Experience Information:Teaching input will involve a lecture and seminar discussion each week. There will be reading set for each week, which will include the key literary text plus secondary literature. Preparation for seminars will also depend on students meeting in advance in autonomous learning groups to discuss issues raised by the set texts. Through participation in seminar discussion, and the coursework essay and final essay, students will demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes.",

    "summary": "Nations have been called imagined communities (Anderson 1991) that speak to the profound need for both legitimacy and belonging, characteristic of our times. This course will address this idea by focusing on the relationships between religion, geopolitics and the emergence of nationalism. The course will investigate the following questions:How do religious nationalism and the spatialising of nationhood, in terms of religion and geography, enable the territorialisation of religion and the nation?How do people envision their nation in terms of myths, symbols, texts, songs and poetry?How do indigenous systems interact with global ones, shaped by discourses on religion and invented tradition in relation to the emergence of the modern nation, and how is this articulated?",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course aims to investigate the manner in which religion and nationalism interact. It will demonstrate that the importance of religion in contemporary debates ranging from nationalism to its place in the public sphere is far from marginal, but central to the way we should think about the global world system. In order to achieve this, the course combines strong theoretical discussions ranging from classical theories from the French Revolution to more recent postcolonial scholarship, alongside detailed case studies from around the world that have many contemporary resonances. These debates will be carefully considered both in the lectures and the seminar discussions based on readings that are both empirically rich and theoretically innovative.Syllabus/Outline Content:The complexity and richness of the course will be illustrated through thematic considerations such as the importance of homeland, gender, mapping, the discourse of ethnic election, postcolonial nationalisms, the relationship between state, nation, religious identities, secularism, to the resurgence of indigenous peoples' place in the world system. It will discuss the ways in which modern theories of nationalism provide a lens through which nations can be understood both in their modern guise and also in the way their roots in antiquity have been central to their identity in the present. It will examine classic books on nationalism such as Imagined Communities by Benedict Anderson; The Ethnic Origin of Nations by Anthony D. Smith; to the importance of postcolonial and poststructuralist thinkers to this debate, such as Partha Chatterjee and Talal Asad.Student Learning Experience Information:The course has a program of two-hour weekly meetings consisting of one-hour weekly lectures, and one-hour seminar discussions. The meetings will be interactive and will allow students to engage with the topic through lecture and seminar discussion. Each student will do a presentation based on the assigned reading and will be responsible for leading class discussion during the seminar hour. Students are also required to write a weekly-assessed blog that will demonstrate their understanding and engagement with the readings. Through their participation in lectures, seminars, written work, final examination, and feedback offered, students will demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes.",

    "course_description": "A. Academic DescriptionThis course explores the religious cultures of the three kingdoms and the theological developments in the early- to mid-seventeenth century. Students will examine religious issues and theological debates in the historical context of events such as the union of the crowns, the Scottish revolution, the Irish rebellion, the English civil war, the regicide, the interregnum, and the restoration. The course will enable students to understand both the religious causes and dynamics of the British revolution.B. Syllabus / Outline Content:The course begins by examining the Protestant cultures in the kingdoms of England (which included Wales), Scotland, and Ireland in the early decades of the seventeenth century, focusing on issues such as polemics, exegesis, sermons, and piety. The course then examines key debates surrounding issues such as ecclesiology, worship, and soteriology that became prevalent in the lead up to the introduction of the National Covenant in 1638. Finally, the course examines the religious dynamics during the turbulent years of the mid-seventeenth century. Attention is given to the character of religious change in the three kingdoms between 1638 and 1660. The final session discusses whether the mid-seventeenth century should be considered a 'world turned upside down'.After the first week, the pattern of teaching will typically be a one-hour seminar discussion of pre-assigned texts, followed by a one-hour lecture that provides background for the following week's texts and discussion.Sample syllabus (precise topics may be subject to change):Week 1: Religion in Britain & Ireland c.1600; Print & PolemicsWeek 2: Scripture & ExegesisWeek 3: Preaching & SermonsWeek 4: Conversion & PietyWeek 5: Ministry & WorshipWeek 6: Calvinism & ArminianismWeek 7: Covenants & CovenantingWeek 8: Rebellion & ResistanceWeek 9: Orthodoxy & ReformWeek 10: Radicals & TolerationWeek 11: World Turned Upside Down?C. Student Learning Experience InformationThe class meets for two hours per week, typically for a seminar discussion of primary texts, followed by a lecture that provides background for the following week's seminar discussion. Students will be expected to post a comment of around 150 words on seminar texts on Learn in advance of the tutorial. Each student will be allocated a seminar to lead and facilitate, with a presentation of no more than 10 minutes. Students will be given the opportunity to receive formative feedback on a short essay plan.",

Through comparisons between indigenous religions, Christianity and Islam the course examines both religious traditions and innovations. It analyses the connection between religion, society and politics. It also explores the coexistence, conflict and imbrication of these various traditions and asks how interaction between distinct religious beliefs and practices is understood by religious practitioners to enrich and/or diminish those traditions.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:The course explores: 1) Current themes and historical background to the study of religion in Africa and its diaspora; 2) In-depth case studies from Africa and its diaspora which enable students to draw wide-ranging comparative conclusions.The course balances cultural interests in the internal working of religions with their social impact on the societies in which they operate. The contemporary social science focus of the lectures is supported by a robust historical understanding of religions in Africa and their study. The course takes a thematic approach to its subject. It uses ethnographic case-studies to explore similar themes which intersect religion and public life and which recur across different religious traditions, in different parts of Africa and the world.Syllabus Outline/Content:In the first weeks of this course the subject will be introduced through discussing ideas of religion, Africa, indigeneity, syncretism and global movements. This will include historical background on the study of Religions in Africa and Diaspora. The following weeks will examine a number of themes which intersect religion and public life and which recur across different religious traditions: healing and wholeness, communication and media, gender and sexuality, transnationalism and diaspora, violence, spiritual and political power.Student Learning Experience Information:The students will study a selection of textual and visual primary and secondary sources on a relevant topic each week. During the class there will be discussion of the sources and opportunities to raise further questions as well as a more formal lecture to introduce the topic and its sources. Assessment will be through an oral presentation of a seminar topic, an essay and an exam. The seminar topic/reading and essay will be on a particular aspect of the course. The exam will cover material from the entire course. The last class will allow students the opportunity to ask questions about relevant material.",

Along with some of the famous historical debates there will be an opportunity to study the ways that science and theology have engaged in constructive dialogue, and have even learnt from each other. The course is available to all Honours level undergraduate students in the School of Divinity (including visiting students), and also students in the College of Humanities and Social Science. The course complements THET10011 Theology and Contemporary Science, which runs in alternate years to this one.Syllabus/Outline Content:Science and religion are often said to be in 'conflict' with each other. The course will begin by exploring the strengths and weaknesses of this 'conflict' hypothesis, and will offer alternative models for understanding the relationship. From there, the course will chart the development of the natural sciences from the early modern period to the modern day, and the part played by Christian theology in this development. Important historical figures such as Galileo, Newton, and Darwin will form key points of focus.Student Learning Experience Information:The course is taught by means of eleven classes, each of which includes core content presented by one of the course teachers, a student presentation, and opportunity for class discussion. Most classes will require a schedule of reading to be carried out in advance. Students will give short assessed presentations as part of each class, and they will be encouraged to take part in class discussion.

    "summary": "This course introduces students to the world of magic in the Islamic world. Dismissed as anti-rational by European colonialism and Islamic reformism, magic and other occult pursuits often played an important role in the religious, political, and intellectual lives of Muslims. Making extensive use of both literary and visual sources, this course will examine how past and present scholars have attempted to define the occult and esoteric. It will outline several themes such as the role of sorcery in everyday life, politics, and the investigation of science. Surveyed topics include astrology, geomancy, treasure hunting, demonology, alchemy, and necromancy.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course will examine key aspects of sorcery in the history of Islam, from the earliest period to the early modern. It will deal specifically with the ways in which ideas about the wondrous and magical informed the religious, intellectual, and political lives of Muslims. It will include discussions about the place of the occult and esoteric in Islamic thought, and the ever-shifting boundaries between magic, science, and nature. As in medieval and renaissance Europe, occult practices among Muslims often involved material objects such as diagrams, amulets, and other paraphernalia. As such, this course will make extensive use of visual as well as literary sources.Syllabus/Outline:This course will apply historical approaches to the concept of sorcery in the Islamic world, with a strong emphasis on scholarly debates and skills for assessing evidence. Themes studied will include: scholarly debates around definitions of categories like 'magic', 'occult', and 'esoteric'; what Muslims in everyday life believed about the 'supernatural'; various discourses on magic in Islamic thought; magical themes in Islamic literature; the influence of the Islamicate occult sciences on medieval and renaissance Europe. The course begins with theories of the occult and esoteric among pre-modern Islamic thinkers and contemporary scholars, and moves onto key themes such as miracles in Islam; foundation legends surrounding arcane texts; connections between magic, cosmology, and the study of nature; jinn and fantastic beasts; divination (astrology, geomancy, and physiognomy); grimoires; talismans; alchemy; and the political uses of magic. The course will end with a discussion about the impact of modernity on magical practices in the Islamicate world. In addition to literary primary sources, students will engage with visual material via digital collections (e.g. magic squares, manuscript illuminations of jinn and marvellous beasts, astrological tables, and amuletic shirts).Student Learning Experience:The course comprises a one-hour lecture for both Levels 10 and 11, though each will receive separate tutorials. Prior coming to class, students are expected to have read at least one primary (written or visual) and one secondary source. Students will demonstrate their achievements in the following way: (1) Students are expected to submit a mid-course reflection on materials from previous weeks, comparing and reviewing their salient themes; (2) Students will give presentations (individually or in groups, depending on class size). They will be given a choice of presenting an analysis on either (a) a literary primary source; or (b) a visual source; (3) Students will complete a final essay on any of the topics covered in class.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This interdisciplinary course will enable students to trace and examine the rich and constantly evolving nature of religious thought in Scotland through selected literary texts published from the Romantic period to the late-twentieth century. In order to achieve this, the work of a variety of writers from different religious (and non-religious) perspectives is considered in historical, theological and social contexts. By analysing key critical terms and concepts which inform Scottish literary texts, including plays, poetry, novels, and short stories, students will relate texts to the religious environments which shaped them. In this way, they will gain a fuller and more enriched understanding of the relationship between Scottish literature and religion.Syllabus/Outline Content:This course will begin with consideration of how national literatures are constructed, before moving on to explore selected Scottish texts, religious voices, and literary forms each week in their historical and theological contexts. The course is chronological in structure, and moves through writing reflecting romantic supernaturalism, themes of social and religious change, and Victorian religious pessimism, to twentieth-century reconstructions of Scotland's early religious history and conflict. The course's final weeks reflect the growing religious pluralism and diversity of modern Scotland in selected texts, which nonetheless draw on earlier Scottish literary forms and themes in their exploration of the nation's religious imagination.Student Learning Experience Information:This course has a programme of a weekly lecture and seminar. On the basis of students' preparatory reading of a range of literary texts and other writings, seminars will be used to explore and compare the connections between Scottish authors, poets, and dramatists in their evolving religious and social milieus. Preparation for seminars will also depend on student discussion in advance in autonomous learning groups. These groups will discuss key theological, ethical and religious themes in the texts. Groups will present the findings of their discussions in the forms of written reports on Learn, informal class discussion, and formal presentations in the seminar.The structure for this course is chronological, and though these texts respond to the age in which they are written, many also deal with historical religious conflicts, developments and devotions. As such, students will be encouraged to explore the connections between historical periods, and they will be guided through the examination of concepts such as national literature and religious change. Students will also be offered formative feedback as the course progresses. This will help them to develop the knowledge and analytical skills that will be assessed in the course's assignments.",

Alongside an historical study of the period will be religious topics and themes (eg Temple, the Dead Sea Scrolls, messianism, Pharisees) that are particularly important for students of Biblical Studies.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:The course is a study of ancient Judaism in the Second Temple period, from the end of the Babylonian exile (ca. 515 BCE) to the beginning of the rabbinic period (ca. 200 CE). The overall approach is basically historical, but because of the nature of the extant evidence, a great deal of attention is given to the interpretation of Jewish literary texts from this period. In any given semester, the course may focus either on a particular set of texts (e.g., histories, apocalypses, Greek Jewish texts) or on a particular theme (e.g., temple, law, messianism). The primary focus of the course is the Second Temple Jewish texts themselves, but other relevant ancient texts and also modern critical treatments will be brought in where relevant.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course will focus on one or more Jewish texts from the Second Temple period, including late-biblical books like Ezra, Nehemiah, and Daniel, other apocalypses like the Book of the Watchers, 4 Ezra, and 2 Baruch, novellas like Tobit, Judith, and Joseph and Aseneth, wisdom texts like Ben Sira and Wisdom of Solomon, legal texts like 4QMMT and the Mishnah, histories like 1-2 Maccabees and Josephus's Antiquities, and more. Other ancient sources on Jews and Judaism (e.g., Greek and Roman historians, geographers, satirists, material and documentary remains) will also be consulted where relevant. Select readings from key modern critics will be assigned relative to the particular letter or theme for that semester.Student Learning Experience Information:The course meets once each week for a two-hour block, with a schedule of readings to be carried out before each meeting. The normal pattern will be that, in any given week, one hour is devoted to interactive lecture, the other hour to seminar-style discussion of primary texts. Student numbers permitting, over the course of the semester each student will give one short presentation on one of the texts for his or her assigned day. Through participation in lecture and seminar discussions, as well as through the written work and the examination included in the assessment schedule, students will demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes.",

    "summary": "There are several texts in the Hebrew Bible that trouble the understandings of God and challenge the modern exegete. This God attacks his chosen ones from behind, he demands child sacrifice and genocide, and he inflicts misery and violence on his people. So, how can we conceive of a God who is macho, cruel, ruthless, and even indulges in ethnic cleansing?",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:The Hebrew Bible contains a great number of texts that trouble the conventional Jewish and Christian understandings of God and challenge the reader of the He-brew Bible. This God attacks his chosen ones from behind, he demands child sacrifice and genocide, and he inflicts misery and violence on his people. This course aims to integrate these seemingly incongruous texts in the understanding of the Hebrew Bible, where they are neglected frequently in favour of the idea of a loving and faithful God. A historical critical reading helps to understand the texts as theological expressions in their time and integrates them into an image of God that is not always comprehensive and comfortable.Due to the topic of the course, there are some (textual) depictions of violence that participants might find upsetting.Sample Syllabus/Outline Content:Each week will focus on a set primary text accompanied by two or more secondary readings. The session in week 1 will provide an introductory session, while the last session will consist of a debate that summarises the course content.Student Learning Experience Information:Students will be taught in a weekly mix of seminar and lecture totaling 2 hours. In the lecture session, the course teacher will introduce the biblical texts, combining close readings with interactive elements. The engagement with the biblical texts combines literary readings with a historical-critical approach, aiming to understand the texts as documents from their own times. For the seminar sessions, students are expected to prepare the biblical texts and secondary readings for discussion in class, where they may be asked to e.g. present a text, lead a discussion, pair with a partner, reflect on a piece of art, or discuss the implications of the biblical texts for today's society. Students are assessed on a coursework essay and the end-of-term exam, through which they will demonstrate the achievement of the learning outcomes. A one-to-one 'Learning Conversation' in the middle of term offers the students the opportunity to reflect on their learning experience; on this occasion, they will also be able to receive feedback on their essay plan and their overall participation in class.",

From covid through conspiracies to climate change, the apocalypse - from Greek apok\u00c3\u00a1lypsis, 'revelation' - is repeatedly referenced in contemporary culture. In this interdisciplinary course, we analyse and assess classic and current visions of the apocalypse. Concentrating on European and American contexts, we trace these visions throughout history, inquiring how factual and fictional accounts of the apocalypse shape our understanding of the world we live in today. Throughout, we aim to ask and answer how visions of the apocalypse determine our future by provoking either apathy or action.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:In this interdisciplinary course, we analyse and assess classic and current visions of the apocalypse. Approaching apocalypticism as a social and political imaginary that runs through Euroamerican history, we ask how visions of the end of the world shape contemporary culture. Religion is crucial to these visions. We draw on a variety of disciplines - reaching from natural sciences through the interpretation of film and fiction to cultural studies - to discuss how visions of the apocalypse determine our future. Which apocalyptic visions provoke apathy? Which apocalyptic visions provoke action? And how can we differentiate between them through a politics of envisioning the end of the world? By asking and answering questions like these, the course enables us to identify and interpret the apocalyptic imaginary in contemporary culture, thus showcasing the significance of interdisciplinary reflections on religion for understanding the world we live in today.Outline:Framed by 'Introduction' and 'Conclusion' that cover the emergence and the evolution of the study of apocalypticism in the academy, this course will (1) examine the roots of apocalypticism in classical sources, (2) explore the resonances of apocalypticism in contemporary sources, and (3) evaluate how classic and contemporary apocalypticisms shape our imagination of the future. Throughout, the sources are selected in conversation with the students taking the course.Student Learning Experience:The course is structured around a lecture of one hour that introduces students to the topic of the week. The lecture is complemented by a seminar session of one hour dedicated to the discussion of set texts or themes. These are chosen in conversation with students, showing the variety of visions of the end of the world in the past and the present. The seminar sessions include student presentations of around ten minutes with a view to initiating discussion. In addition to their presentation, students will be assessed by a review essay and a reflective essay. Through these assessments, students will demonstrate the achievement of the learning outcomes of the course.",

Typically there will be a focus on one of the synoptic gospels in order to provide a major in depth analysis of a specific text. At least one lecture will be devoted to the synoptic problem and the relationship of John's Gospel and various non-canonical gospels to the three synoptic gospels.

    "summary": "This course explores, makes sense of, and problematises texts from the Hebrew Bible in light of contemporary issues. Each interpreter is shaped by his/her contemporary context, with its driving assumptions, concerns, and ideologies. With these in mind, students will interpret the Hebrew Bible from perspectives informed by modern views of e.g. gender, socio-economics, disability and ecology. Students will also examine the implications of these types of readings for theology, ethics and praxis.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:Hebrew Bible scholarship is becoming increasingly aware that every interpreter is situated in a context - social, economic, geographical - which inevitably affects their interpretation. Rather than ignoring these contexts, this course brings them to the fore. It draws on the growing literature in biblical studies of 'ideological criticism' and 'situated readings'. Students will analyse and critique hermeneutical stances informed by studies of e.g. gender, race, disability, socio-economics, ecology and animals. Students will apply these methods themselves, to a range of texts from the Hebrew Bible. These texts are first considered in their original contexts, and set against the practices, ideologies, and assumptions of the ancient world. They are then examined through these newer lenses. Students will also explore and reflect on the implications of this interpretation strategy, be they theological, ethical, or practical.Syllabus/Outline Content:The precise content and structure of the course may change in different years; what follows is an indicative breakdown. The course begins by considering how contemporary perspectives may shape our reading of biblical texts. Subsequently, several weeks each focalise a particular issue, e.g. gender, sexuality, ethnicity, class, disability, species, and ecology. Students analyse relevant biblical texts and discuss how these issues are considered in the contemporary and ancient worlds, bringing these perspectives into dialogue. The final weeks of the course broaden out to the implications of this type of reading for theology, ethics, and practice, and consider how biblical texts are used and abused in debates around contemporary justice causes.Student Learning Experience Information:Students are taught in weekly 2-hour sessions. The teaching staff provide some lecture content (either pre-recorded or in class), and the bulk of the class time is devoted to interactive activities. Students may, for example, have a debate, lead a discussion, analyse a text, reflect on a piece of art, discuss with a partner. Through the course, students write a series of short blog posts and a culminating essay to explore their ideas further.",

Using English translations and secondary scholarship it will examine the key characters and plots, and relate them to wider Hindu debates about the nature of gods, the obligations of humans, and the cosmic battle between good and evil.

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course explores the two great Hindu epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Using English retellings and secondary scholarship it will examine the key characters and plots, and relate them to wider developments in Hindu traditions. The two epics are dated, in their classical Sanskrit versions, to around the 4th century BCE to 4th century CE, thus falling in an important period of Hindu development. As the old Vedic culture that dominated the Northwest of India is challenged by the new religious movements of the Northeast - namely Buddhism and Jainism - a new form of Hinduism begins to emerge. Karma and rebirth is incorporated into the ideology, and new paths to liberation become the focus of religious activity, while the dominant teachings continue to emphasise the importance of fulfilling one's worldly duties. Meanwhile, devotional traditions surrounding key deities such as Visnu, start to develop and rise in popularity. The Mahabharata and Ramayana are key contributors to this exciting religious scene, with their teachings about the nature of gods, the obligations of humans, and the cosmic battle between good and evil. Developing into multiple versions in multiple languages, the epics are also a window into the changing religious landscape of India.Syllabus/Outline Content:After an introductory week that introduces key historical and thematic considerations, the course is broadly split into two halves: in the first half of the semester we focus on the Mahabharata, and in the second half on the Ramayana. We will read key episodes from the epics in English translation, and discussion of these will be accompanied by lectures on related themes and questions. The two are tied together at the end of the semester with a discussion of key common features and distinctive elements.Student Learning Experience Information:The course will be delivered through a weekly two-hour class. The first hour will usually be a student-led discussion of the week's readings from the epics, while the second hour will constitute a lecture introducing key themes relevant to the week ahead. Students will be expected to keep up with the primary source readings and to write a short response to the reading each week; this will serve as an opportunity for formative feedback but also constitute 20% of the course mark. Lectures will also point to relevant secondary scholarship, which students will need to seek out. A coursework essay of 2,000 words will form a further 20% of the course grade, and feedback on essay plans will provide formative assessment; this essay will address a question on the Mahabharata. A two-hour end of course examination will count for the remaining 60% of the mark, and will ask students to answer three questions: one on the Mahabharata, one on the Ramayana and one on a point of comparison or contrast between the two epics.",

Students will engage with historical, ethical, methodological, and religious debates surrounding the history and representation of the Holocaust.Syllabus/Outline ContentThe aim of this course is to chart engagements with the Holocaust in a variety of discourses and media, and to give students the opportunity to navigate historical, cultural, and religious studies methods in their analysis. Students will engage with case studies from the 1930s to the present. These will vary each year, and may include photography, film, graphic art, literature, theatre, memorials and museums, as well as religious texts.Student Learning Experience InformationThe course consists of a lecture component and seminar discussion. The lecture component will be taught as a 'flipped classroom', either with an in-person lecture or with lecture materials provided online via Learn. To prepare for the seminar students need to engage with the set primary sources and an appropriate range of secondary readings. During the semester, students will complete 3 short assignments that practice analysis and interpretation of sources. The format of these will vary to engage with different writing and presentation styles. The short assignments are a key part of the formative and summative assessment in this course and directly inform seminar discussion.

    "summary": "This course introduces students to diverse genres of premodern Muslim thought, with an emphasis on cultivating an understanding of Islam in all its diversity as a lived religion. The course title is an homage to the late Shahab Ahmed's What is Islam? The Importance of Being Islamic (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2016), a work whose central inquiry, on the delineation of the category of 'the Islamic', is the reoccurring concern of each individual week. Rather than engaging at length with the various critical-theoretical approaches to the subject (though there are elements of this in the first and final weeks, in extracts from Ahmed are assigned), students will engage with 'Islam' as a category of analysis through their experience of various forms of literary production, with particular attention to the so-called marginal. The emphasis throughout is on the disruption of received wisdoms on the subject. Students should be advised that the course entails the occasional discussion of material that is of a sensitive or explicit nature, including elements of sexuality.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:Shahab Ahmed has seminally argued that 'the Islamic' is best conceptualised as any attempt to seriously engage with what he terms the Text, Con-Text and Pre-Text of Revelation. The 'Text' represents the core teachings of the Islamic religious tradition as embodied in the Qur'an and the voluminous body of reports attributed to the Prophet (hadith or Sunna, more broadly). The 'Con-Text' represents the sum total of previous attempts at interpreting and embodying this material, or such aspects of its as are available to particular Muslim actors in any one context. The 'Pre-Text' constitutes the various interpretive lenses through which 'Text' is read, that is the a priori commitments Muslims bring to the interpretation of these texts, which reading is never innocent of assumptions. This course explores the usefulness of this framing through the reading of a range of literary genres, with an emphasis on typically neglected aspects of this heritage.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course begins and ends with reading from Shahab Ahmed's What is Islam? whose central concerns bookend the assigned readings. We then progress through a series of discrete but interrelated topics, starting with aspects of the numinous and moving on to the earthier, exploring the boundaries of propriety, and finally their enforcement through the suppression of various forms of vice. Students should be advised that the course entails the occasional discussion of material that is of a sensitive or explicit nature, including elements of sexuality.Student Learning Experience Information:There is one two-hour seminar each week. For each seminar, reading is assigned from the secondary literature (usually a broad overview of a particular theme), along with short extracts from two or three primary sources, in translation. These materials form the basis of discussion, with students presenting on individual primary sources in each week. The assessment is comprised of this presentation, a book review and an essay. The course includes some demanding material, but this will be unpacked in the course of teaching, and through classroom discussion. Students should be advised that the course includes content of a sensitive and, occasionally, sexually explicit nature.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:The aim of this interdisciplinary course is to enable students to be able analyse in detail a range of set plays and theatrical revivals, alongside pertinent secondary literature. By carrying out this detailed analysis and focusing on how individual productions portray the search for different kinds of peace (e.g. positive or negative peace), the complex evolving relationship between theatre and religion will be investigated. This course goes beyond the textual analysis of individual plays to consider the ways in which different productions engage in practices of adaptation and re-interpretation.Syllabus/Outline Content:Different kinds of plays and theatrical revivals performed over the last one hundred years will be considered in detail, including: Greek drama (week 1), medieval mysteries (2), morality and passion plays (3-4), early modern (5-7) and modernist dramas (8-10), and contemporary productions (4, 11, etc). The relationship between the original plays and later revivals (as forms of re-interpretation or adaptation) will also be considered.Student Learning Experience Information:The course involves one two-hour seminar per week and one one-hour tutorial in smaller groups. The full class seminar (2hrs) will consist of a combination of interactive lecture-style presentations, brief rehearsed readings of short extracts from the set play, and debates about the play and set texts. The smaller tutorial groups (1hr) will provide the opportunity for students to discuss the weeks set text(s) in detail. Each student will be required to give a short presentation on the text for the day at one tutorial during the semester. Theadditional one-hour small tutorial group has also proved successful in other classes (e.g. Film, Religion and Ethics) and ensures that even less talkative/confident students are able to contribute/participate. There are a number of precedents for a third honours contact hour in New College and beyond, which is vital for the intended pedagogical approach and the creative coverage of primary and secondary texts. (For students from the English department this hour replaces their hour-long Autonomous Learning Group). Through participation in seminars, prepared readings, and tutorial discussions, as well as through the written work and the examination included in the assessment schedule, students will demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:In modern theological and secular ethics, theoretical and issue-based approaches have each made people strangely invisible. In reaction, this course focuses on interpersonal ethics, drawing on the French continental tradition from the mid twentieth century to the present day. This material is highly significant for philosophers, Christian ethicists and Jewish ethicists. Although the course is text-based, students are encouraged to develop their own constructive understanding of interpersonal ethics by reflecting, according to preference, on the philosophical or theological perspectives proposed by the course.Syllabus/Outline Content:After initial orientation the course turns to Emmanuel Levinas, looking at his ethics of the face and his later hostage imagery. The second ethicist studied is Paul Ricoeur, with the key ideas covered being friendship and responsibility. The course then moves on to Jacques Derrida and his notions of gift and hospitality, which are followed by Maurice Merleau-Ponty's theory of embodied ethics. The course concludes with the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer's understanding of guilt, which has interesting affinities with earlier material. Throughout the course, the ideas encountered will be situated in their philosophical and biblical context.Student Learning Experience Information:There is one two-hour seminar each week and the course manager is available for consultation at other times. A key text is to be read before each seminar and forms the basis for the seminar teaching and discussion. Each student gives a presentation on one of these texts. The assessment comprises the presentation and seminar participation, a coursework essay and a written exam. Although the course includes some demanding material, the seminar provides the opportunity for this to be discussed and understood through practical examples.",

The topic may have appeared in a previous or current course, and might be relevant to a student's personal interests, work, faith, ministry or possible future study. The topic should be well focused, such as on a specific thinker, text, group, historical event or location. It is usually easier to broaden a narrow topic than to reduce a big topic. In conjunction with their supervisor, students then formulate a research question or problem related to the chosen topic and use appropriate methods and research sources to address it.Syllabus/Outline Content:The content is determined by the research question or problem. In consultation with their supervisor, students formulate their own work timetable determined by the chapters and headings in their dissertation outline. Suitable primary and secondary academic sources, both printed and electronic, are identified, using existing knowledge, the library catalogue and online research databases. Some projects may use archival sources. Other projects may employ fieldwork methods, such as a site visit, interviews or participant observation. Any research involving human subjects will require prior ethical review, which includes a risk assessment. Students considering fieldwork may wish to prepare for this by taking REST10047 Field-Work Approaches for the Study of Religion in year 3.Student Learning Experience Information:Planning begins in semester 2 of the preceding year with a briefing. In this semester, students must register an agreed topic and potential supervisor, providing a brief description and an initial bibliography. Research and writing commence in semester 1 and continue through semester 2. Three formal meetings are held with the supervisor through the year, with feedback on the same chapter permitted only once. Additional informal consultation may take place in person or by email. No meetings or feedback are allowed within seven days of the submission deadline. The assessment is based entirely on the written dissertation, which must be in the required format and use a recognised citation style.",

The course covers the origins of Buddhism, the development of Therav\u00c3\u00a1da as a distinct branch, the history of Therav\u00c3\u00a1da, and key aspects of Therav\u00c3\u00a1da Buddhist thought and practice. Students are expected to engage directly with primary sources, both textual and ethnographic, and to reflect upon the nature of these types of sources within the academic study of Buddhism.Syllabus/Outline Content:This course begins with the beginnings of Therav\u00c3\u00a1da Buddhism, by exploring Therav\u00c3\u00a1da representations of the life of the Buddha and traditional understandings of Therav\u00c3\u00a1da history and identity. It then discusses key Buddhist ideas in their Therav\u00c3\u00a1da formulations, the notion of scripture and the compilation of the 'P'li canon', monasticism as the basic Therav\u00c3\u00a1da institution, meditation, ethics, ritual and devotional practices, and the role of Therav\u00c3\u00a1da Buddhism in national identity and political debate. Throughout the course students are encouraged to explore variations in Therav\u00c3\u00a1da perspectives, as well as to question both traditional and academic representations of Therav\u00c3\u00a1da Buddhism.Student Learning Experience Information:The course has a two-hour class per week. The first hour is usually a traditional lecture format, albeit with interactive elements and an emphasis on student engagement with primary sources, whether in the form of text, film, image or sound. The second hour is a seminar discussion of the set reading for the week, which is provided in a course reader and consists of a mixture of scriptural extracts and ethnographic accounts. Students are expected to read the set seminar readings and produce a weekly short written response that gives a brief summary of the source, picks out one or two points of interest and raises a question for discussion. Students are also expected to follow up recommended readings relating to lecture themes. For essay 1 students must choose a primary text extract to research and write about, while essay 2 allows the students to study a key theme or question relating to Therav\u00c3\u00a1da belief or practice in depth.

    "course_description": "This course explores the interplay of politics, philosophy, ritual and cosmology in the legitimation and administration of state power. We trace the origins of the statutory state (lu ling, ritsury\u00c2\u00bf) in Sui and Tang China, and its adoption first on the Korean peninsula and then in the early Japanese state (Nara and Heian periods, viz. eighth and ninth centuries). The changes brought about in early ninth-century Japan by the activities of two monks in particular, Saicho (767-822) and Kukai (774-835) will be treated in some detail, as they provide, through contrasting interaction with ritsuryo norms, intriguing illustrations of the role of  ideology and cosmology in government.In the background are the standards of government exemplified by Tang China and the relations developed and nurtured by the prominent sovereign states of East Asia. An analysis of the religio-political implications of Saicho's petitions for adoption of the Mahayana precepts and of Kukai's introduction of Esoteric Buddhism will give students a focal point for understanding the importance of cosmology and ontology in the religio-political matrix.The course begins with an examination of the political aspects of the eastward spread of Buddhism and the integration of Buddhism into the Tang state. Attention is also given to the place of translating the Buddhist scriptures into Chinese (Xuan Zang) and the technology of Esoteric Buddhism (Amoghavajra); Japanese embassies to China and the Chinese influence on the first Japanese state; and a detailed consideration of the eighth-century Japanese capital Nara, which in turn entails an analysis of the state, its cosmology, its Buddhism and its material culture. The careers and writings of Saicho and Kukai from the late eighth century are looked at in detail, including Saicho's Mahayana precepts and his debates with the Nara establishment, and Kukai's rise to political and religious prominence, especially his expansive writings on cosmos and the state. The course will also provide opportunity for summative reflections on Buddhism and the polity in comparative perspective.",

    "course_description": "Many cults of Greek and Roman antiquity, including some of the most prominent ones, were based on personal initiation. Often this would entail an obligation to keep the cult's core ideas and rituals secret; in some cases, passing them on to non-initiates was punishable by death. For modern scholars, this veil of secrecy creates obvious problems: while many ancient authors offered their own speculations on what was going on in these cults, it is often unclear how they (and hence: we) could possibly know. For some prominent cults, we encounter wild ideas and baseless polemics, whereas for others, we hardly get any information at all. This course offers an in-depth look into what can legitimately be said about ancient mystery cults. Combining literary, archaeological and epigraphical evidence ranging from Classical Athens to Roman East Lothian, students embark on a mission to reconstruct an important aspect of ancient religious life. They learn how to apply (and question) theoretical models of religion, and how to use various forms of evidence to imagine the religious experience of ancient individuals.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course examines the wisdom literature of the Hebrew Bible in its ancient West Asian context. It taps into the wisdom of the ages to explore issues which perennially face humankind. Scholarship in this area has flourished recently, as old assumptions are questioned and new issues brought into focus. Does the book of Proverbs suppose that good deeds always have good consequences? Does the book of Job offer a viable solution to the problem of innocent suffering? Does the book of Ecclesiastes find any meaning in life? And can modern perspectives shed any new light on these ancient texts and problems?Syllable/Outline Content:A typical course outline might run as follows: After an introduction to wisdom literature, the course examines the major biblical wisdom books, each contextualised amongst other ancient literature. First, it explores the book of Proverbs, with its apparent 'act-consequence' connection and divinely run world order.  Using a feminist hermeneutic, it examines Proverbs' polarised depictions of 'Lady Wisdom' and 'Lady Folly'. Next, it probes into the problem of innocent suffering in the book of Job, along with related questions about the character of God and motives for human piety. It uses disability studies to examine Job's physical body, and ecological hermeneutics to explore depictions of the nonhuman world. Finally, it examines the book of Ecclesiastes, which ruminates on the meaninglessness of life, and yet the ongoing possibility of pleasure. Ecclesiastes emphasises human frailty and ignorance in the grand sweep of cosmic time, while critiquing the unjust accumulation of wealth.Student Learning Experience Information:Students have weekly 2-hour seminars with UG students and addition weekly 1-hour seminars for PGs only. The teaching staff provide some lecture content (either pre-recorded or in class), and most of the class time is devoted to interactive activities. Students may, for example, have a debate, lead a discussion, analyse a text, reflect on a piece of art, discuss with a partner. Students compile an assessed annotated bibliography to better understand the scholarly field. This will then serve as a helpful resource for the final essay, in which students will sythesise their learning, and put forward their own proposals.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:The New Testament Book of Revelation has exerted an exceptional theological and cultural influence. The proposed course will provide students with the chance to study this important text in its historical context, but also to explore its later reception in theology, art, politics and film.

We will then draw on reception studies to explore some of the many ways Revelation has been interpreted in later theology, politics, and culture.Outline Content:The course will begin by locating Revelation in its ancient historical and literary context, emphasising the significance of the Jewish experience under Roman imperialism, the Jewish War with Rome, and the destruction of the Jerusalem temple, as well as the diverse nature of Jesus-following groups in the first century and their relationships with (other) Jews. We will address questions of genre and rhetoric, considering different approaches to reading and interpreting this enigmatic text. Our study will include close readings of particular passages, employing historical-critical, postcolonial, feminist and other hermeneutical approaches.

This course will socially and historically contextualize a variety of positions in interaction with established academic theories of religion, providing a theoretically and methodologically rich critical introduction to a variety of controversial 'religion-related' ideologies, arguments, groups, movements and identifications.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:The aim of the course is to introduce students to a range of 'religion-related' formations - atheistic, humanistic, 'non-religious' - in modern societies, in a historical and sociological context. The focus is to examine formations which (positively) propagate 'post-religious' identities and also which (negatively) resist 'religion'. It will also examine the various theoretical and methodological issues involved in the study of atheism and the rejection of 'religion', and consider these formations in relation to the broader academic study of religion/s.Syllabus and Outline Content:We begin with an overview of the course and a discussion of the state of play in the contemporary study of 'atheism', 'humanism', 'non-religion' and related formations, and discuss the grounds of their inclusion within the comparative study of religion/s. We will then trace the etymology of 'Atheism' through the pejorative ancient Greek 'atheos' to the political assignment of the Latin 'atheismus' to the beliefs and practices of the early Christians. We continue this historical progression through the periods of the Renaissance, Reformation and Enlightenment, looking at the content, context and some key exponents of major scientific and social critiques of 'religion' in the West, up to the 'New Atheism' of the early twenty-first century. Our attention then turns to non-Western contexts, paying particular attention to the Marxist-Leninist scientific atheism of the former-USSR and to post-colonial rationalist skepticism in India. Finally, we fully embrace a more sociological and ethnographic approach and look at contemporary 'humanist' and 'non-religious' formations, the problematic entanglements of this whole field with issues of gender, race and ethnicity, and the genesis, conceptualizations and uses of the notion of 'religious indifference'.Student Learning Experience Information:The course has a one hour lecture plus a one hour seminar per week. Lectures are based around presentations from the lecturer and include some audio-visual content. Background readings are set for each week's topics. Seminars are student-led discussions of set readings based on a full bibliography built into the syllabus, and involving student presentations.Students will demonstrate their completion of the intended learning outcomes through a combination of lecture and seminar activities, by the preparation of a presentation, a guided essay and a main essay. Summative assessment will be through the presentation and essays. Formative assessment will include oral feedback on contributions to class discussion and written and/or oral feedback on the essays and the main essay plan. The combination of seminar presentation, guided essay and extended essay is designed to achieve a whole course coverage across different genres of assessment.",

Themes covered include eco-Buddhism, gender & sexuality (women/transgender/nonbinary), animal ethics, abortion, euthanasia, economic ethics, and issues related to Buddhism and violence, war, and peace. It is both an analysis of ethical issues from a Buddhist perspective and includes critical responses to Buddhist ethical ideas.  The course is a rigorous engagement with Buddhist ethical practices with both an historical overview and an engagement with Buddhist ethics.Syllabus/Outline Content:The foundations of Buddhist ethics will be covered including karma, rebirth, the Buddhist precepts, and notions of compassion and loving-kindness. These will be used to explore a wide range of Buddhist ethical ideas including eco-Buddhism, gender & sexuality (women/transgender/nonbinary), animal ethics, abortion, euthanasia, economic ethics, and issues related to Buddhism and violence, war, and peace, racial ethics, race-based identity, whiteness.It aims to cover a spectrum of Buddhist behavior offering a perspective on how Buddhists understand wholesome and unwholesome behavior, and how their ideas evaluate classical and contemporary ethical issues.Student Learning ExperienceThe course will be delivered alongside a level 10 (upper undergraduate) course. PG students will share the weekly two-hour class in addition to fortnightly seminars as a PGT cohort. One hour will usually be a discussion, led by the lecturer, of key themes, concepts and contextual information that will enable full comprehension of the following week\u00c2\u00bfs readings. The other hour of the joint class will normally be student-led discussion of readings from articles, book chapters and primary texts (in translation). Students should expect to read a substantial piece of scholarship each week in preparation for class. In addition, PG students will have a fortnightly advanced seminar to discuss contextual and theoretical readings.Four short close analysis pieces are due during the semester, while the main essay, which will require students to draw on several of the readings in order to address an issue in Buddhist ethics is due at the end of the course. Formative feedback will be provided on the close analysis pieces and essay plans, and the final class of the semester will be given over to discussion of thematic links and plans for the final essay.",

    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionMonasticism is considered crucial for the survival of Buddhism. This course aims to explore the origin, evolution, and function of Buddhist monasticism. Throughout the course, we will collectively reflect over some significant questions such as: - How monasticism is defined in different Buddhist traditions. Why people willingly choose monastic life that involves significant changes in clothing, eating habits, daily routine, etc. while strictly following vows, rules and precepts. How Buddhist monasticism has transformed overthe long span of Buddhist history, and what circumstances led to these changes. How the Buddhist monastic institution interacts or negotiates its relationship with political powers and other historical and social processes. How the institution of Buddhist nuns or female monastics continue in China while disappearing in other parts of Asia. What we can learn from the regiment of monastic life and the literary and artistic creations of Buddhist monks and nuns about how to live our life. We will be discussing how a disciplined life and living in a community can enable ethical transformations. Although some of the earliest Buddhist texts advocated strict celibacy, most of the Buddhist communities in subsequent centuries adopted a form of monasticism and priesthood that allowed for families. We will explore the social changes, ethical and philosophical ideas that led to the acceptance of families in Buddhist monasticism. Additionally, we will examine how monasticism, with or without celibacy, influences the ethical development of individuals who choose one or the other form of life.Outline ContentThe course will begin with an exploration of the concept of 'monasticism' within the sphere of religion and religious studies. During the initial week, we will also delve into the theoretical and methodological approaches that are employed in studying, interpreting, and explaining monasticism more broadly. Subsequently, from the second week onwards, our attention will be directed towards the evolution of the Buddhist monastic establishment, commencing with its nascent formation and dissemination across various Asian countries. Each week will be devoted to investigating specific themes or geographic locations in further detail.Student Learning ExperienceEach class will consist of a lecture followed by discussion. During lecture the instructor will provide an overview of the historical context and technical concepts highlighted in the readings. The rest of the class will be devoted to in-depth discussions among students, where they can share their personal insights and perspectives on the readings. Active participation in classroom discussions is essential for maximizing the learning experience.",

Taking a comparative approach, the course explores the mind-set of English-speaking Calvinists, mediated to each other through print, personal contact, and similar styles of piety.  The aim will be to identify tensions within their confessional tradition, and to understand the diverse contexts in which Calvinist theology and piety took root.Syllabus/Outline Content:After a seminar to introduce recent scholarship and the seventeenth century context, the course explores key themes: 'godly learning' and the practice of piety, Providence and providentialism, covenant theology, the challenge of Arminianism, the role of religion in emigration to New England, contemporary debates over conversion and assurance, Reformed theology and visual culture, sacraments and the sabbath. The final seminars focus on the Westminster Assembly's efforts to achieve reform (which brought together the experience of England, Scotland, and New England), and on the explosion of radical religious activity in England in the 1640s and 1650s. Primary texts, including rare books from New College Library, are central to the course.Student Learning Experience Information:The course has eleven two-hour seminars, one each week.  From the second week, the first hour of each class is devoted to discussion based on the previous week's work (centred on primary texts).  The second hour comprises more formal teaching to introduce the following week's theme.  Students must lead one or more discussion sessions, by posting a blog ahead of the class and leading the discussion on the day.  All students are expected to contribute to the blog and seminar discussion: this involves reading 17th century texts, most of which are in New College Library but are also available via Early English Books Online.  Through participation in the schedule of readings, class discussion, and a written assignment based on a 17th century text (chosen in consultation with the course manager), students will demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes.",

The focus is on understanding and evaluating how recent and current contributions to Christian ethics draw on Christian scripture and tradition, on the experience of Christian communities, and on different academic disciplines and approaches, to address specific contemporary ethical challenges. Topics to be covered may include the climate crisis; poverty and economic inequality; truth and lies in an age of fake news; misogyny and gender-based violence; and the treatment of non-human animals. Alongside these topics, we will explore fundamental questions about the project of Christian ethics. Why and on what basis can we talk about a distinctive 'Christian ethics'? What methods and sources are appropriate for Christian ethics? And what should be the response when Christian theology itself stands accused of being 'unethical'?Syllabus/Outline Content:The first, shorter, part of the course will focus on approaches to Christian ethics - what ethics is, how it relates to Christian theology, whether and why it makes sense to talk about a distinctively Christian ethics, and how Christian communities arrive at ethical positions. The second part will apply and develop these ideas through in-depth consideration of Christian approaches to contemporary ethical challenges. Topics to be considered may include, but are not limited to: the climate crisis; poverty and economic inequality; truth, lies and 'fake news'; treatment of non-human animals; misogyny and gender-based violence; ethics in finance.Student Learning Experience Information:The course is taught through the following: private study of set texts and secondary reading; lectures introducing texts and topics; interactive seminars for discussion of texts and topics, requiring specified advance preparation; use of online discussion boards; essay writing on set texts and themes arising from them.Online discussion boards will serve as a starting point for discussion in the seminars. There is no formal assessment of presentation or oral skills, but nonetheless these skills are developed through facilitating and engagement in debate in the seminars.The mid-semester assessment (1000 words, 20%) will take the form of a short 'encyclopaedia entry' on a topic in Christian ethics; suggestions for the topic will be provided, although students may select their own in consultation with the course organiser.

    "summary": "The course explores some of the major themes in the history of Christianity in Africa since the early nineteenth century. Attention is paid to the roles played by African missionaries and indigenous leaders as well as those of European missionaries. Major emphasis is placed on the study and detailed interpretation of key primary sources.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:The course explores how far the growth of Christianity in modern Africa is explicable in terms of the colonial impact. Until the 1960s most scholars had no doubt that it was: the role of mission education in attracting Africans to the white man's religion was undeniable. Since decolonisation, however, the rate of expansion of Christianity has accelerated, putting in question monolithic explanations of the relationship between colonialism and African conversion. This course aims to get beyond the rhetoric, whether colonial or postcolonial, and, on the basis of intensive examination of primary texts, encourages students to form their own judgments about the parts played by African Christians and European missionaries in the story of African Christianity since 1800.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course begins with the largely negative view of Africa taken at the World Missionary Conference in 1910. It then explores the ways in which both missionaries and leading African Christians in the 19th century approached the complex relationship between 'Christianity, commerce, and civilization'. Particular attention is given to Christian competition with Islam, the impact of colonial rivalries on Christianity in Uganda, the emergence of prophet movements and independent churches, the Christian contribution to nationalism and decolonisation, the problematic role played by the churches in Rwanda, and explanations of the growth of Pentecostalism.Student Learning Experience Information:This course gives Level 11 students an opportunity to supplement attendance at the lectures for the Level 10 course Evangelism and Empire: (ECHS10016) with a separate Level 11 seminar devoted to the analysis and interpretation of key primary sources. Students will select a small archive collection for which to complete a primary sources methodological assessment, with guidance from the New College Archivist. Students are encouraged to select an essay topic related to their presentation, though this is not essential.",

    "summary": "This course examines the historical and contemporary relationship between Christian movements and politics in Latin America. Special attention is given to the political implications of religious revivals, the changing forms of church-state relations, the forms of Christian activism that emerged in the continent, and the construction of civil society since 1800.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:The politicisation of religion in Latin America has attracted a good deal of scholarly and public attention in recent decades. At least since the 1970s the evangelical eruption into state politics and the activism of progressive Catholics have demonstrated the public vigour of movements of religious renewal. The projection of religious energies in the continent's public sphere, however, has longer historical roots, and it is the goal of this course to examine the dynamic relationship between Christianity and politics in Latin America over the past two centuries. Students will evaluate the political significance of religious practices and mobilisations and how Christian actors and organisations navigated turbulent processes of socio-political change. The course considers the shifting involvements between churches and the state, their role in the construction of civil society, the Christian forms of grassroots activism, and the churches' ideological discourses. Lectures and seminars will analyse the sweeping religious transformations reframing the political contours of the continent by looking at an array of case studies.Outline Content:The course will be divided in four main units: 1) The session 'Catholics and Protestants in the Emerging Nation States' concentrates on the transformations experienced by the Catholic Church under the new independent nations, especially the rise of Romanised Catholicism, and the earliest wave of evangelical expansion between 1800-1930. Case studies will be taken from Guatemala, Brazil, and Chile. 2) The next unit on 'Religious Conflict and Rebellion' examines church-state conflicts and grassroots messianic movements in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Case studies: the Canudos War in Brazil (1895-8) and the Cristero Rebellion in Mexico (1926-9). 3) The session 'Christian Political Thought and Action Before Liberation Theology' explores the local embodiments of the transnational movement Catholic Action and the implications of Protestant ecumenism in Peru, Mexico, and Brazil. 4) The final block on 'Authoritarian Rule and Democracy Since 1960' turns to contemporary issues, examining the ambiguous relationship of the Catholic Church with the repressive military regimes of the southern cone and evangelical politics.Student Learning Experience:Each weekly session will start with a one-hour lecture followed by a student presentation and a seminar discussion. There will be a list of essential and recommended readings for each week and students are expected to read the texts before lectures, so they can take part in the seminar discussions. Readings set for each week will combine primary historical sources and specialised secondary literature.",

Another consistent focus will be the relationship of Christianity to the majority religious traditions.Syllabus/Outline Content:This course surveys the varied fortunes of Christianity in Asia since 1700, paying particular attention to India and China, but also exploring other regions of South, East, and Southeast Asia. Some of the themes that will be covered include debates around ecumenism and independency in India and China, aspirations towards social and religious harmony in Singapore and Malaysia, and the role of Christianity in nation-building in Indonesia and Korea. Throughout the course, issues of defining the identity of Christians within their Asian contexts will be central.Student Learning Experience Information:Each week comprises a two-hour class which combines formal lecture input and interactive discussion on the basis of key primary texts set for each week.

    "summary": "Having adopted Christianity from Constantinople (988), Prince Volodymyr made not only a religious but also a geopolitical choice. Yet for centuries Ukraine has been a home not only to the Eastern Orthodox, but also to Catholics, Greek Catholics, and Protestants, as well as to non-Christians, primarily Jews and Muslims. The course offers a more than a thousand-year long overview of the Christian presence in Ukraine, focusing on a link between religion and politics from the introduction of Christianity in Rus\u00c2\u00bf (988) until current Russo-Ukrainian war.",
    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionThe course discusses more than a thousand-year-long history of Christianity in Ukraine, starting with the baptism of Rus\u00c2\u00bf (988) under Prince Volodymyr and continuing up to the current Russo-Ukrainian war, in which Russia makes historical claims to the medieval state of Rus\u00c2\u00bf and thus to Ukrainian territories at large.Outline ContentHaving adopted Christianity from Constantinople, Rus\u00c2\u00bf entered the Byzantine world and defined Eastern Orthodoxy as a default religious choice for the majority of Christians who lived in these territories. Yet there were plentiful links to Western Christianity, especially during the time when Ukrainian territories belonged to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The case in point is the emergence of the largest Eastern Catholic Church, known now as the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, at the Union of Brest (1596). The course also analyses differences in the imperial policies towards various Christian denominations, as they were employed in the Catholic Habsburg Empire and the Orthodox Russian Empire. The Ukrainian territories were ruled by the Habsburgs and Romanovs between the partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the late eighteenth century and the fall of both empires at the end of the First World War. Close attention is paid to the Soviet religious policy in Ukraine in relation to the Orthodox, Greek Catholics, Roman Catholics, and different Protestant groups. Finally, the course looks at the surge of different Christian denominations in the early 1990s, after Ukraine gained its independence in 1991. A significant focus is put on the role of religion in the Maidans and in the current Russo-Ukrainian war.Student Learning ExperienceThe course combines lectures and seminars. For seminar discussions, the students will be generally assigned readings from primary sources and secondary literature. Additionally, the students will be asked to deliver one oral presentation and write one research essay during the semester. The tentative list of essay topics will be provided by a lecturer.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This is a core course for the MSc in Science and Religion, but is available to other postgraduate students interested in contemporary issues in the Science-Religion dialogue. The course explores contemporary areas of dialogue and debate between Science and Religion.

The aim is to foster an in-depth understanding of the role of religious belief in modern scientific practice and the challenge of science to religious orthodoxies.Syllabus/Outline Content:No specialised prior knowledge of either science or theology is assumed. Quantum mechanics, relativity, cosmology, evolutionary biology, neuroscience, the problem of evil, the theology of creation and providence - all of these will form the backdrop to this exploration of one of the most far-reaching intellectual debates of modern times.Much of the course will be taken up with in-depth study of scientific and theological thinking on the idea of 'reality'. This involves understanding the different accounts of the beginnings of the universe and of life, especially Big Bang cosmology and biological evolution, and of how they can be appropriated within religious understandings of the physical world. Since much of the debate has taken place within the Western world, many of the religious issues concern the specific claims and doctrines of Christianity, but other world religions will also feature as appropriate. Other relevant contemporary areas of research will also be explored, especially in the neurosciences, current research on the soul/mind problem, and the end of the universe/eschatology.Student Learning Experience Information:The course is taught by means of eleven classes, each of which includes core content presented by one of the course teachers, a student presentation, and opportunity for class discussion. Except for the very first class, each class will require a schedule of reading to be carried out in advance. Students are expected to engage critically with the reading, and to contribute to class discussion. Assessment will be by means of an oral presentation on a relevant topic (20%), and an essay (80%), which will demonstrate that the learning outcomes have been achieved.",

It considers Catholic engagement with modernity, as expressed at Vatican II.  At every stage the course takes account of the role of particular individuals and particular contexts in the unfolding and resolution of controversy.OutlineThe course applies historical approaches to religious beliefs and theological thought, with a strong emphasis on skills for assessing historical and theological evidence. The specific topics to be explored are: the Creed before Nicaea; the Creed from Nicaea to Constantinople; the making of Chalcedonian Christology; medieval disputes over Church, Scripture and Authority; the theological debates that catalysed the Protestant Reformation; the characteristics of the Catholic Reformation and Catholic mysticism; the Biblical Challenge - the development and impact of biblical criticism, c.1650-1900; the Social Challenge - religion and industrialisation; the Darwin controversies; the Confessing Church movement in Nazi Germany; Vatican II and Catholic engagement with modernity.Student Learning ExperienceThe emphasis of the course is both on the development of the major doctrines of Christianity and on the mechanisms for agreeing and disputing them. Students from other programmes with an emphasis on theology or history who are interested in these topics are very welcome to take this course with the consent of their programme directors. Assuming the necessary support from the  University IT infrastructure, the aim is to make the class accessible to students on- and off-campus, using hybrid learning. The class will meet weekly for a two-hour seminar. The first part will usually be led by the course lecturer and then a student (or students) will introduce key seminar readings to start an in-depth discussion. An essential element of the course will be student interaction via a blog in advance of each seminar.  In a week when a student introduces the seminar text(s), they are required to post a 500-word blog of their findings in advance; all students should then add a comment of up to 100 words from their own reading. One of the longer blog-posts will be assessed for 10% of the final mark.  Students write a 3000-word essay on a topic relevant to the course as agreed with the course lecturer: this counts for 90% of the final mark. It is important that students keep up not only with reading the specified text(s) for each seminar, but also with background reading, if they are to attain the depth of knowledge proper to Masters study.  Through participation in the seminars (with associated blogs), and through the essay project, students will demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:A study of major phases in theological debate and clarification, in Western and Eastern Christianity, from the Patristic period to the late Middle Ages. We look at the origins and theological and historical significance of texts such as the Nicene (325) and Constantinopolitan (381) Creeds, the Chalcedonian Definition (451), selected canons of medieval church councils, and some key Christian thinkers. We analyse key factors - philosophical, cultural, hermeneutical, theological, political, personal, linguistic, devotional - in theological disputes such as the Arian and Iconoclastic controversies, and in medieval debate about the Eucharist, authority in the Church, and the nature of salvation. We consider the role of particular individuals in the unfolding and resolution of controversy.Syllabus/Outline Content:Early creedal narratives and the Rule of Truth; Justin, Origen and the development of Logos theology; Constantine; Nicaea and Constantinople I; Nestorius and Cyril; Chalcedon and Constantinople II; Iconoclasm; Hildegard of Bingen; Lateran IV; the Council of Constance; Late medieval disputes over justification and Lateran V.Student Learning Experience Information:This is the first of two core courses for the Theology in History Masters programme, and so the emphasis is on the development both of the major doctrines of pre-Reformation Christianity, and of the mechanisms for agreeing and disputing them. Students from other programmes with an emphasis on theology or history who are interested in these topics are very welcome to take this course with the consent of their programme directors. The class will meet weekly for a two-hour seminar, which will focus on in-depth, contextualised discussion of the text or texts for the week, together with the indicated background reading. All students will be required to post one commentary online in advance of the seminar, and also to write an essay on a topic relevant to the course as agreed with the course lecturer. It is essential that students keep up not only with reading the specified core text(s) every week, but also with background reading, if they are to attain the depth of knowledge proper to Masters study.",

Attention is then paid to the idea of the missio Dei, debates over the meaning and scope of mission, religious pluralism, inculturation, and controversies over proselytism and conversion. Later sessions of the course examine a number of key issues, including the impact of postmodernity, mission and justice, and mission and the created order.Student Learning Experience:Each week comprises a two-hour class which combines formal lecture input, (normally) a student presentation, and interactive discussion on the basis of key primary texts set for each week.  Each student selects one week of the course to make a 15-minute presentation focussed on the texts for that week.

The supervisor will guide the research process by suggesting appropriate literature, advising on shaping the research material into an argument suitable for a 15,000-word dissertation, and accompany the writing process by commenting on drafts and the academic presentation of the material, including the style of references and bibliography.Student Learning Experience Information:This is a course based on independent research. Students are expected to take charge of their work schedule and independently structure their time for research and writing. Regular consultations with their assigned supervisor are essential for the successful completion of the dissertation. Students are encouraged to seek the advice of the supervisor at the beginning of the course and agree a schedule of meetings which allows for the timely completion of the dissertation.",

It offers students an opportunity to engage with a particular topic in the Science-Religion field in depth through their own personal research, culminating in a 15,000 word dissertation. In this, students are encouraged to pursue their own distinctive interests, perhaps making use of their academic backgrounds prior to embarking on the MSc, and/or exploring an issue of interest that has arisen in the taught components of the MSc. Either way, the exercise of researching and writing the dissertation is a key learning outcome of the whole MSc programme, whether the students are going on to further research, teaching, or another area altogether.Syllabus/Outline Content:The content of this course will fall broadly within the Science and Religion field. Approval for the specific content will have been gained by the student successfully proposing their project in the course, Approaches to Research: Science and Religion. The project will be carried out in collaboration with a suitable supervisor, who will advise the student on relevant literature, and the direction of research.Student Learning Experience Information:There are no classes or taught components to this course, and students are expected to structure their own research and writing, in collaboration with their supervisor. Students are encouraged to keep in regular contact with their supervisor, and to submit drafts of the dissertation for comment and advice in good time before the final deadline. A schedule of work and meetings should be drawn up with the supervisor at the commencement of research.",

Students will engage with a number of human rights and feminist debates, and how they have been placed in a critical conversation with the Islamic intellectual tradition.Content:In terms of format, the course will be divided roughly between social history and textual hermeneutics. The first half of the course will seek to gender Muslim history, unearthing the realities, roles, and contributions of women and queer people in different 'moments' in Muslim pasts, in particular the formative period. The second half will pivot to hermeneutical method, exploring the creative ways in which female and queer theologians have reread key Islamic texts - including the Qur'an, hadith (prophetic traditions), Islamic law, and liturgical norms - in order to produce more gender inclusiveand egalitarian spaces through an Islamic discursive framework. Throughout the course, broader ethical issues will be thematically engaged from a feminist perspective, including (but not limited to) ontological equality, leadership, religious authority, sexual pleasure and fulfilment, reproductive rights, and bodily well-being / harm.Student Learning Experience:Engagement with primary source material in translation - in particular the Qur'an and early Islamic texts - is a central part of the learning journey, supplemented by secondary source readings. The weekly lecture will provide a broader framing and contextualisation of the weekly topic, and the tutorials will be devoted to discussing the themes, debates, and engrained assumptions within the assigned texts. A distinctive feature of the PG tutorial is gaining familiarity with emergent scholarly debates and points of contention within the secondary source literature, and the research essay should be in some sort of conversation with these debates.",

Students will engage with a number of human rights and feminist debates, and how they have been placed in a critical conversation with the Islamic intellectual tradition.Content:Islamic feminist theology is the most sophisticated genre within the broader field of Islamic liberation theology, that is, interpretive approaches to Islamic texts are committed to social justice and inclusion. This course explores the complex relationship between Islam and gender, focusing on the creative ways in which Muslim feminist scholars - women, men, and non-binary - have attempted to reread scripture and tradition with an eye to gender equality and social inclusion. The course will begin by focusing on the Qur'an, as the foundational text of the Muslim faith, and its tafsir (interpretation). It will then engage the wider Islamic tradition, including hadith (prophetic reports), sunnah (prophetic custom), shari'a (Islamic law), and liturgy. In addition to addressing issues directly related to Muslim women, from ontological equality and patriarchal representations of the divine to religious authority, leadership, economic in/dependence, and bodily well-being and harm, we will explore queer readings of Islamic texts and the emergent field of Muslim masculinities. Throughout the course, students, will be encouraged to think critically and comparatively, connecting the various themes, thinkers, interpretive methods, and shared (?) contexts and lived experiences.Student Learning Experience:Engagement with primary source material in translation - in particular the Qur'an and early Islamic texts - is a central part of the learning journey, supplemented by secondary source readings.

This course brings together students and scholars of public and political theology from a variety of contexts, countries and continents to tackle one global concern each year.

In a global conversation students learn to analyse and assess how theology impacts public or political debates and how public or political debates impact theology.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course brings together students and scholars of public and political theology from a variety of contexts, countries and continents to tackle one global concern each year. Through lectures delivered by theologians from the Global South as well as the Global North, the course tackles a concern that has stirred up controversy across the globe. Thus, the course encourages critical analyses and constructive assessments of the role of theology in the public square from local and global perspectives. Drawing on experiences and expertise developed by theologians across the globe, students are enabled to evaluate and engage with public and political theology from local and global perspectives.Syllabus/Outline Content:This course revolves around an interactive lecture, delivered by a new scholar each week. Thus, the course showcases the methodological and thematical variety in public and political theology that exists across the globe throughout the semester. Framed by 'Introduction' and 'Conclusion' as well as at least one session dedicated to conversations among scholars and students, the course covers the global concern from conceptual and contextual angles.Student Learning Experience:This course is structured around an interactive lecture of one hour that introduces students to the topic of the week. The lecture - held by a new scholar each week - encourages conversations among students and scholars from a variety of backgrounds. The texts that are read in preparation for the lecture are selected to show the spectrum of approaches to public and political theology across the globe. The precise set-up of the course, including the speakers as well as the required and recommended readings, depends on the global concern chosen for study, so is likely to change from year to year.Students will be assessed by two essays: a review essay of 1000 words, covering a publication in public or political theology and a reflective essay of 4000 words, covering a problem in public or political theology related to the global concern tackled in the course. Through these assessments, students will demonstrate the achievement of the learning outcomes of the course.",

It will challenge the homogenised 'world religions' model using anthropological methods in understanding religions, and highlight the significance of perspectives using ethnographic, textual, theoretical, and visual sources.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course aims to enrich students' engagement with Hindu traditions in South Asia by using visual and textual materials.  Visual materials such as documentary and film will be used to illustrate the diversity of Hindu traditions.  Complementing the visual element will be readings dealing with empirical case studies that enable how traditions are negotiated on the ground and its value for broader comparative and theoretical discussions.  One of the important aspects of this course is to look at understudied aspects of South Asia, particularly its tribal and indigenous communities and their engagement with Hindu and other traditions.  These debates will be carefully considered both in the lectures and the seminar discussions based on visual and textual material that are both empirically rich and theoretically innovative.Syllabus/Outline Content:The complexity and richness of the course will be illustrated through thematic considerations such as deities, caste, gender, karma, dharma, fundamentalism, pilgrimage, gurus, and 'tribes'.  It will utilise key anthropological and historical texts that examine the richness of the region, while using video documentaries and film to illustrate and visually aid how Hindu traditions negotiate the different social/religious/political boundaries.Student Learning Experience Information:The course has a programme of two-hour weekly meetings consisting of one-hour weekly lectures, and one-hour seminar discussions.  This will be complemented by five separate hour-each PG seminars, where more in-depth and advanced discussions will be held. Each student will do a presentation based on the assigned reading and will be responsible for leading class discussion during the seminar hour.  Students are also required to write a weekly-assessed blog that will demonstrate their understanding and engagement with the readings.

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course aims to provide a broad and interdisciplinary overview of some of the most salient developments in the history of the relations between science and religion. Beginning with the amalgamation of Greek philosophy of nature into Christian thought by the Early Fathers, the course proceeds chronologically to ensure a good historical understanding of the development of Western science and its relationship with contemporary theology. The course continues to the present day, with a consideration inter alia of the new atheism and of the theological implications of the human genome project and the possibilities it raises for human biology. Although necessarily selective in its coverage, the range of topics is intended to reflect the major periods in the history of science, and those points where there is most to learn about relations between scientific thinking and Christian theology.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course is team taught, drawing upon scholars from science, history and theology. The syllabus examines interpretations of Genesis in the early church, before moving through the middle ages and the early modern period. Leading scientists such as Newton and Darwin are discussed, while attention is given to the interactions of science and religion in literature.A typical outline of the topics covered is as follows:Week 1: Introduction: The Relationship of Science to TheologyWeek 2: The Early Church Fathers and the Natural WorldWeek 3: St Thomas AquinasWeek 4: Copernicanism and the ChurchesWeek 5: Newton and NewtonianismWeek 6: Ren\u00c3\u00a9 DescartesWeek 7: Immanuel KantWeek 8: The Rise of Natural TheologyWeek 9: Evolution and the 'Grander View of the Creator'Week 10: Science and Religion in PoetryWeek 11: Science and the New AtheismStudent Learning Experience Information:The course is taught by means of eleven sessions, each of which includes core online lecture content presented by one of the course teachers, and opportunity for online class discussion. Each session will require a schedule of reading to be carried out in advance. Students are expected to engage critically and creatively with the reading, and to contribute to online discussion.",

It always includes a review of grammar and close reading of several set texts, of varied character and difficulty. These texts will primarily be prose narratives, such as the creation accounts (Gen 1-3); the book of Jonah; the book of Ruth; or the prose framework of Job (Job 1-2, 42). Poetry may also be introduced towards the end of the course, such as a selection of Psalms, or excerpts from the prophets. The set texts will be read, translated, and analysed in depth.Student Learning ExperienceStudents have three hours of class time per week.

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course introduces biblical Hebrew - the language of ancient Israel/Judah, in which the Tanakh/Old Testament was written. The course is accessible to absolute beginners, and assumes no prior knowledge of the language. Students begin by learning the alphabet and writing system, followed by systematically studying grammar and incrementally acquiring vocabulary. Their learning is consolidated throughout the course through exercises, translations, and short quizzes. By the end of the course, they are able to read simple Hebrew prose and conduct a detailed examination of a set text taken from the Hebrew Bible.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course begins with an introduction to the alphabet and writing system, followed by a systematic review of grammar. The precise order of material may vary from year to year, but the following grammatical elements will be covered: nouns, adjectives, and particles; the strong verb (qal); the strong verb (other binyanim); the weak verb. This is supplemented by incremental vocabulary acquisition and frequent translation exercises. The course ends with a detailed study of a short narrative text from the Hebrew Bible, such as the first creation account (Genesis 1) or the Akedah (Genesis 22). Students will explore the grammatical, syntactic, and exegetical features of this text.Student Learning Experience Information:Students attend three classes per week where they will be taught new grammatical concepts, to ensure progressive consolidation of their learning. In a fourth weekly session, students will review what they've learnt and may participate in a short quiz. All sessions are thoroughly interactive, with plenty of opportunity for students to practice their new skills and to receive instant feedback from the teacher.

    "summary": "The Syriac tradition is one of the oldest in the history of Christianity. Spanning 2,000 years, Classical Syriac literature encompasses multiple genres, including some of the most ancient translations of the Bible, the earliest Christian poetry, and an important witness to Christian-Muslim interactions. Currently, however, only a handful of institutions in the world offer training in this subject. This course (open to levels 8-11) will provide students with a foundational introduction to Syriac as language and field.",
    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionThis course introduces students to Classical Syriac - the language of one of the most ancient traditions of Christianity. The course is accessible to absolute beginners and assumes no prior knowledge. Students begin by learning the alphabet and writing system, followed by a systematic study of grammar, syntax, and will acquire new vocabulary each week. Learning will be consolidated through short translation exercises and vocab quizzes. By the end of the course, students will be able to read simple Syriac prose, and conduct a detailed final exam of a set text taken from a 4th-century homily.Outline ContentThe course begins with an introduction to the alphabet, vocalic system, and pronunciation followed by a systematic overview of grammar. Elements of grammar will include: nouns (emphatic, absolute, construct); active and passive participles; strong and weak verbs (forms I-VI). This is supplemented by incremental vocabulary acquisition and frequent translation exercises from various textbooks. The course ends with an examination of a short extract of a homily by Ephrem of Syria (d. 373). Students will be required to analyse and parse out the grammatical, syntactic, and theological features of this text.Student Learning ExperienceThe course meets four times a week. The course tutor will explain new grammar, but students are encouraged to ask questions and actively engage with the course material. This includes students being required to not only read and translate sentences in Syriac but to also analyse and parse out their grammar. There is an expectation that students will come prepared for lessons and go over each class in their own time, memorising vocabulary, verb forms, and other aspects of the language. There will also be an audio-visual component of the teaching, namely video and tape recordings of Syriac recitation in liturgical settings by members of the community. This will provide students with a sense of the language as a living tradition. Students will demonstrate their achievements through class tests and a final exam.",

While some have pointed to considerable divergences in the way human rights are perceived in these two discursive traditions, others have argued that there is fact considerable identity of thought and practice between the two. This course introduces students to these conflicting perspectives in two ways. First, by equipping students with a basic introduction to the Islamic legal tradition and then by introducing them to the various ways in which this tradition has conceived of the notion of human rights. Second, by the study of the ways in which Muslim countries in the modern period have engaged with the substantive laws that have been formulated to uphold a global regime of human rights, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, major conventions on civil and political rights as well as social rights and conventions on the rights of women and children.",
    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionThis course surveys the variety of ways in which Islam and the Islamic legal tradition have conceived of human rights and the various responses by Muslim thinkers and Muslim states to contemporary discourses on human rights and to the normative framework of international human rights protection. After a brief overview of the Islamic legal tradition, its sources and its distinctive features, the course delves into a survey of the ways in which historical and contemporary Islamic legal discourse has conceived of human rights. It then surveys a variety of Islamic state practice which shows the multiplicity of ways in which Islamic states have acceded to international instruments of human rights protection or incorporated international human rights norms within their domestic legal orders.Syllabus and Outline ContentThe course begins by providing an introduction to the origins and development of Islamic law as well as the theoretical structure of the legal system in its developed, classical formulation. Topics considered will include the sources of Islamic law and their relative hierarchy, the role played by considerations of human welfare in creating Islamic legal norms and the theories of law and state that have been formulated in the Islamic legal tradition. The second part of the course will examine the theoretical underpinnings of international human rights discourse and compare these with the ways in which Muslim legal theorists, traditional and progressive, have conceived of human rights and created a discourse of human welfare and its advancement by the law. The third and final part of the course will consist of individual case studies of the ways in which Muslim states in the modern period have negotiated with the international regime of human rights norms, displaying a variety of responses on issues such as freedom of religion and expression, blasphemy, the rights of women and children and notions of political and social justice.Student Learning Experience Information:Students will study a selection of textual and visual primary and secondary sources on a relevant topic each week. Classes will be used for discussions on the sources, to raise questions and engage in deeper reflection on the topic and sources.

    "course_description": "Academic Description:The course introduces students to diverse perspectives and major debates in Islamic theology from the classical and contemporary periods. The course provides an in-depth understanding of the major schools of theology in both the classical Sunni and Shi'a traditions, and examines how new forms of theological analysis have emerged in the modern and post-colonial period. Topics may include, but are not limited to, the unity and attributes of God, the relationship between reason and revelation, divine power and human freedom, the eternality of the Qur'an, prophethood, the Imamate and political community, the problem of evil, and religious pluralism.  Students will have the opportunity to read selections from major primary texts (in translation or in Arabic where ability allows) and also engage with burgeoning secondary literature in the field of Islamic theology.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course will begin with a two-week study of the origins and history of Islamic theology, examining the emergence of different schools and how these thinkers engaged with the Qur'an, philosophy, and reason. After introducing this historical background, the course will then be organized thematically around key topics in Islamic thought. The course will always include an analysis of the three following themes: the unity and attributes of God, prophetology and the Qur'an, and human freedom. The other themes to be studied will vary from year to year and may include the caliphate and umma, the problem of evil, social and economic justice, religious pluralism, gender and embodiment, mysticism, and the law.Student Learning Experience Information:The course will include one hour of seminar discussion, with in depth analysis of both primary and secondary literature, and then will be followed by a one hour lecture to prepare students for the next week's material. The lecture aims to provide students with the necessary background and framing of the course readings in order for them to better analyze and evaluate the readings. In addition, each student will be asked to prepare a short 10 minute presentation on a major thinker in the Islamic tradition. These presentations will offer the students an opportunity to connect the readings to the biographies of major Muslim intellectuals and broaden the community of learning.

    "summary": "This comparative course examines Islamic and Christian views of Jesus of Nazareth and critically explores how narratives and understandings of Jesus have impacted Christian-Muslim Relations from the 7th Century to the Present Day.",
    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionJesus of Nazareth figures prominently in the scriptural, theological, and narrative understandings and religious practices of both the Christian and Islamic traditions. Both the New Testament and the Qur'an include extensive narratives about his birth, life, mission, teaching, and relationship to God. Muslims and Christians refer to Jesus as the Messiah, a prophet, a Word from God, and the son of Mary. And yet, Christians and Muslims also have had fundamental disagreements about Jesus that profoundly shape their theologies, scriptural interpretation, religious practices, and rituals. This comparative course offers a critical historical, scriptural, philosophical, and theological analysis of the importance of Jesus to both Islam and Christianity and how differing understandings of Jesus have fundamentally impacted Christian-Muslim Relations. Students will consider the relationship between the Qur'anic narratives of Jesus and Late Antiquite Christianity and Judaism, explore classical polemics, apologetics, and mystical depictions of Jesus in the Islamicate world, and critically evaluate contemporary proposals for understanding Jesus' role and legacy in Christian-Muslim Relations. Throughout the course students will engage in a dialogical and comparative study of Jesus and explore his relationship to other aspects of Christianity and Islam.OutlineThe course is divided into three major sections. The first scrutinizes the Qur'anic and Hadith material on Jesus, locating these texts and traditions within both Late Antique Christianity and early Islamic history. The course will investigate the historical, social, and religious contexts in which early Islamic depictions and understandings of Jesus emerged, giving particular critical attention to various theories of around the Jewish and Christian resonances or influences on the Qur'an.  Students will study questions of history, influence, and the differing function of the New Testament and Qur'an. The second section offers a close study of classical understanding of Jesus in Christian-Muslim Relations, focusing primarily on the Islamicate contexts from approximately 800-1400 common era. Themes to be considered may include prophetology, the unity of God and divinity of Christ, ritual practices of worship and veneration, the death of Jesus, the Mahdi, and mysticism. The final section examines modern understandings of Jesus, both from Christian and Muslim perspectives, that attempt to articulate the meaning and significance of Jesus in the context of contemporary Christian-Muslim debate. Throughout students will engage in a dialogical study that considers how understandings of Jesus impact Islamic and Christian ritual practices, scriptural readings, prophetology, theologies of God, political visions, and ethics.Student Learning ExperienceThe course will be delivered in the form of eleven weekly two-hour sessions. The first half of each session will be devoted to a lecture, and the second half to a discussion-based seminar focused on in-depth analysis and discussion of the assigned readings. Students are expected to complete the assigned readings for each week and to come prepared to discuss the issues, questions, and perspectives raised in the readings. Students will be assessed on their in class presentations, summary of their presentation, and research essay. By mid-way through the course, the instructor will meet with students to discuss their final research essay and offer comment on their outlines. Through their class participation and assignments, students will demonstrate their achievement of the learning outcomes.",

The concepts mentioned in the subtitle: coexistence, conflict and co-operation serve as broad structuring devices for the course, allowing the categorisation of examples while also asking for these categories to be critically explored. And concepts such as 'dialogue' and 'pluralism' will be problematised and examined in their historical and religious contexts.Syllabus/Outline ContentStudents will read a variety of primary sources, such as, but not limited to, plays, political pamphlets or speeches, religious treatises, literary texts, cartoons, scholarship and so on. The primary sources will be read alongside the expanding scholarship on Jewish/non-Jewish relations in different Humanities disciplines.Student Learning Experience InformationThe course consists of a lecture component and seminar discussion. The lecture component will be taught as a 'flipped classroom', either with an in-person lecture or with lecture materials provided online via Learn. The seminar discussion centres on the primary source texts assigned for the week. During the semester students write 3 short discussion papers or gobbets. The format of these will vary to engage with different writing and presentation styles. Level 11 students will be taught alongside level 10 students and have access to the same Learn site. In addition, level 11 students have their own regular seminar hour, in which additional source texts can be studied or a specific historical or religious issue can be discussed in more depth.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course is an option within the MSc in Science and Religion, but is also available to other postgraduate students. The course explores the important historical and contemporary issues in the science-religion debate through close study of key contributors and their texts. The aim is to develop a critical awareness of some of the important themes of contemporary dialogue, including ways in which they have surfaced and re-surfaced in different guises through modern history.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course provides a close engagement with eleven important contributors to the Science/Religion dialogue, through detailed study of key texts. The contributors who are chosen vary from year to year, but they will represent a broad range of issues in the Science/Religion field, including some of the most important historical trends from the beginnings of modern science to the present day.The course is roughly chronological in the way it is set out. It usually begins at the birth of modern science, either with a mediaeval scholastic thinker (e.g. Thomas Aquinas) or an early modern (e.g. Descartes) who has had a key influence on the genesis of modern science, and moves on to look at early religious consequences of the growth of modern science, such as the developments of Deism and Unitarianism (e.g. Joseph Priestley), and the vociferous debates concerning nineteenth-century geology (e.g. Hugh Miller) and Darwinism (e.g. T. H. Huxley). Afterwards, the course moves into the first half of the twentieth century, looking at thinkers such as Sir Arthur Eddington, and his apologetics for both physics and religion (which foreshadowed much of what is being said today in the New Atheism debate). His mystical approach from the perspective of physics can be seen to mirror those from a biological angle by Teilhard de Chardin, whose evolutionary speculations form the starting point for much contemporary Christological reflection. From there, the course looks at significant modern-day theologians and philosophers who have integrated scientific viewpoints into their work (e.g. Moltmann and Pannenberg, John Hedley Brooke, Nancey Murphy), and some of the scientists who have applied their work to theological topics (Peacocke and Polkinghorne).Student Learning Experience Information:The course is taught by means of eleven classes, each of which includes core content presented by one of the course teachers, a student presentation, and opportunity for class discussion. Except for the very first class, each class will require a schedule of reading to be carried out in advance. Students are expected to engage critically and creatively with the reading, and to contribute to class discussion.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:In an unjust world, what role can religion play in the struggle for human rights and the alleviation of suffering? This is the question that drives liberation theology, one of the most influential theological movements of the twentieth-century. Using a comparative framework, this course offers an advanced overview of liberation theology's development in Christianity and Islam. After analyzing the historical origins of liberation theology, we will examine a number of thematic categories, including class, race, and gender. Throughout the course, students will reflect on the following larger questions: How does social context shape our understanding of God, scripture, and religion as a whole? Whose lived experience gets to become 'the norm', the point of departure for theological reflection? How is religious authority construed and what are its social ramifications? Finally, how have Christians and Muslims (re)interpreted the Bible and Qur'an, respectively, through a liberating lens? That is, which new methods are they using, how do they depart from inherited, traditional methods, and what are the possibilities and potential pitfalls of these new methods?Syllabus/Outline Content:This course is based on comparative analysis, encouraging students to draw linkages (and discrepancies) between Christian and Muslim contexts. The weeks alternate between Christianity and Islam - rather than having half of the course devoted to Christianity and the other half to Islam - precisely to encourage such comparative reflection. Hence, it is the categories of analysis (namely: class, race, and gender) which are the driving frameworks of the course, contrasting Christian and Islamic perspectives. The course concludes by engaging criticisms of liberation theology by the Vatican and mainstream Islamic seminaries.A Note on Teaching Format:The lectures will be in-person and all students are expected to have completed the weekly readings before the lecture. This will be particularly important for the tutorial that will directly follow the lecture, as the tutorial will be discussion-based and students should be prepared to engage the issues, questions, and perspectives raised in the readings. If any students need to self-isolate, the lectures will be recorded and the tutorials will be streamed live (though not recorded). This digital option is only a last resort; unless they are sick or self-isolating, students must be present at both the lectures and tutorials.",

These movements include but are not limited to: Feminist, Black, Womanist, LGBTQ, Mujerista, Palestinian, Minjung, and Dalit theology. In order to provide a non-Christian perspective, Islamic examples will also be engaged, focusing on liberation theology, Black theology, and feminist theology. Throughout the course, close attention will be paid to methodology (praxis, preferential option for the poor) and the conceptualization of God, and of religion as a whole, from the vantage point of the margins.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course explores jataka stories - stories of the past lives of the Buddha - and their place within early Indian Buddhism. We will read a range of stories in English translation, and relate them to key themes and questions such as the role of the Buddha, the workings of karma and rebirth, the place of women, and the path to awakening. From stories of vows to future buddhahood, to tales of talking animals, jatakas offer a fascinating lens through which to view developments in Buddhist ethics and ideology. In addition, the stories form a key theme at early religious sites, where they are frequently depicted visually. Through studying this particularly rich and influential genre of early Indian literature, we will come to a better understanding of Buddhist values and attitudes, as well as of the ways in which narrative forms a crucial expression of religious ideas.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course will proceed through key themes in early Buddhism, drawing on appropriate primary readings as we go. Themes include: animal and human ethics; the role of the Buddha as teacher; karmic consequences and karmic communities; the path to Buddhahood and the perfections required for that attainment; the Buddha's good and bad karma; stories of extraordinary generosity or self-sacrifice; the role of women in the stories; the role of the stories in artistic contexts; connections with wider Indian literature.Student Learning Experience Information:The course will largely be taught alongside a level 10/Honours version, and Masters students will attend a joint two-hour class. The first hour will normally be student-led discussion of readings from primary texts (in translation). In some weeks this will involve student presentations. The second hour will be a discussion, led by the lecturer, of key themes and concepts that will enable full comprehension of the following week's readings; depending on covid-related room capacity issues this may be replaced with pre-recorded online materials. In addition to these classes, Masters students will have separate advanced seminars on a fortnightly basis, in which they will address additional material relating to the visual context of the stories and the place of jatakas in wider Indian literature. Assessment is through a series of short close analyses of primary source texts (30%) and a 3,000 word essay (70%) that explores a key theme in relation to both primary and secondary scholarship. Formative feedback will be offered on the close analyses and essay plans.",

    "course_description": "Academic description:The purpose of this course is twofold. First, it provides students with the foundational knowledge of Islam's key textual disciplines and ritual traditions. Second, the course equips students with the analytical tools and frameworks to engage in the critical study of Islam within the scholarly disciplines of Theology and Religious Studies. How does the study of 'Islam' differ from the study of 'Muslims', and why does this conceptual distinction matter? We will examine the major themes, debates, and contentions that have emerged within the field over the past few decades. In particular, we will explore how conceptions of hermeneutical method, religious authority, and the state have transformed in contemporary Islamic studies.Syllabus/outline content:Four overarching themes will be explored, and both course objectives (that is, foundations of Islam and conceptual issues in the critical study of Islam) will be engaged within each theme. While each bullet point does not necessarily represent a particular week, over the duration of the course, all of these areas will be addressed.A)\tScripture and Tradition-\tFoundations: Introduction to the Qur'an, Hadith, and primary Islamic texts-\t'Confessional' and Western revisionist accounts of Islamic origins-\t'Traditional' hermeneutical approaches to Islamic textsB)\tRitual-\tFoundations: Introduction to Muslim ritual and liturgy-\tThe intersections between the study of religion, anthropology, and ethnography: Muslim ritual as a case studyC)\tAuthority and Gender-\tFoundations: the 'ulama and the classical construction of sacred authority-\tThe fragmentation of religious authority, new hermeneutical methods, and emerging communitiesD)\tIslam, Politics, and Cosmopolitanism-       Foundations: Classical conceptions of 'Muslim Politics'-\tContemporary Islamism, 'theocracy', and the nation state-\tThe de-centering of Arab(ic) and Middle East studies in Islamic studiesStudent learning experience information:The course will be delivered in the form of eleven weekly two-hour seminar sessions. Students will be expected to complete the assigned readings for each week and to come prepared to discuss the issues, questions, and perspectives raised in the readings. Segments of lecturing will be integrated in the two hour session in order to provide critical background knowledge. As noted in the assessment section, each student will present on a topic of interest directly related to the course and submit a 500 word summary of their presentation. Students will also be assessed on their research essay, and, early in the semester, the instructor will meet with students to give formative oral feedback on their essay topics. Through these activities and class participation, students will demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes.",

    "course_description": "A: Academic descriptionThis course focuses on many of the most important writings of Christian women through the period c.200-c.1440, seeking to draw out common themes, similarities and dissimilarities in their experiences of Christianity, of authorship and of the Church. The course will consider the literary and rhetorical techniques of each of the writers, their level of theological sophistication and originality, the level of authority they claim and are accorded, and the light they shed on Christianity in their own societies.B: Syllabus/outline contentThe course will begin with an introduction to the overall context of the writers to be studied, looking briefly at roles open to women in the Christianity of the second to fourth centuries, the Ottonian and Byzantine Empires, the monasteries and beguinages of High Medieval Europe, and the roles open to lay women mystics and other writers in Late Medieval Europe.  It will proceed to consider ten great women writers, week by week, in their historical and theological contexts, focusing above all on the writings of the women themselves, but also looking at scholarly critical evaluation of them.Week 1: Introduction: Women in Christianity to c.1440Week 2: Perpetua and Christian MartyrdomWeek 3: Desert Mothers: Amma Syncletica, Amma Theodora and Amma SarraWeek 4: Egeria, Christian Pilgrimage and the Holy LandWeek 5: The Christian plays of Hrotsvitha of GandersheimWeek 6: Anna Komnene and the First Crusade through Eastern EyesWeek 7: Gertrude of Helfta's Spiritual ExercisesWeek 8: Marguerite Porete's Mirror of Simple SoulsWeek 9: Catherine of Siena's Dialogue of Divine ProvidenceWeek 10: Christine de Pizan's Book of the City of LadiesWeek 11: The Book of Margery KempeC: Student Learning Experience InformationThis dedicated Masters course will function as a series of seminars. Each week a student will present the topic for the week, which will also be posted 24 hours before the class on a class blog. The course instructor will draw out the key themes for the week via class discussion on the basis of the text and secondary readings for the week, and provide additional historical context.

    "course_description": "Academic Description:The relationship between mind and matter gets to the heart of some of the central questions in the science and religion discussion, and, indeed, to the central questions about fundamental reality. What is mind, and how does it relate to physical matter? How does mind relate to religious conceptions of God, who is often considered to be relational, conscious, and spiritual? Are there limits to what science can tell us about consciousness (both human and divine)? Addressing such questions is an inherently interdisciplinary task, and requires engagement with such fields as philosophy of mind, metaphysics, neurobiology, psychology, and theology. This level 11 course introduces students to the complex questions involved, emphasizing theological and philosophical challenges to scientific approaches to mentality, but also scientific challenges to religious claims about the mind. The course will enable students to engage and critically evaluate perspectives from a variety of disciplines on the relationship between mind and matter, and to do so in a manner that prioritizes interdisciplinary dialogue.Syllabus Outline/Content:The course will cover concepts and approaches surrounding the relationship between mind and matter, including:- The metaphysical and philosophical positions most relevant to debates about mind and matter, including naturalism and physicalism- The question of the causal joint, or how spiritual realities might interact with the physical world- Theological models of the God-world relationship, with particular emphasis on panentheism (the idea that the universe exists within God, but God is more than the world), and pneumatology (an account of the Spirit's relationship to the physical world)- The question of the soul, in conversation with neurobiology, philosophy, and theology- Theological and scientific perspectives on panpsychism (the idea that all physical reality has mentality, in some way)- The 'Hard Problem of Consciousness', and the question of whether the human mind can ever be explained with the language and tools of contemporary science- Quantum theology and the Tao of physics (questions of physical reality raised by quantum mechanics, and their implications for religious belief)- Certain key thinkers in science and religion will also be featured, such as Wolfhart Pannenberg (with emphasis on his integration of the Spirit and field theory) and Arthur Eddington (with emphasis on his integration of physics and mind)Student Learning Experience Information:The course will be taught through one lecture per week, and a weekly seminar focusing on a set text that provides in-depth engagement with primary sources related to lecture topics. Students will be assessed by a student presentation, as well by means of an essay. Through these pieces of assessment, and their participation in the regular lectures and seminars, students will demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:The relationship between mind and matter gets to the heart of some of the central questions in the science and religion discussion, and, indeed, to the central questions about fundamental reality. What is mind, and how does it relate to physical matter? How does mind relate to religious conceptions of God, who is often considered to be relational, conscious, and spiritual? Are there limits to what science can tell us about consciousness (both human and divine)? Addressing such questions is an inherently interdisciplinary task, and requires engagement with such fields as philosophy of mind, metaphysics, neurobiology, psychology, and theology. This level 11 course introduces students to the complex questions involved, emphasizing theological and philosophical challenges to scientific approaches to mentality, but also scientific challenges to religious claims about the mind. The course will enable students to engage and critically evaluate perspectives from a variety of disciplines on the relationship between mind and matter, and to do so in a manner that prioritizes interdisciplinary dialogue.Syllabus Outline/Content:A week-by-week account of the course is included later in this proposal. The course will cover concepts and approaches surrounding the relationship between mind and matter, including:- The metaphysical and philosophical positions most relevant to debates about mind and matter, including naturalism and physicalism- The question of the causal joint, or how spiritual realities might interact with the physical world- Theological models of the God-world relationship, with particular emphasis on panentheism (the idea that the universe exists within God, but God is more than the world), and pneumatology (an account of the Spirit's relationship to the physical world)- The question of the soul, in conversation with neurobiology, philosophy, and theology- Theological and scientific perspectives on panpsychism (the idea that all physical reality has mentality, in some way)- The 'Hard Problem of Consciousness', and the question of whether the human mind can ever be explained with the language and tools of contemporary science- Quantum theology and the Tao of physics (questions of physical reality raised by quantum mechanics, and their implications for religious belief)- Certain key thinkers in science and religion will also be featured, such as Wolfhart Pannenberg (with emphasis on his integration of the Spirit and field theory) and Arthur Eddington (with emphasis on his integration of physics and mind)Student Learning Experience Information:The course will be taught through one online lecture per week, and weekly discussion board participation focussed on set texts. There will also be four live seminars, led by instructors and teaching assistants. Students will be assessed by means of an essay, as well as through participation in the online discussion board. Through these pieces of assessment, students will demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes.",

Lectures and seminars offer students the opportunity to contemplate the specific mechanisms, beliefs, and practices involved in the worldwide diffusion of Christian religion and the making of a global faith.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description: Religious identities and practices have long defied national and territorial borders and this course aims at contemplating the specifics of this feature of the modern world. This course offers students the opportunity to examine the ideas, mechanisms, and practices that allowed Christian actors and organisations to reach across geographical boundaries and forge transnational faith communities. Specifically, the course concentrates on the role of the missionary enterprise, the use of modern media, and migratory/diasporic movements in the creation of a global religion. By bringing together insights from history, theology, and the social sciences, this course draws attention to both the historical depth and contemporaneity of these processes, their ideational underpinnings, and the social and cultural configurations emerging in their wake. Lectures and seminars will contemplate the far-reaching religious networks created by mission organisations and migratory movements and the cultural interactions arising from the worldwide diffusion of Christianity.Outline Content: Lectures and seminars are grouped around three units: 1) The first block focuses on the theology and history of Christian missions, examining the intellectual foundations of the modern missionary enterprise and the encounters of Protestant and Catholic missionaries with indigenous peoples and cultures; 2) The second section looks closely at how material, print, and digital media reach out across geographical boundaries and connect Christian communities worldwide; 3) The final unit explores how mass human migration and diaspora shape the contours of global Christianity in both historical and contemporary perspectives.Student Learning Experience: This postgraduate course will be taught by the faculty members of the Centre for the Study of World Christianity in two-hour weekly seminars, with a ten-minute break in the middle. The first hour will be an introductory discussion led by the lecturer for the week. The second hour comprises a close discussion of the readings for the week, which will be led either by the lecturer or begin with a presentation by one of the students taking the class (for credit or for audit). The final assessment consists of a 4000-word essay on a topic chosen by the student.",

It aims to describe, contextualize and explain key features of these new spiritualities with reference to their content and structure and to their distribution in the population at large. By the end of the course students should be able to describe the recent history and ethnography of the 'new spiritualities', outline their key ideas and beliefs, and form a critical assessment of their impact, both on public understanding and within the academic study of religion.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course investigates the modern field of popular beliefs and practices grouped here under the rubric of 'new spiritualities'. We examine case studies of practices, beliefs and biographies, drawing on explanatory insights from social and cultural theorists. The course aims to describe, contextualize and explain key features of the new spiritualities with reference to their content and structure and to their distribution and impact in society at large.Syllabus/Outline Content:We begin with the problem of demarcating a fluid field of beliefs and practices that crosses traditional boundaries of 'religious' and 'secular'. We examine definitions and models of 'new spiritualities' and discuss the implications of their inclusion in the comparative study of religion/s. We explore the role of authorities and traditions in the development of a culture of seekership and we consider evidence for an emerging cosmology to support and legitimate these practices. Finally we trace the permeation of new spiritualities into everyday life settings. An important whole course learning outcome is the capacity to make an informed and mature judgement on the salience of new spiritualities, both in the study of 'religion/s', and as a social and cultural phenomenon in their own right.Student Learning Experience:The course requires MSc students to attend joint lectures with Honours undergraduate students, facilitating rich interactions between advanced undergraduate and early postgraduate sensibilities. This interaction is encouraged in the classroom and nurtures reflexive insight on the part of MSc students. The students then have their own, separate tutorial each week. Individual consultation with the course manager in relation to the digital case study and extended essay consolidates a holistic and flexible learning experience that can incorporate particular substantive interests of MSc students (eg. in particular examples of new spiritualities).",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:The aim of this interdisciplinary course is to enable students to be able to research and to analyse in detail a range arts including the visual arts (e.g. paintings, sculptures, murals), film, photography, music, literature, theatre and dance, that have emerged out of a variety of historical and cultural settings. Through this analysis and engagement with specific artwork and pertinent secondary literature, students will investigate the ambivalent role of the arts in peacebuilding and its complex relation to diverse theologies. Detailed analysis will focus upon how individual works can contribute to building peace, and interact with religious traditions, beliefs and practices.Syllabus/Outline Content:Different kinds of art created will be considered in detail, including: visual arts (weeks 1-2), photography (week 3), film (5-6), theatre and dance (7-8), literature (9-10), and music (11). These case studies will be based upon one introductory week (1), which will lay the theoretical and practical foundations for the analysis and case studies that follow. Students will be strongly encouraged by the end of the first two weeks to have read set Introductory texts to lay the necessary theoretical foundations.Student Learning Experience:The course involves one two-hour seminar per week and one one-hour post-graduate smaller tutorial. The full class seminar (2hrs, with honours students) will consist of a combination of interactive lecture-style presentations, discussion and analysis of both the primary and secondary texts. Students will be required to research and then present to the class example relevant to the week's theme. Through participation in seminars, prepared readings and tutorial discussions, as well as through the written work included in the assessment schedule, students will demonstrate their achievement of theintended learning outcomes.",

Some of the most challenging contemporary areas of modern science will feature, but specialised prior knowledge will not be assumed. Quantum mechanics, relativity, cosmology, evolutionary biology, neuroscience, human origins and the search for extraterrestrial existence will feature, along with the big issues for religious belief: the problem of evil, miracles, the theologies of creation and providence. All of these will form the backdrop to this exploration of one of the most far-reaching intellectual debates of modern times.Much of course 1 will be taken up with in-depth study of the idea of 'reality'. Not only will this foster a good understanding of the relevant debates in the philosophy of science and the philosophy of religion, it will involve understanding the different accounts of the beginnings (and end) of the universe. This will set the scene for course 2, which will also focus on the issue of 'reality', but from the perspective of embodied life, and the importance of 'mind'. The aim is to foster an in-depth philosophical understanding of the role of religious belief in modern scientific practice, and of the challenge of science to religious orthodoxies.Syllabus/Outline Content:1.\tDarwin and Design2.\tPhilosophical Problems in Evolutionary Biology3.\tThe Problem of Evil4.\tTheistic Evolution and Natural Evil5.\tThe Cognitive Science of Religion6.\tConsciousness and the Soul7.\tWhat is a Human?8.\tExtra-Terrestrial Intelligence and Incarnation9.\tThe End of the World",

Indeed, to what extent can we refer to political Islam as a singular movement -'it' - and, if we cannot, what binds diverse political Islamic groups together? That is, what sets them apart from other political parties in Muslim societies? This course will engage these questions by offering both a historic and thematic survey of political Islamic thought.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course is comprised of two components:- The first component - 'Conceptual Framing' - sets the stage for discussion by assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the frameworks often used to analyze the phenomenon at hand. These include (but are not limited to) 'Political Islam', 'Muslim Politics', and 'Islamism'. This component will also provide the broader historical and global backdrop in which political Islamic thought emerged.- The second component - 'Thinkers and their Contexts' - represents the bulk of the course, offering case studies of the pioneering thinkers in political Islamic thought. Through reading primary texts in translation, students will be directly exposed to their writings. At the same time, students will contextualize their ideas by examining their social settings.A Note on Teaching Format:The lectures will be in-person and all students are expected to have completed the weekly readings before the lecture. This will be particularly important for the tutorial that will directly follow the lecture, as the tutorial will be discussion-based and students should be prepared to engage the issues, questions, and perspectives raised in the readings. If any students need to self-isolate, the lectures will be recorded and the tutorials will be streamed live (though not recorded).

Where does theological thinking intersect with politics? Where does politics intersect with theological thinking? And why are these intersections important? Questions like these are asked and answered in the increasingly interdisciplinary field of political theology. The field connects philosophy and theology to political, cultural, legal, and literary studies, thus offering robust and radical accounts of the roles of religion in pluralising and polarising political contexts. This course examines key thinkers and key themes in political theology, concentrating on global challenges in the 20th and the 21st century. It aims to enable students to evaluate and engage with theological thinking in politics and politics in theological thinking both critically and constructively.OutlineThe course is organised around key thinkers and key themes in political theology. Framed by 'Introduction' and 'Conclusion' that cover the emergence and the evolution of the increasingly interdisciplinary field, the course will(1)\texamine the formations of political theology in classic 20th-century debates (in weeks 2 to 4),(2)\texplore the frontiers of political theology in contemporary 21st-century debates (in weeks 5 to 7), and(3)\tevaluate the fallout of political theology as it continues to stir up controversy in the political sphere today (in weeks 8 to 10).Student Learning ExperienceThe course is structured around a lecture of one hour that introduces students to the topic of the week. The lecture is complemented by a seminar session of one hour dedicated to the discussion of set texts. The texts are selected to show the spectrum of thinkers and themes studied in political theology. The seminar sessions include student presentations of around ten minutes with a view to initiating discussion. These presentations can cover either a classic political-theological publication or a current political-theological problem. In addition to their presentation in class, students will be assessed by an essay that demonstrates the achievement of the learning outcomes of the course.",

    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionAs a field of study, public theology has expanded rapidly and evolved radically throughout the 20th and the 21st centuries. It involves scholars from different and diverse disciplines in discussions of issues that are stirring up controversy in the public square today. Particularly after events such as 9/11, theological language and theological literacy have taken on a new meaning in the public square. While the course concentrates on Christianity in its European and American contexts, it covers a variety of public theologies from around the world. By examining the emergence and the evolution of the field through its key thinkers and its key themes, the course seeks to enable students to evaluate and engage with theologies in the public square today both critically and constructively.OutlineThe course is organised around key thinkers and key themes in public theology. Framed by 'Introduction' and 'Conclusion' that cover the emergence and the evolution of the field, the course will(1)\texamine the inventions of public theology in sociological, philosophical, and theological scholarship on religion (in weeks 2 to 4),(2)\texplore the interpretations of public theology that have shaped the field throughout history (in weeks 5 to 7), and(3)\tevaluate the issues that are stirring up controversy in public theology today (in weeks 8 to 10).Student Learning ExperienceThe course is structured around a lecture of one hour that introduces students to the topic of the week. The lecture is complemented by a seminar session of one hour dedicated to the discussion of set texts. The texts are selected to show the spectrum of thinkers and themes studied in public theology. The seminar sessions include student presentations of around ten minutes with a view to initiating discussion. These presentations can cover either a classic public-theological publication or a current public-theological problem.In addition to their participation and presentation in class, students will be assessed by an essay of 4000 words on a topic relevant to the field of public theology. Through these assessments, students will demonstrate the achievement of the learning outcomes of the course.",

    "summary": "This module examines the diverse and complicated relationship between processes of religiosity and experiences of race and racialisation through cross religious tradition explorations, paying specific attention to indigenous and Afro-diasporic practices and the fluid overlaps between these categories. However, it also looks at capacious forms of spirituality beyond them. It draws from mostly contemporary but also some historical examinations and perspectives, bringing together insights from the humanities and the social sciences, interrogating social and cultural configurations, while situating them in a broader global genealogical lineage.",
    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionThis course offers an introductory exploration into the complex dynamics between racialisation and religiosity. It sets up a strong foundation in critical race studies and closely engages with a variety of disciplines such as Black Studies; Social Anthropology; Human Geography; Religious Studies; Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies and Latin American and Caribbean Studies. This new module takes advantage of the expertise of new staff and will explores topics through a variety of empirical perspectives such as fine-grained ethnographic examples, examinations of material culture, and insights from the arts (music, dance, literature, etc.) whilst also offering an introduction to foundational theoretical considerations that include but also go beyond political sovereignty, questions of ontology, and globalisation.Outline ContentIn each week, the module will focus on a different theme (although they are all overlapping) and investigate how these themes speak to the socio-cultural formations and power structures of both race and religiosity, taking each processually rather than as static categories.  The encounters and intersections between race and religiosity are multifaceted and require critical foundations in some knowledge of racial theory which underwrites each class, as such the module will also offer some preliminary background context to the study of race.Student Learning ExperienceThe module has a programme of a two-hour lecture and additional seminar which will include interactive elements. Additionally, the resources\u00c2\u00bfas much as possible\u00c2\u00bfwill be multimodal, with the inclusion of short and longer videos, podcasts, and where applicable and possible, art exhibits (virtual and/or in person.) There will be a list of essential and recommended readings for each week and students are expected to read the texts before class.",

    "summary": "This course explores leading intellectuals and historical events in the making of 'modern theology' (a broad group of Western schools of thought reimagining theology in response to the challenges of the Enlightenment) in the long nineteenth century - a period bookended by the Enlightenment and the First World War.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:Beginning with Immanuel Kant, and working forwards to the likes of Sigmund Freud and Max Weber, this course explores leading intellectuals and historical events in the making of 'modern theology' in the long nineteenth century in the Western world. We examine primary texts in their specific historical contexts with an emphasis on close reading and engaged discussion in order to understand the powerful religious transformations of modernity, theories of secularisation, and new forms of renewal alongside specific theological issues in historical perspective. Alongside the detailed study of primary texts, the class provides experience in studying the more recent reception and interpretation of the figures studied.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course begins by considering the nature of theological inquiry at the threshold of the nineteenth century. After discussing the Enlightenment and French Revolution, it considers the role of Romanticism and Idealism in shaping theological reflection in figures such as Friedrich Schleiermacher and G.W.F. Hegel. Attention is given to various prominent critiques of the Bible and religion offered by key thinkers in the period, for instance, D.F. Strauss, S\u00c3\u00b8ren Kierkegaard, Herman Bavinck, and Friedrich Nietzsche, and the major attempts to construct theological programmes in response. Questions of secularisation and important instances of theological renewal and religious revival are considered together. The course concludes by examining the cate of the notable syntheses characteristic of the nineteenth century, the relation of theology to modern Western culture, and the rise of new theological and religious movements in the face of the First World War.Student Learning Experience:The course will be delivered through two 50-minute classes each week. The first of these will be a lecture, and the second, a seminar in which that week's set readings will be discussed. Through primary source reading, students will become skilled interpreters of the development of late modern Western culture, and the changing place (and shape) of theology therein. Students should be prepared for a weekly reading schedule - and should expect that commitment to be intellectually rewarding.Each student will choose a topic for a research essay (3000 words), with the support of the course organiser. As a key element in the essay-writing process, students will participate in a feedback/feedforward session with the course organiser: this session will take place prior to essay submission, and will involve students giving a presentation on their proposed essay topic.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course aims to investigate the manner in which religion and nationalism interact.  It will demonstrate that the importance of religion on contemporary debates ranging from nationalism to its place in the public sphere is far from marginal, but central to the way we should think about the global world system.  In order to achieve this, the course combines strong theoretical discussions ranging from classical theories from the French Revolution to more recent postcolonial scholarship, alongside detailed case studies from around the world that has many contemporary resonances. These debates will be carefully considered both in the lectures and the seminar discussions based on readings that are both empirically rich and theoretically innovative.Syllabus/Outline Content:The complexity and richness of the course will be illustrated through thematic considerations such as the importance of homeland, gender, mapping, the discourse of ethnic election, postcolonial nationalisms, the relationship between state, nation, religious identities, secularism, to the resurgence of indigenous peoples' place in the world system.  It will discuss the ways in which modern theories of nationalism provide a lens through which nations can be understood both in its modern guise, but also in the way its roots in antiquity have been central to its identity in the present.  It will examine classic books on nationalism such as Imagined Communities by Benedict Anderson; The Ethnic Origin of Nations by Anthony D. Smith; to the importance of postcolonial and poststructuralist thinkers to this debate by scholars such as Partha Chatterjee and Talal Asad.Student Learning Experience Information:The course has a programme of two-hour weekly meetings consisting of one-hour weekly lectures, and one-hour seminar discussions.  This will be complemented by five separate hour-each PG seminars, where more in-depth and advanced discussions will be held. Each student will do a presentation based on the assigned reading and will be responsible for leading class discussion during the seminar hour.  Students are also required to write a weekly-assessed blog that will demonstrate their understanding and engagement with the readings.  Students will also have the opportunity to construct an essay title that focuses on a topic of their interest in conversation with the lecturer.

    "course_description": "Academic Description:The course explores themes relating to religion and the Enlightenment in its national contexts in Europe and North America between the mid seventeenth century and the early nineteenth century.  It considers the extent to which the Enlightenment represented a major shift of Western thought away from traditional patterns of religion belief and practice.  The course both evaluates the challenges posed to Christianity by the radical Enlightenment, and it reflects on the mainstream movement that can be described as the Christian Enlightenment. It also considers the emergence of the Romantic movement and the relations between Enlightened and Romantic views of religious faith.Syllabus/Outline Content:The course applies historical approaches to religious beliefs and Enlightenment thought, with a strong emphasis on skills in assessing historical evidence.  Themes include the rise of modern science and the 'disenchantment' of nature; the 'deist controversy'; absolutism, Enlightened despotism, and the alliance of throne and altar; conceptions of providence in history; the development of critical approaches to the Christian scriptures; Enlightened approaches to the passions and religion; the Churches and the American and French Revolutions; movements of religious awakening during the era of democratic revolutions, and religion and early Romanticism.  We will read works by a number of key thinkers, including Baruch Spinoza, John Locke, John Toland, Baron d'Holbach, Voltaire, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Jefferson, Tom Paine, Germaine de Sta\u00c3\u00abl, and Friedrich Schleiermacher.Student Learning Experience Information:The course meets weekly for a two-hour session, with the first hour devoted to a lecture and the second hour to a discussion of a key text or texts.  The lectures are extensively illustrated with images, and there is opportunity for questions and discussion.

    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionThis course focuses on religious responses to the environment and the climate change crisis. Utilising sociological and historical analysis of a number of case studies, we explore in depth how religions respond to environmental crisis at institutional and grassroots levels. In doing so we explore shifting relationships of power between individuals, communities and institutions, and the ongoing dynamic interplay between religion and society.Syllabus/Outline Content:The first half of the course considers the ways in which religious traditions conceptualise, frame and engage with environmental issues and the climate crisis. We focus on illustrative case studies from various traditions, to exemplify and critically examine how religions make sense of these issues.The second half of the course focuses on practical responses to the climate crisis, using a series of case studies to explore the ways in which religious groups and individuals have sought to mobilise in response to environmental challenge. Through these, we will encounter a range of sociological and anthropological debates, issues and methodologies, including issues of power, gender, and the interplay between individuals, religious communities and religious institutions.Student Learning Experience Information:The course will be delivered through a weekly two-hour class. The first hour will be a student-led seminar that will engage with the readings assigned in and the case studies pertinent to the theme of that week. The second hour will be a lecture that focuses on the key theme of the upcoming week.The final essay provides an opportunity for a more expansive engagement with primary and secondary sources.",

It studies the diversity of traditions and of innovations through comparisons between indigenous religions, Christianities and forms of Islam. It analyses the connection between religion, society and politics. It also explores the coexistence, conflict and imbrication of these various traditions and asks how interaction between distinct religious beliefs and practices is understood by religious practitioners to enrich and/or diminish those traditions.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:To enable students to comprehend African religious diversity and draw wide-ranging comparative conclusions the course explores 1) Current themes and historical background to the study of religion in Africa and its diaspora. 2) In-depth case studies from Africa and its diaspora.The course takes a thematic approach to its subject demonstrating the variety of approaches to healing, gender, and so on. It uses ethnographic case-studies to explore similar themes which intersect religion and public life and examines the diversity of lived approaches across different religious traditions, in different parts of Africa and the world.The course balances cultural interests in the internal working of religions with their social impact on the societies in which they operate. The contemporary social science focus of the lectures is supported by a robust historical understanding of religions in Africa and their study.Syllabus/Outline Content:In the first weeks of this course the subject will be introduced through discussing ideas of religion, Africa, indigeneity, syncretism and global movements. This will include historical background on the study of Religions in Africa and Diaspora. The following weeks will examine a number of themes which intersect religion and public life and which recur across different religious traditions: Healing and wholeness, Communication and Media, Gender and Sexuality, Transnationalism and Diaspora, Violence, Spiritual and Political powerStudent Learning Experience Information:The students will study a selection of textual and visual primary and secondary sources on a relevant topic each week. During the class there will be discussion of the sources and opportunities to raise further questions as well as a more formal lecture to introduce the topic and its sources. Assessment will be through a long essay and a choice of seminar presentation or fieldwork/interview assessment. The two assessed elements will be on a particular aspect of the course.",

    "summary": "An exploration of issues of 'science and religion' through the lens of literature, both prose and poetry, spanning the last two and a half millennia. The aim is to develop a critical awareness of how the tensions between science and faith have been explored by great writers to a far wider extent than either traditional literary studies or the modern field of 'science and theology' has recognised.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course is an option within the MSc in Science and Religion, but is available to other postgraduate students interested in ways that the Science-Religion dialogue can be explored through literature. The course represents a substantially new direction in the Science and Religion field. Thus far, the field has been dominated by philosophy and its approaches, as the effective mediators between science and religion. The interplay between spiritual and material realities has been approached largely using the techniques of linear argument and logic. Recognising with Wittgenstein and others that language is at the heart of all human reasoning and cognition, this course explores the potential to create a new form of dialogue between science and religion, using the creative approaches of poetry and literature. This is not to generate yet another form of literary criticism, nor is it simply to appreciate literature in itself, but it is to seek to understand the crucial roles of literary devices and literary art in describing the realities both within our grasp and beyond it. The Christian tradition, for instance, makes frequent use of metaphor and simile in describing mysterious spiritual/material realities such as the ;ascension of Jesus', or the 'kingdom of God'. Believers claim that these stand for objective realities, but they are only accessible to us at present through the tricks of language. This course will seek a way into these and related issues by exploring the ways that great authors of the past have exploited language in their search for scientific and religious truth.Syllabus/Outline Content:After an introductory survey, the module asks students to engage in close reading of particular texts, by authors such as Mary Shelley, R.L. Stevenson, Aldous Huxley, Bertholt Brecht and R.S. Thomas, to tease out how the complex interrelationship between science and religion (and indeed the variegated meaning of those two highly ambiguous terms themselves) has been treated by authors from a variety of backgrounds, and certainly from different sides of the 'faith divide'.Student Learning Experience Information:The course is taught by means of eleven classes, each of which includes core content presented by one of the course teachers, a student presentation, and opportunity for class discussion. Except for the very first class, each class will require a schedule of reading to be carried out in advance. Students are expected to engage critically and creatively with the reading, and to contribute to class discussion.",

    "summary": "This course introduces students to the world of magic in the Islamic world. Dismissed as anti-rational by European colonialism and Islamic reformism, magic and other occult pursuits often played an important role in the religious, political, and intellectual lives of Muslims. Making extensive use of both literary and visual sources, this course will examine how past and present scholars have attempted to define the occult and esoteric. It will outline several themes such as the role of sorcery in everyday life, politics, and the investigation of science. Surveyed topics include astrology, geomancy, treasure hunting, demonology, alchemy, and necromancy.",
    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionThis course will examine key aspects of sorcery in the history of Islam, from the earliest period to the early modern. It will deal specifically with the ways in which ideas about the wondrous and magical informed the religious, intellectual, and political lives of Muslims. It will include discussions about the place of the occult and esoteric in Islamic thought, and the ever-shifting boundaries between magic, science, and nature. As in medieval and renaissance Europe, occult practices among Muslims often involved material objects such as diagrams, amulets, and other paraphernalia. As such, this course will make extensive use of visual as well as literary sources.Syllabus/OutlineThis course will apply historical approaches to the concept of sorcery in the Islamic world, with a strong emphasis on scholarly debates and skills for assessing evidence. Themes studied will include: scholarly debates around definitions of categories like 'magic', 'occult', and 'esoteric'; what Muslims in everyday life believed about the 'supernatural'; various discourses on magic in Islamic thought; magical themes in Islamic literature; the influence of the Islamicate occult sciences on medieval and renaissance Europe. The course begins with theories of the occult and esoteric among pre-modern Islamic thinkers and contemporary scholars, and moves onto key themes such as miracles in Islam; foundation legends surrounding arcane texts; connections between magic, cosmology, and the study of nature; jinn and fantastic beasts; divination (astrology, geomancy, and physiognomy); grimoires; talismans; alchemy; and the political uses of magic. The course will end with a discussion about the impact of modernity on magical practices in the Islamicate world. In addition to literary primary sources, students will engage with visual material via digital collections (e.g. magic squares, manuscript illuminations of jinn and marvellous beasts, astrological tables, and amuletic shirts).Student Learning ExperienceThe course comprises a one-hour lecture for both Levels 10 and 11, though each will receive separate tutorials. Prior coming to class, students are expected to have read at least one primary (written or visual) and one secondary source. Students will demonstrate their achievements by submitting bi-weekly reflections of secondary sources. This will help them develop a critical appreciation of the state of the field; and completing a final essay on any topic covered in class.",

Students are encouraged to explore the connections between a varied range of Scottish poets, authors, and dramatists in their evolving national, historical, social and theological contexts.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:This interdisciplinary course will enable students to trace and examine the rich and constantly evolving nature of religious thought in Scotland through selected literary texts published from the Romantic period to the late-twentieth century. In order to achieve this, the work of a variety of writers from different religious (and non-religious) perspectives is considered in historical, theological and social contexts. By analysing key critical terms and concepts which inform Scottish literary texts, including plays, poetry, novels, and short stories, students will relate texts to the religious environments which shaped them. In this way, they will gain a fuller and more enriched understanding of the relationship between Scottish literature and religion.Syllabus/Outline Content:This course will begin with consideration of how national literatures are constructed, before moving on to explore selected Scottish texts, religious voices, and literary forms each week in their historical and theological contexts. The course is chronological in structure, and moves through writing reflecting romantic supernaturalism, themes of social and religious change, and Victorian religious pessimism, to twentieth-century reconstructions of Scotland's early religious history and conflict. The course's final weeks reflect the growing religious pluralism and diversity of modern Scotland in selected texts, which nonetheless draw on earlier Scottish literary forms and themes in their exploration of the nation's religious imagination.Student Learning Experience Information:This course has a programme of a weekly lecture and seminar, plus 5 additional tutorials for level 11 students. On the basis of students' preparatory reading of a range of literary texts and other writings, seminars will be used to explore and compare the connections between Scottish authors, poets, and dramatists in their evolving religious and social milieus. Preparation for seminars will also depend on students each leading (or co-leading) discussion in one week of the course. This will involve leading a conversation centred on key theological, ethical and religious themes in the texts. Students will also be required to give formal presentations in the seminar and they will submit these in written form.The structure for this course is chronological, and though these texts respond to the age in which they are written, many also deal with historical religious conflicts, developments and devotions. As such, students will be encouraged to explore the connections between historical periods, and they will be guided through the examination of concepts such as national literature and religious change. Students will also be offered formative feedback as the course progresses. This will help them to develop the knowledge and analytical skills that will be assessed in the course's assignments.",

This God attacks his chosen ones, he demands child sacrifice and genocide, and he inflicts misery and violence on his people.

    "course_description": "Academic Description: The Hebrew Bible contains number of texts that trouble the conventional Jewish and Christian understandings of God and challenge the reader of the Hebrew Bible. This God attacks his chosen ones from behind, he demands child sacrifice and genocide, and he inflicts misery and violence on his people. This course aims to integrate these seemingly incongruous texts in a differentiated understanding of the Hebrew Bible and its image of God. A historical critical reading contextualizes the texts as theological expressions in their time and integrates them into an image of God that is not always comprehensive and comfortable.Due to the topic of the course, there are some (textual) depictions of violence that participants might find upsetting.Outline Content:Each week will focus on a set primary text accompanied by two or more secondary readings. The session in week 1 will provide an introductory session, while the last session will consist of a debate that summarizes the course content.Student Learning Experience:Students will be taught in a weekly mix of seminar and lecture. In the lecture session, the course teacher will introduce the biblical texts, combining close readings with interactive elements. The seminar sessions will feature student-led discussions that focus on the theological problems. The course will be taught using a flipped classroom approach, so that the lecture will always introduce the biblical texts of the following week. This structure will allow the students to prepare the seminars with confidence.",

From covid through conspiracies to climate change, the apocalypse - from Greek apok\u00c3\u00a1lypsis, 'revelation' - is repeatedly referenced in contemporary culture. In this interdisciplinary course, we analyse and assess classic and current visions of the apocalypse. Concentrating on European and American contexts, we trace these visions throughout history, inquiring how factual and fictional accounts of the apocalypse shape our understanding of the world we live in today. Throughout, we aim to ask and answer how visions of the apocalypse determine our future by provoking either apathy or action.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:In this interdisciplinary course, we analyse and assess classic and current visions of the apocalypse. Approaching apocalypticism as a social and political imaginary that runs through Euroamerican history, we ask how visions of the end of the world shape contemporary culture. Religion is crucial to these visions. We draw on a variety of disciplines - reaching from natural sciences through the interpretation of film and fiction to cultural studies - to discuss how visions of the apocalypse determine our future. Which apocalyptic visions provoke apathy? Which apocalyptic visions provoke action? And how can we differentiate between them through a politics of envisioning the end of the world? By asking and answering questions like these, the course enables us to identify and interpret the apocalyptic imaginary in contemporary culture, thus showcasing the significance of interdisciplinary reflections on religion for understanding the world we live in today.Outline:Framed by 'Introduction' and 'Conclusion' that cover the emergence and the evolution of the study of apocalypticism in the academy, this course will (1) examine the roots of apocalypticism in classical sources, (2) explore the resonances of apocalypticism in contemporary sources, and (3) evaluate how classic and contemporary apocalypticisms shape our imagination of the future. Throughout, the sources are selected in conversation with the students taking the course.Student Learning Experience:The course is structured around a lecture of one hour that introduces students to the topic of the week. The lecture is complemented by a seminar session of one hour dedicated to the discussion of set texts or themes. These are chosen in conversation with students, showing the variety of visions of the end of the world in the past and the present. The seminar sessions include student presentations of around ten minutes with a view to initiating discussion. In addition to their presentation, students will be assessed by a final essay. Through these assessments, students will demonstrate the achievement of the learning outcomes of the course.",

    "summary": "This course explores, makes sense of, and problematises texts from the Hebrew Bible in light of contemporary issues. Each interpreter is shaped by his/her contemporary context, with its driving assumptions, concerns, and ideologies. With these in mind, students will interpret the Hebrew Bible from perspectives informed by modern views of e.g. gender, socio-economics, disability and ecology. Students will also examine the implications of these types of readings for theology, ethics and praxis.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:Hebrew Bible scholarship is becoming increasingly aware that every interpreter is situated in a context - social, economic, geographical - which inevitably affects their interpretation. Rather than ignoring these contexts, this course brings them to the fore. It draws on the growing literature in biblical studies of 'ideological criticism' and 'situated readings'. Students will analyse and critique hermeneutical stances informed by studies of e.g. gender, race, disability, socio-economics, ecology and animals. Students will apply these methods themselves, to a range of texts from the Hebrew Bible. These texts are first considered in their original contexts, and set against the practices, ideologies, and assumptions of the ancient world. They are then examined through these newer lenses. Students will also explore and reflect on the implications of this interpretation strategy, be they theological, ethical, or practical.Syllabus/Outline Content:The precise content and structure of the course may change in different years; what follows is an indicative breakdown. The course begins by considering how contemporary perspectives may shape our reading of biblical texts. Subsequently, several weeks each focalise a particular issue, e.g. gender, sexuality, ethnicity, class, disability, species, and ecology. Students analyse relevant biblical texts and discuss how these issues are considered in the contemporary and ancient worlds, bringing these perspectives into dialogue. The final weeks of the course broaden out to the implications of this type of reading for theology, ethics, and practice, and consider how biblical texts are used and abused in debates around contemporary justice causes.Student Learning Experience Information:Students are taught together with UG students in weekly 2-hour sessions. The teaching staff provide some lecture content (either pre-recorded or in class), and the bulk of the class time is devoted to interactive activities. Students may, for example, have a debate, lead a discussion, analyse a text, reflect on a piece of art, discuss with a partner. PG students will also receive an additional 1-hour seminar each week, where students will lead discussions of biblical texts and critical issues. Through the course, students write a series of short blog posts and a culminating essay to explore their ideas further.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This methodology course aims to investigate the manner in which fieldwork plays an important role in the study of religion. Some understanding of theoretical, ethical and practical aspects of fieldwork is essential for students engaging in research with people. Given that a focus on religion is common to all students in Divinity, and that research in this area faces some very particular issues, this course will enable undergraduate students especially but not only from Religious Studies and Practical Theology to gain the necessary competence and confidence. In order to achieve this, the course combines strong theoretical and practical discussion ranging from insider/outsider issues in the study of religion, alongside detailed classwork on participant observation, interview techniques, and writing up fieldwork notes. These debates will be carefully considered both in the lectures and the seminar discussions based on readings that are both empirically rich and theoretically innovative.Syllabus/Outline Content:The complexity and richness of the course will be illustrated through thematic considerations such as the importance of ethnographic methods, validity and reliability, the researcher as research tool. It will also look at issues surrounding religion, faith and praxis and how to approach group-based research in religion. More theoretical considerations will be examined through the insider/outsider problems in fieldwork, the geo-political dimensions of fieldwork in religion, and a practical way to conceptualise and plan a research project. It will finally consider the place the self in fieldwork and the wider colonial genealogies of (ethnographic) fieldwork in/of religion.Student Learning Experience Information:The course has a programme of two-hour weekly meetings consisting sometimes of one-hour weekly lectures, and one-hour seminar discussions. Because this is also a practical course that will involve individual and group work to design, implement and also do fieldwork, some of the sessions will not follow the traditional lecture-seminar model. The meetings will be interactive and will allow students to engage with the topic through lecture and seminar discussion. Through their participation in lectures, seminars, written work, final projects, and feedback offered, students will demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes.",

After reflecting on some key methodological issues - in particular the challenges of comparative analysis, including Orientalist influences - we will explore a number of categories, including scripture, theology, ritual, and politics. In each category, students will be exposed to (a) foundational knowledge and critical debates in the study of Islam and (b) how Christian-Muslim encounters (discourses/practices, dialogical/polemical engagements) have unfolded within each category. Throughout the course, we will accent the role of social context in shaping (and reshaping) both Islamic studies and Christian-Muslim relations.Syllabus/Outline Content:Five overarching themes will be explored, and both Islamic studies and Christian-Muslim relations will be engaged within each theme. While each bullet point does not necessarily represent a particular week / formal unit, over the duration of the course, all of these areas will be addressed.On Methodology:-\tThe promises and perils of the comparative method-\tIslamic Studies and the challenge of Orientalism-\tMethodological approaches to Christian-Muslim relationsScripture:-\tFoundations: Introduction to the Qur'an, Hadith, and Islamic texts-\tQur'anic representations of Jesus and Christianity-\tMuslim readings of the Bible / Christian readings of the Qur'an-\t'Traditional' approaches to Islamic texts and the impact of Biblical studies on modern Qur'anic hermeneuticsTheology and Philosophy:-       Foundations: classical debates about God's nature in Islamic theology-\tTheological discourses on God's unity, christology, and prophetology-\tPhilosophy, translation, and exchange in Christian-Muslim relationsAuthority, Ritual, and Gender:-\tFoundations: Introduction to Muslim ritual and liturgy-\tCase studies of syncretic, interreligious spaces of worship (eg: Christians and Muslims in Bethlehem, Palestine)-\tCommunity and consensus in Islamic thought - classical and contemporary approaches-\tChristian and Muslim debates on women, authority and leadershipIslam, Politics, and Christian-Muslim Relations:-\tFoundations: 'Political Islam' or 'Muslim Politics'?-\tContemporary Islamism and its impact on Christian-Muslim relations-\tCase studies of Christian-Muslim relations in modern contextsA Note on Teaching Format:The seminars will be in-person and all students are expected to have completed the weekly readings before the seminar. This preparation is essential because the seminars will be discussion-based, and students should be ready to engage the issues, questions, and perspectives raised in the readings. If any students need to self-isolate, the seminars will be streamed live (though not recorded).

    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionAs a field of study, public theology has expanded rapidly and evolved radically throughout the 20th and the 21st centuries. It involves scholars from different and diverse disciplines in discussions of issues that are stirring up controversy in what is commonly called 'the public square'. Particularly after events such as 9/11, theological language and theological literacy have taken on a new meaning. While the course concentrates on Christianity in its European and American contexts, it covers a variety of public theologies from around the world. By examining the emergence and the evolution of the field through its key thinkers and its key themes, the course seeks to enable students to evaluate and engage with theologies in the public square today both critically and constructively.OutlineThe course is organised around key thinkers and key themes in public theology. Framed by 'Introduction' and 'Conclusion' that cover the emergence and the evolution of the field, the course will(1)\texamine the inventions of public theology in sociological, philosophical, and theological scholarship on religion (in weeks 2 to 4),(2)\texplore the interpretations of public theology that have shaped the field throughout history (in weeks 5 to 7), and(3)\tevaluate the issues that are stirring up controversy in public theology today (in weeks 8 to 10).Student Learning ExperienceThe course is structured around a lecture of one hour that introduces students to the topic of the week. The lecture is complemented by a seminar session of one hour dedicated to the discussion of set texts. The texts are selected to show the spectrum of thinkers and themes studied in public theology. The seminar sessions include student presentations of around ten minutes with a view to initiating discussion. These presentations can cover either a classic public-theological publication or a current public-theological problem.In addition to their presentation in class, students will be assessed by an essay of 4000 words on a topic relevant to the field of public theology. Through these assessments, students will demonstrate the achievement of the learning outcomes of the course.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course enables students to engage with late medieval and Reformation theology and come to an informed conclusion about their complex relationship.  It does so through contextual readings of a wide variety of theological texts (in translation) from the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries.  The late medieval texts have been chosen to provide a graduated introduction to key theological terms and issues, as well as to illustrate a diversity of perspectives.  The Reformation texts develop these themes and pay close attention to the transformation of traditional theological concepts (e.g. grace, justification).  They have been chosen, where possible, to offer explicit engagement with key debates of the Late Middle Ages, as well as sixteenth-century concerns.  In this way the narrative of reform in both the Late Middle Ages and Reformation is presented as one of complex interconnections and intersections.Syllabus/Outline Content:See below for a prospective outline (precise topics subject to change from year to year).  The course will begin with an introduction to late medieval theology, its method and dynamic.  From here it will move on to a consideration of important late medieval theological debates and their connections to reform.  It will then seek to trace these debates into the various Reformations of the sixteenth century and assess their impact.  Primary texts will be chosen, where possible, to illustrate contrasting theological voices and secondary texts will help to facilitate a contextual understanding.  These will address writings across the reform spectrum, from a variety of genres, including works by male and female mystics and from the milieu of the Radical Reformation:Week 1: Theology after 1277Week 2: Scripture, Realism and Radical ReformWeek 3: Conciliarism and the Dispute over AuthorityWeek 4: Mysticism and the Modern DevotionWeek 5: The Augustinian Revival and Modern PelagianismWeek 6: Christian Humanism and Neo-PlatonismWeek 7: Beyond the Medieval SynthesisWeek 8: Justification ContestedWeek 9: Predestination, Grace and FreedomWeek 10: Scripture, Church and TheologyWeek 11: Signs, Sacraments and the (Dis)enchanted WorldStudent Learning Experience Information:Each two-hour seminar will, typically, include teaching from the course organiser, student presentations and class discussion. Students' preparatory reading of primary and secondary sources will enable contextual, comparative discussion in tutorials of their major themes and their impact on wider currents of reform.The structure for the course is both (roughly) chronological and thematic. The readings have been designed to allow for graduated progression through the topics. In addition there is a certain mirroring of late medieval and Reformation themes, allowing students to examine first-hand continuities and discontinuities between the two periods. Both course teaching and preparatory reading will help students to place intellectual and theological developments in their wider social, political and ecclesiological contexts. Students will be offered formative feedback on their presentations and an essay plan.",

    "summary": "This course aims to build a theologically-informed view of the modern scientific enterprise and its impact on contemporary areas of debate in Christian theology, such as creation, divine action, eschatology, and human identity/purpose. The course is designed to complement the two core courses of the Philosophy, Science, Religion programme (PSR1: The Physical World, and PSR2: Life and Mind), but it is also available as a stand-alone option to students enrolled on other programmes.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:The course focuses on contemporary theological questions in the science-and-religion field, and includes in-depth critical attention to some of the most characteristic key theologians working in the area. The course is largely based within the context of Christian theology, but other religious traditions may be included as appropriate. The course looks at the nature and shape of the scientific disciplines from a theistic perspective - including the vexed area of 'scientific method' - and examines theological answers to debates around the unity and disunity of the sciences. This will allow for detailed models of the relationship between the sciences and theology to be built. Attention will also be given to important areas of Christian doctrine that are relevant to the scientific enterprise, such as creation, providence, Christology and eschatology.Outline Content:The course is broken up into three main parts. The first attempts to answer the question of, 'What is theology of science?' by looking at the nature of the contemporary scientific landscape and the ways in which Christian theology and religious perspectives have influenced its historical evolution, as well as ways in which theism may illuminate its open questions now. For instance, debates about the boundary between science and metaphysics (in the multiverse hypothesis) clarify the relationship between philosophy, science, and religion. Important areas of Christian doctrine appear in passing in the first part of the course (especially creation, eschatology and Christology), but the second part of the course looks in detail at specific areas. One particular area of interest is that of divine action, perhaps the single-most significant and enduring theological question raised by the modern sciences, namely is it still possible to affirm the doctrine of providence in light of scientific perspectives on creation and eschatology? The third part of the course takes the themes of the first two parts further by looking at the thought of specific theological thinkers and 'scientist-theologians' in depth, including some of the following: Pannenberg, Moltmann, Murphy, Eddington, Coulson, Coakley, Peacocke and Polkinghorne.Student Learning Experience:The course is taught by means of eleven online modules, each of which includes core content presented by one of the course teachers, and opportunity for online class discussion. Except for the very first module, each week requires a schedule of reading to be carried out in advance. Students are expected to engage critically with the reading, and to contribute to online discussion.",

It will address questions like 'What are we trying to sustain?' 'What does it mean to 'save' the planet?' The second part of the course will investigate theology and the non-biological sciences of climate change.

The third and final part of the course will look at possible theological responses to the possibility of unstoppable climate change. This part of the course will look at possible responses shaped by theology to the prospect of inevitable climate change. Themes include facing death and loss, creating radical hope and hospitality, and the possibilities of action.Student Learning Experience:The course will be taught through weekly two-hour courses, for which essential reading will need to be completed. Students will be evaluated through a summative essay and an oral presentation in class, usually on a required reading.

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This is a postgraduate core course dealing with theoretical issues and methodological approaches relevant to the academic study of religion. It provides an overview of various ways of studying religion, reviews the history of the development of comparative religion, introduces students to recent developments in the study of religion and raises issues that confront scholars of religion. In order to achieve this, the course combines strong theoretical and practical discussion ranging from the historical formation of the discipline, key dates in religious studies, alongside more thematic approaches such as text-historical, narrative studies, anthropological, and cultural. These debates will be carefully considered in the seminar discussions based on readings that are both empirically rich and theoretically innovative.Syllabus/Outline Content:The complexity and richness of the course will be illustrated through thematic considerations such as the importance of religious studies both in its historical and contemporary context. It will start by offering a more historical focus on the formation of the discipline, using key texts and thinkers in the field. It will then offer a nuanced approach to some of the ways religious studies have developed ranging from text-historical, and narrative methods, sociological and anthropological ideas of focusing on human societies that examine the role of materiality, economy, and politics, cultural and historical methods that emphasise the centrality of cultural history and memory, to more recent debates on the cognitive science of religion.Student Learning Experience Information:The course has a programme of two-hour weekly meetings which may vary in organisation. Class may consist of one-hour weekly lecture and one-hour seminar discussions, be more discussion based, and/or include student presentations that structure and/or feed in to lecture or discussion. The meetings will be interactive and will allow students to engage actively. Through their participation in lectures/seminars, written work, final essays, and feedback offered, students will demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course explores the branch of Buddhism known as Theravada, which is prevalent in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, aiming to give students a thorough understanding of the major beliefs, practices and historical developments as well as allow more in-depth study of selected themes. The course covers the origins of Buddhism, the development of Theravada as a distinct branch, the history of Theravada, and key aspects of Theravada Buddhist thought and practice. Students are expected to engage directly with primary sources, both textual and ethnographic, and to reflect upon the nature of these types of sources within the academic study of Buddhism.Syllabus/Outline Content:This course begins with the beginnings of Theravada Buddhism, by exploring Theravada representations of the life of the Buddha and traditional understandings of Theravada history and identity. It then discusses key Buddhist ideas in their Theravada formulations, the notion of scripture and the compilation of the 'Pali canon', monasticism as the basic Theravada institution, meditation, ethics, ritual and devotional practices, and the role of Theravada Buddhism in national identity and political debate. Throughout the course students are encouraged to explore variations in Theravada perspectives, as well as to question both traditional and academic representations of Theravada Buddhism.Student Learning Experience Information:The course is paired with REST10048, and shares a two-hour class per week with that course. One hour is usually a traditional lecture format, albeit with interactive elements and an emphasis on student engagement with primary sources. The other hour is a seminar discussion of the set reading for the week, which will usually be either a scriptural extract or an ethnographic account. Students are expected to read the set seminar readings and produce a weekly short written response that gives a brief summary of the source, picks out one or two points of interest and raises a question for discussion; these weekly responses are combined to form 20% of the course mark. Students are also expected to follow up recommended readings relating to lecture themes. In addition to the shared class time, students on REST11021 will have four additional seminars with the CM, exploring more advanced readings and extra topics, as decided at the beginning of the semester. A 4,000 word essay on a topic devised by the student in conversation with the CM will form 80% of the summative assessment, while formative assessment is provided through feedback on essay plans and annotated bibliographies.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description:This course explores the two great Hindu epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Using English retellings and secondary scholarship it will examine the key characters and plots, and relate them to wider Hindu debates and ideas. It will also pose questions about the reception of the epics, and their role in Hindu and Indian religious history. The two epics are dated, in their classical Sanskrit versions, to around the 4th century BCE to 4th century CE, thus falling in an important period of Hindu development. As the old Vedic culture that dominated the Northwest of India is challenged by the new religious movements of the Northeast - namely Buddhism and Jainism - a new form of Hinduism begins to emerge. Karma and rebirth is incorporated into the ideology, and new paths to liberation become the focus of religious activity, while the dominant teachings continue to emphasise the importance of fulfilling one's worldly duties. Meanwhile, devotional traditions surrounding key deities such as Visnu, start to develop and rise in popularity. The Mahabharata and Ramayana are key contributors to this exciting religious scene, with their teachings about the nature of gods, the obligations of humans, and the cosmic battle between good and evil. Developing into multiple versions in multiple languages, the epics are also a window into the changing religious landscape of India.Syllabus/Outline Content:After an introductory week that introduces key historical and thematic considerations, the course is broadly split into two halves: in the first half of the semester we focus on the Mahabharata, and in the second half on the Ramayana. We will read key episodes from the epics in English translation, and discussion of these will be accompanied by lectures on related themes and questions. The two are tied together at the end of the semester with a discussion of key common features and distinctive elements.Student Learning Experience Information:The course will be delivered through a weekly two-hour class, which will be a mixture of lecture and seminar discussion and will run concurrently with the level 10 version of the course. In addition, the PGT students will meet for four extra seminars with the Course Organiser, based around more advanced readings on variant traditions and reception history. Weekly written responses to primary source readings will serve as both formative and summative assessment, with comments on these pieces returned to students prior to the subsequent week's class; together the weekly work counts for 20% of the grade. The remaining assessment (80%) is a 4,000 word essay on a topic agreed between the student and the CO. An overview /plan for the coursework essay will be presented to other PGT students during a session in week 11, allowing for feedback from peers and the CO. Written feedback will also be given on essay plans.",

The changes brought about in early ninth-century Japan by the activities of two monks in particular, Saich\u00c2\u00bf (767-822) and K\u00c2\u00bfkai (774-835) will be treated in some detail, as they provide, through contrasting interaction with ritsury\u00c2\u00bf norms, intriguing illustrations of the role of  ideology and cosmology in government.In the background are the standards of government exemplified by Tang China and the relations developed and nurtured by the prominent sovereign states of East Asia. An analysis of the religio-political implications of Saich\u00c2\u00bf's petitions for adoption of the Mahayana precepts and of K\u00c2\u00bfkai's introduction of Esoteric Buddhism will give students a focal point for understanding the importance of cosmology and ontology in the religio-political matrix.The course begins with an examination of the political aspects of the eastward spread of Buddhism and the integration of Buddhism into the Tang state. Attention is also given to the place of translating the Buddhist scriptures into Chinese (Xuan Zang) and the technology of Esoteric Buddhism (Amoghavajra); Japanese embassies to China and the Chinese influence on the first Japanese state; and a detailed consideration of the eighth-century Japanese capital Nara, which in turn entails an analysis of the state, its cosmology, its Buddhism and its material culture. The careers and writings of Saich\u00c2\u00bf and K\u00c2\u00bfkai from the late eighth century are looked at in detail, including Saich\u00c2\u00bf's Mah\u00c2\u00bfy\u00c2\u00bfna precepts and his debates with the Nara establishment, and K\u00c2\u00bfkai's rise to political and religious prominence, espeically his expansive writings on cosmos and the state. The course will also provide opportunity for summative reflections on Buddhism and the polity in comparative perspective.",

    "summary": "Herod ruled Judea, on traditional dating, from 40 - 4 BCE: a time of international transition. The Hellenistic era came to an end (30 BCE) in the face of Rome's supremacy, and the Roman state was itself revolutionised into the Augustan principate. So how does the king of Judaea, a territory on the periphery of Augustus' empire, fit in to this picture? This course will examine Herod's reign to elucidate the paradoxes and complexities of a monarchy that draw on Hellenistic traditions in a Jewish context under Roman rule.",
    "course_description": "The story of Herod the Great (c. 73-4 BCE) is a gripping one that can be told from various angles. One story might focus on politics: Herod came to the throne in unusual circumstances and went on to oversee the transition of the Southern Levant from Hellenisticto Roman rule, walking a thin line between obedience to Roman overlords and opposition from local stakeholders. Another story might concentrate on identity: Herod's father was an Idumean, his mother a Nabatean, and yet he became king of the Jews - an unprecedented and far from uncontroversial appointment that challenged the very notion of what it meant to be Jewish. A third story could trace reception: we are uniquely well-informed about Herod through the writings of Flavius Josephus, but these already presuppose decades of (often unfavourable) reception and reinterpretation of Herod's reign - and if Herod is famous until this day, this is largely due to his role in the Christian nativity legend. What makes the study of Herod's reign challenging is that all these stories and more are inextricably linked.Based on textual sources and an ever-growing body of material evidence, this course will examine recent trends in Herodian research through a number of case studies. The course is not biographically oriented: students are expected to familiarise themselves with the life of Herod early in the course, e.g. through reading one of the many biographies published recently. The course then highlights individual episodes (such as Herod's staging of gladiatorial games in Jerusalem), bodies of evidence (such as Herod's coins) or buildings (such as Herodium) to elucidatethe paradoxes and complexities of monarchy in a Jewish context under Roman rule. Students will learn to reflect critically on scholarly categories (what is \"Hellenistic\", \"Roman\", or \"Jewish\"?), ancient historiographical sources, and identity politics (both ancient and modern).",

This came at the end of a war that began in 66 CE, at around the time of the momentous events in Rome that led to the rise of the Flavians. Indeed, this victory became vitally important to the new dynasty in Rome, who capitalized on its import to justify the new regime. But what led to the rebellion in the first place? The history of Roman-Jewish relations prior to this point appears far from a catalogue of antipathy and conflict and the reasons for such a dramatic eruption of violence remain a point of contention today.This course tackles the history of Judaea under Roman rule, concentrating on the period from Pompey's conquest of the East in 63 BCE until the momentous events of 70 CE, when the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed, never to be rebuilt.

This will then allow us to compare these metaphysical interpretations of scientific theories to interpretations of religious text as complementary or competing strategies for making sense of the world around us.Philosophical work on laws of nature, causation, naturalism and related topics will be introduced to help facilitate the discussion and to provide students with advanced tools to engage in debates concerning particular scientific theories.",

It also provides a historical perspective on pre-modern artistic traditions which are being maintained and pursued in contemporary Japan. It also provides a window on the permutations of a philosophy which is deeply embedded in Japanese society.",

    "course_description": "Roman imperial rulers had to deal with the very different backgrounds of their various subjects, and provincials in turn adapted or resisted the coming of Rome in a variety of ways. The situation of Jews outside of their Judaean homeland is a particularly fascinating case in point within this broader picture. Jewish communities were spread very widely across the empire, meaning that many Jews lived side by side with their pagan and later their Christian neighbours. What was the extent and nature of the impact of this on their identity? The course will cover the sources and history of the Jewish diaspora under Rome up to c. 450 C.E., considering both the eastern and western empire, as well as the community in Rome itself. Students will consider the position and lives of Jews as a case study for the impact of empire on subject communities, but will also evaluate the extent to which we can indeed use this particular case as a representative example. Regional case studies will provide an in-depth knowledge of particular areas, though students be expected to master a wide range of sources from across the empire: pagan, Jewish and Christian literature, inscriptions, papyri and archaeological material.",

    "summary": "The Maccabaean Revolt is one of the most important events of Hellenistic history. And yet everything about the \"religious persecution\" of 168 BC and Maccabaean resistance to it is debated - what happened, who was responsible, and why? This course discusses recent advances made in Historical and Archaeological scholarship that elucidate both the events themselves and the context in which they unfolded.",
    "course_description": "The traditional narrative surrounding the Maccabaean Revolt is fairly simple. A Greek king wanted to eradicate Judaism, but the Jews, led by the heroic Maccabees, fought back and prevailed. This story still has its uses in modern foundation myths, but it has long been argued that things were in fact much more complex. The motivations of Antiochus IV on the one hand and the resistance fighters of the other have been interpreted in various ways, leading to wildly different conceptions of the whole sequence of events. New narratives have recently been published that call into question the very reality of the persecution, and give completely different accounts of the real reasons for the revolt. While no new consensus is in sight, a number of new finds - inscriptions, archaeological remains, previously unrecognized parallels elsewhere - shed important light on this crucial moment in Hellenistic history. Focusing on a very limited timespan (ca. 200 to 152 BC), this course explores how recent advances and old insights can help to understand the events in their historical context.",
