But how do we know if these programmes are working? Should we continue to fund them if they are not effective, and even if they are effective, how can they be improved and made more efficient? Furthermore, how do leaders, organisations or communities make decisions about the best interventions, out of a range of promising programmes, for their contexts? In resource constrained environments, this is even more important.This twenty credit module explores what evaluation is, when it can be used and the range of evaluations and methods. It aims to provide students with the knowledge and skills to design an evaluation of a public health or development programme taking into account specific contexts. Case studies will be used to illustrate concepts.The module would particularly benefit health and development programme managers, researchers and practitioners.

This course will critically engage with healthy ageing as a major global challenge faced by high, low and middle income countries. The core aim of the course is for students to develop a sophisticated appreciation of how healthy ageing is dependent not only on individual lifestyles and histories, but also on structural, population and environmental levels factors, which shape people's vulnerability to poor health and their resilience in maintaining health as they age.",
    "course_description": "This twenty-credit course will enable students to develop critical awareness, knowledge and skills to more effectively address the multiple challenges occurring as a result of global population ageing and global shifts in the health of the aged that are occurring in response to economic development and its unevenness across the globe.Case studies of different country examples and specific issues central to healthy ageing will be used to illustrate the differences and commonalities of key challenges in healthy ageing globally. The course will explore different practices of healthy ageing from varied (but interconnected) approaches, including health promotion, service delivery, policy and advocacy. By completion of the course, students will have developed a complex understanding of the significance and complexity of global ageing, and will be able to distinguish between the challenges in healthy ageing occurring in low, middle and high income contexts.Over ten weeks, the course will address the following themes:1) the implications of global demographic and epidemiological transitions for ageing populations and the associated health system challenges;2) chronic conditions and ageing;3) ageing and mental health;4) inequities over the life course and implications for equitable health outcomes for aged people;5) mobilities and ageing populations;6) health finance and health workforce challenges in response to ageing populations;7) health promotion and secondary prevention for healthy ageing;8) service delivery, information systems and long-term care for healthy ageing;9) access to and appropriate use of medicines and assistive devices;and 10) policy, leadership and governance that respond to ageing populations.",

    "summary": "This introductory global health course will equip students with an understanding of how the health of the world's population has changed over time, how and why it might change in future and what might be done to influence these trajectories.  A recurring theme throughout the course is that essentially the same global drivers are responsible for the health risks faced by populations in both high and middle/low income countries.  The stark differences in health outcomes in high income compared with middle/low income countries is not primarily a reflection of different risks but of differences in the capacity to prevent or respond to these risks.  The field of global health is a constantly and rapidly changing one, so the focus of this course is not simply to teach students about current global health priorities but rather to equip them with the skills and knowledge to assess and critically appraise global health evidence so that they can become effective decision-makers and problem-solvers.",
    "course_description": "This course is organised into five weekly sessions.  Sessions 1 to 4 cover the topics listed below.  The final session is for student group presentations and feedback.  The four preceding sessions are:1.\tWhat is global health? This session examines the concept of global health and how this has evolved over the last 70 years or so.  We consider evolving global health governance arrangements.2.\tMeasuring global health: We look at how different types of global health issue can be measured and at the inherent challenges involved.  We introduce and briefly critique the global burden of disease approach and look at what this tells us about evolving global health issues.  We also consider the concept of globalisation and global drivers of health and disease.3.\tHealth inequity: We introduce the concept of health inequity and the seminal work of Sir Michael Marmot.  We look at tools for assessing the equity impact of public health interventions and different health system arrangements.4.\tGender and health: We focus on gender as one form of inequity and introduce a tool for analysing the impact of gender on disease and disease outcomes.The final week of the course is devoted to student presentations, which constitutes 40% of the summative assessment for this course.  Students are divided into three groups and present the results of their enquiries into:1. Communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional diseases2. Noncommunicable diseases3. Injuries and violenceThese enquiries cover an analysis of the magnitude/global burden of the issue, the underlying causes/drivers, the identification of risk factors and at-risk populations/groups and a critical analysis of global initiatives and evidence-based interventions to address the issue.

Underlying approaches will be examined and then different methods will be looked at in more detail. Practical components will be incorporated into the course, such as carrying out in-depth interviews and participating in class exercises and discussions. Students will be expected to do background reading on the topics. Students will also learn how to analyse qualitative data, what some of the challenges of mixing methods are and how to appraise published qualitative research.",

It can help us to understand how people experience different aspects of that social world and how they respond to it i.e. what they feel, think and do.Understanding experiences and behaviour in a way that is embedded in social reality is essential to public health practice. People are the subject of public health and qualitative research aims to better understand people as individuals who are situated in, and influenced by, their social context.Our aim during this introductory course is for you to understand the core ideas, processes and activities underpinning the qualitative approach to researching the social world and for you to be able to identify aspects of rigour and quality in studies carried out by other researchers. This knowledge will allow you to critically appraise and use qualitative research in relation to public health practice and provides a grounding for further study of qualitative methods during the MPH programme.",

However, the migration process itself can expose migrants to social, physical and psychological risks, and result in infringements of their human rights, including limited access to health care.This ten-credit course will enable students to develop critical awareness, knowledge, and skills to better tackle complex challenges that occur as a result of migration.  The course will be available to students taking the PG Certificate in Global Health Challenges, and Master of Public Health and potentially from other programmes.  Students will be introduced to the concepts, drivers, types, and the ethical and health challenges of migration.  Case studies will be used to understand migration within and between countries in different contexts.  Approaches and strategies to address the challenges will be explored.  By the end of the course, students will have developed an awareness of the complexities that migration presents, and some related strategies to use in their own professional and practice environments.",

    "course_description": "This course will explore the nexus of climate change and health with a particular focus on infectious disease.  Changes in rainfall and temperature with the resultant pressures on water availability, food security, biodiversity and the increase in incidence of natural disasters have changed the infectious disease landscape significantly over the previous decade, significantly challenging infectious disease control and health care system resilience.We will initially explore these challenges with examples that are related to the specific ways in which climate change is expanding the ranges of multiple disease vectors and thus increasing the zoonotic risks and re/emergence of infectious disease. Both zoonotic and animal diseases will be utilised as examples, the latter more so to highlight and explore the nexus in respect to the impact of climate change on food production and foodborne infectious disease. The increased risks of water-based pathogens especially in the context of water security and climate change will also be included.It is essential to consider and recognise the transdisciplinary nature of these issues, so we can then explore the wider relationships of infectious disease, climate related migration and of the emergence of infectious disease.As well detailing the current and contemporary issues associated with the health and infectious disease sequalae of climate change and extreme weather events, this course will explore the challenges of addressing the impacts climate change has on infectious disease control, as well as explore the actionable areas in which the effect of climate change on health, infectious disease control could be mitigated, and public health resilience strengthened.",

The course will introduce good practice in data management and key skills in exploratory and inferential statistical analysis, using the open source R statistical programming language.  Topics to be covered include numerical and graphical descriptive methods, simple one and two sample comparisons of categorical and continuous data using both confidence intervals and hypothesis tests, contingency tables and risk ratios, direct and indirect standardisation, correlation and simple linear regression as an introduction to general linear models.The course (delivered online) will be based around 5 weekly case studies/ projects that will require students to undertake software-based analyses after using a mix of short recorded lectures and readings designed to illustrate each set of principles, with each week's activity building on the last. Each week, students will be encouraged to discuss their analysis plans, share useful code 'shortcuts' and discuss their results on the discussion boards. The case studies will be based on real epidemiological data sets and/ or common problems, although the principles will be applicable more broadly across a wide range of medical and scientific research.",

    "summary": "This ten credit course provides students with an introductory overview of health policy in public health. Students are introduced to what health policy is, its role, importance and diversity. A health policy framework is used to analyse the context, content, actors and processes involved in policy making. This framework allows students to examine the context in which policy is made; the technical content of the policy itself; the actors involved in shaping policy, such as the state, the private sector and interest groups; and theories to explain why a policy does or does not move from conception, to implementation, and evaluation. By the end of the course, students will have an awareness of the complexities of policy making, and some strategies to use in their own policy environments.",
    "course_description": "This course emphasizes some of the key objectives in public health of population health improvement and the reduction of health inequalities. It introduces students to the crucial role of the state in this endeavor and the variety of approaches available to governments within and outside of the health system. The course reviews the range of factors that influence individual and population health, with an emphasis on social determinants of community health and wellbeing. It explores: What is 'healthy' public policy? Why is it important? What are the justice and human rights aspects of this? What is the role of health policy in health reducing inequalities? Students are provided with a conceptual framework within which to understand and analyse the making of health policy and to plan the evaluation of health policies which they can apply to different contexts.This is a 5-week distance learning course worth 10 credits.  Students are expected to spend 20 hours per week on this course.  Students will be given a brief overview of the course and will then be provided with relevant materials and resources. Specific individual and collaborative tasks and online discussion exercises relating to each week's topic will be set. This will culminate in a written assignment at the end of the course.",

    "course_description": "1)\tAcademic descriptionThis course provides students with an introduction to qualitative methods, as used in the study of health and health policy. The introduction to the course focuses on basic epistemology, and particularly aims to encourage students to consider the link between research questions/aims, methods, and forms of analysis. Following this, each week of the course introduces a set of related research methods which can be used to capture or interrogate a single form of data. Upon completion of the course, students will gain a familiarity with various qualitative approaches to research, have practiced aspects of these approaches within workshops, and have considered ethical and practical implications of qualitative research in relation to questions posed in the health policy field.2)\tOutline content or syllabus-\tDoing Research  This week focuses on: (1) Constructing health policy research questions and (2) How to find the appropriate research method for your question.-\tText:  This week examines approaches to analysing textual data, allowing students to recognise the uses of documentary sources and understand and apply various documentary analysis techniques.-\tPolicy:  This week focuses on understanding and applying different forms of policy analysis.-\tTalk: This week involves understanding approaches to interviews and focus groups within health and health policy settings.-\tObservation and Evaluation: This week examines approaches to (participant) observation and/or qualitative approaches to the evaluation of health programmes, policies, or intervention.3)\tStudent learning experienceThis course is run in a flipped classroom set-up. For weeks 2 to 5, students will attend each 2hr workshop session having engaged with the online materials (lecture and sometimes short activity, plus reading related to workshop). This work takes the place of the introductory lecture for each week. In the workshop session itself, every week will differ, with each activity aimed at deepening understanding of the weeks method (e.g. a discourse analysis of part of a policy document, a paired activity where students mock interview each other on a general topic etc.).From this, students will gain an understanding of the variety of qualitative research methods and potential data sources available to them, insights into the types of research questions such methods/data can address, an awareness of practical and ethical issues associated with various forms of research, and an understanding of where to access further information on methodological approaches when needed.",

    "summary": "This course provides a comprehensive and multi-faceted understanding of societal issues in 'reproductive health' - family formation, sexuality, and sexual health/well being. A multi-disciplinary approach is needed because reproductive and well-being/health outcomes intersect in numerous ways with: relationships (intimate, family and community), socio-economic position/setting; society (legislative and cultural context); contraceptive technology; and health service provision.[Pregnancy and birth will not be covered since there is a pre-existing 10-credit course in Maternal Health (GLHE11014)]",
    "course_description": "Reproduction is the natural process by which humans are brought into the world, but it is shaped by social factors, as are sex, conception and childbirth. 'Reproductive wellbeing' is broader than reproduction, encompassing also: strategies to prevent unwanted pregnancy/birth; feelings arising in the course of sexual behaviours (even where there is certainty, or hope, that reproduction will not follow); sexual orientation/identity; and infections that are transmitted sexually. Thus health policy and health service provision can impact on reproductive well-being.Reproductive/sexual behaviour encompasses many types of human interactions ranging from:  enduring intimate relationships to fleeting encounters, mutually negotiated to abusive and coercive, enhancing social and individual well-being to causing distress and often long-term harm.The course will apply theories and methods used in understanding and interpreting global health, focussing on the determinants that shape reproductive health/wellbeing, and issues of inequality and inequity.  Topics include the intersection of reproduction and reproductive rights with gender and gender identity and other social divisions; the expression of reproductive right in national legislation and health policy.",

    "summary": "Big data refers to the use of data science techniques to capture, share, manage and analyse vast and complex datasets. Big data is challenging in health and social care not only because of its volume, but also because of the diversity of data types and the speed at which data is generated. There are many applications for big data in health and social care including genomics, imaging, Internet of things (IoT) and wearables, and population studies.This course aims to introduce students to the fundamental principles of big data and how big data is being applied in health and social care, and equip students with the knowledge appreciation of the challenges associated with and the and skills to analyse to big data.This course is designed for students who are interested in big data analytics and wish to understand how to analyse big data using R programming language in the health and social care context. Prior knowledge of basic statistics concepts, data handling and analysis with R and best data management and coding practice is required.",
    "course_description": "1) Academic descriptionBig data in health, social and care services is a term used to describe the large volumes of data created by the adoption of digital technologies that collect service users and administrative records that are used in the management of care systems. Big data in health, social and care services is used for improving service user care and wellbeing, and the management of care systems, care services and data security. Big data challenges include data ethics, capture, storage, analysis, sharing, and visualisation and information privacy.JupyterHub is an environment to store and manage, and analyse data in R.2)\tCourse outlineIn this course, we introduce the fundamental principles and unique challenges of big data. The course will introduce parallel computing and its implementation for big data analytics. The course will then explore techniques and algorithms for big data analytics including traditional statistical models such as linear and logistic regression, as well as machine learning models such as neural networks.Students will also be introduced to using sparklyr in a JupyterHub environment for big data analytics in R.3)\tStudent Learning ExperienceStudents will learn from experts in implementation science. The course is delivered online and is divided into five sessions, each lasting a week. Teaching sessions will be composed of written materials and video presentations, accompanied by guided reading in the form of links to journal articles with problem-based learning questions.Discussion boards will be created to give the students the opportunity to interactively and collaboratively solve problems, as well as ask questions of the instructors. Course tutors will moderate discussion boards. Students will evidence their learning by carrying out their own big data analysis by the end of the course.Formative peer and teacher-led feedback and feedforward will be given throughout the course through the discussion boards, and summative assessment feedback and feedforward will be provided during and at the end of the course.",

Lack of interoperability results in service users receiving suboptimal services, impairs the management of services within and across health, social and care service systems, and limits data access for research and service development.An important technology that has increased interoperability is the emergence of health and social services application programming interfaces (APIs).  An API is a set of data standards that govern how software applications communicate so that data in one component of the health and social services system is accessible and meaningful across a wide range of health and social services information systems.

    "summary": "This course provides an introduction to data types and structures in health, social and care service settings. This course is designed to equip students with the skills required to handle, analyse and create tools to manage different data types and structures. Concepts are illustrated with examples from health, social and care services.The course makes minimal assumptions about students' previous data use, the management or programming experience. This course is a stepping stone into more advanced programming and software development courses.",
    "course_description": "1) Academic descriptionHealth, social, and care service systems collect and process many data types that support shared decision making and optimal service delivery and provision.A data type is the most basic classification of data. It is the data type through which the computer program gets to know the form or the type of information that will be used. Data is stored differently depending on its type. Numbers are stored as integers or real numbers, text as string or characters.A data structure is a collection of data types. Data structures provide a means to manage large volumes of data for use in health, social and care service institutions. Within a data structure, data is better organised. Efficient data structures are vital for obtaining maintainable software design. Some examples of data structures are arrays, linked lists, graphs and binary trees.Software applications designed for problem-solving purposes require data to be stored as particular data types within certain data structures so that data operations yield specific results. The more common programming languages define data types such as 'integers' (whole numbers, for example, 33), 'non-integers' (numbers with decimal points, for example, 0.33) and 'characters' (text). They also have standard libraries that implement the most common data structures.Much data manipulation and analysis can be undertaken without an in-depth understanding of computer science. Functional code and basic programs can be written without expertise in computer science or software engineering. However, data scientists working in health, social and care services will ultimately need to move beyond writing simple code and using others' applications. Understanding how data is represented in computer systems and manipulated with programming languages will benefit people writing code that runs fast, scales to large amounts of data, and is portable to other platforms. This course will introduce students to foundational computer science concepts, the data life cycle, and data management and coding best practices.Understanding data types and structures, how data is represented in computer systems and best data management and programming practices, and the context from which data is derived, is crucial for data scientists working in health, social and care services.This course is designed to equip students with the skills required to realise the values of data and apply best practice, manipulate, analyse, and present data from health data social and care service settings.2) Course outlineThe course focuses on the different data types and structures. The course will first introduce data types, such as numerical and time series, textual and unstructured data, the data life cycle and best data management practices. Implementation of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, graphs and binary trees, the advantages and disadvantages of their use will be covered. The course will compare and contrast these concepts programming in R and Python.3) Student Learning ExperienceStudents will learn from data handling experts. The course is delivered online and is divided into five sessions, each lasting a week. Teaching sessions will be composed of written materials and video presentations, accompanied by guided reading in the form of links to journal articles with problem-based learning questions.Discussion of the content and reading materials will be posted to an online forum, along with students' answers to the problem-based learning questions. Course tutors will moderate discussion boards.Formative peer and teacher-led feedback will be given throughout the course through the discussion boards, and summative assessment feedback will be provided at the end of the course.",

    "course_description": "Data security is concerned with protecting analogue and digital information systems and personal data from threats that may compromise integrity, availability, or confidentiality. The effective delivery of health, social, and care services requires collecting, processing, and exchanging sensitive service user data. Therefore, the health, social and care services sector is subject to stricter guidelines on the collection, processing, and storage of individuals' data than other sectors. Safeguarding this information's security is a significant legal responsibility for health, social, and care service organisations and individual health, social, and care service professionals. Recent incidents of personal data loss and breaches of confidential healthcare information reinforced the requirement for all health, social, and care service professionals to be aware of their responsibilities under the law in safeguarding sensitive service user data. Therefore, it is essential for practitioners working in health, social, and care services to understand their responsibilities regarding data security fully.Course outlineThe course will introduce data security principles and examine their application in the health, social and care services sector. In later weeks, the course will focus on regulatory requirements and data security best practices. Finally, the course will explore data security risk and attacks and data security from a global perspective.Experts in the field will explore the practical aspects of data security with students, including threats and vulnerabilities. Students will analyse real-world examples from the health and social care sector to get a better understanding of data security fundamentals, data security standards, threats, risk assessment, and data security technologies.",

    "summary": "Data visualisation, in general terms, is a tangible representation of data that provides an accessible means for analysing, understanding, and communicating the trends, outliers, and patterns of data for and across sectors and audiences. This course explores the communication of data relevant to health, social and care services settings through visualisations for exploration, analysis and related communication media. Visualisation can be a powerful means of sharing and communicating service user data to a range of audiences, such as driving policy development or improving stakeholder or broader public understanding. The course will explore theory, application, design and evaluation techniques that can be used to visualise and accessibly communicate data in various ways, such as combining vignettes taken from individual stories with data derived from official sources such as government statistics. Students will be introduced to several global projects that communicate health, social, and care services data in this way and will have the opportunity to develop their small data visualisation project.",
    "course_description": "With data volumes increasing exponentially, an increasing focus on interdisciplinary approaches to complex problems, and an ever more tech-savvy general public, those working in health, social and care services can no longer rely solely on data presentation tools such as spreadsheets and tables. Data visualisation gives organisations and individuals the means to share important information, sometimes in real-time, by telling data stories. Data visualisation curates data into a form that is accessible and which can more easily highlight current utilisation, trends and outliers. Well curated data visualisation will allow individuals and organisations to tell a story. Unlike more traditional data representation forms, data visualisation aims to remove the noise from data and highlights usable information. This course will enable students to describe a visualisation problem within target users and global environments, explore the data visualisation, discuss and design appropriate and accessible visualisation concepts, and implement and critically reflect on their own and other's designs.Outline ContentThe course will introduce the value of data visualisation in the health, social and care services context. Next, the course will focus on the data visualisation design process and data visualisation tools and techniques. Finally, effective communication and reporting using data visualisation will be covered.",

The SLICC framework requires that students use the generic learning outcomes to articulate their learning in their own defined project, reflect frequently using a blog, collect, formulate, organise and present evidence of their learning in an e-portfolio. Students will receive relevant formative feedback on a draft final report, which is the same format as the final reflective report, which forms the summative assessment. The above will be with guidance of a mentor.The course will encourage critical appraisal of students' own practical experiences, and allow them to reflect on their learning in the context of the cross-disciplinary nature of the domain.",
    "course_description": "Students are expected to spend approximately 140-200 hours in total on this course. Students who opt not to do a dissertation will take a SLICC + 40 electives.Planning the SLICC should commence once students begin Year 3. Ideally the chosen piece of work should link to their own contexts, experience and/or relevant employment. Students will be given an overview of what is expected well in advance. They will be provided with relevant support, materials and resources. Students define their own learning outcomes as a 'Proposal' and by looking forward into their future professional/personal aims and career aspirations and will examine the development of their attributes. Students will receive formative feedback on their 'Project Proposal' in block 1 of Year 3.  The student will present their proposal to peers.  Thereafter the student will reflect frequently using blogs to build and present evidence of their learning in an e-portfolio. They will submit and receive formative feedback in a draft report. Their work is then incorporated into a final written self-reflective report which will be the summative assessment.  The student will give a final conclusive presentation to their findings to their peers.",

Students will use these case studies to learn how to make complex decisions based on their context, and learn what is needed to manage and appraise design of digital innovation for impact in these settings.Student Learning ExperienceStudents will learn from experts who work in implementing and scaling digital solutions in Scotland and around the world. The course is delivered online and is divided into five sessions, each lasting a week. Teaching sessions will be composed of written materials and video presentations, accompanied by guided reading in the form of links to journal articles.Discussion of the content and reading materials will be posted to an online forum, along with students' answers to the problem-based learning questions. Course tutors will moderate discussion boards. Students will be graded on discussion board postings. Students will further evidence their learning by writing an assessment of an existing digital tool used within their practice from the health and social care sector by the end of the course.Formative peer and teacher-led feedback will be given throughout the course through the discussion boards, and summative assessment feedback will be provided at the end of the course.",

    "summary": "Health and social services face extensive challenges due, in part, to ageing populations and increased prevalence of chronic diseases in both developed and low and middle-income countries. The challenges mentioned above affect both countries with extensive health and social care systems and lower resource countries where local specialist care and diagnostics may not be available.The digitisation of health, social and care services and the widespread availability of digital technologies have facilitated the emergence and deployment of digitally-enabled care. Digital technologies are increasingly seen as a potential solution to many of the current challenges facing the health, social and care service sectors. This course aims to provide students with an understanding of how digital technologies can be used to improve service user wellbeing and support effective and efficient person-centred health, social and care services.",
    "course_description": "Digital technologies play an increasing role in health, social and care services, with many people relying on support from digital technologies. Digital technologies encompass a wide range of digitally-enabled health, social and care services, including remote health, care, coaching, rehabilitation, diagnostics, monitoring, fitness and smart-homes. Digital technology services involve the convergence of health systems, digital media, network technologies, mobile devices, sensors and wearables, which i) provides data for reporting and analysis for administrators, decision makers and research ii) provides health and social services professionals and service users with, sometimes, real-time access to data and information to support the delivery of care, and iii) allows service users to manage their health and care needs in more convenient ways.Course outlineThis course will provide a general introduction to concepts that underpin digital technologies applied in health, social and care services. The course will then explore how data-driven solutions shape the digital health and care technologies landscape. Next, the benefits, operation and challenges of digital technologies and how they can be used to support self-care and service user empowerment, inform decision making and reduce the burden on care services will be discussed. The course will then explore digital technologies-related to legal, ethical, privacy, data ownership and social issues. Finally, the course will examine the various barriers to digital technologies' deployment, such as concerns about usability, quality, reliability and security issues, and financial or infrastructural limitations that may prevent large scale deployment.Experts in the field will use real-life case studies from health, social and care services to highlight existing evidence of effectiveness and acceptability and explore how personal roles and responsibilities need to change, aspects of data sharing, privacy and screening, and examine the legislation, safeguarding, and regulatory requirements relating to digital technologies.",

    "course_description": "Data-driven innovation is radically transforming health, social and care service delivery and organisation. Therefore, it is vital for health, social, and care service organisations to develop individual and corporate entrepreneurial skills. Entrepreneurship and data science are inextricably linked. Data science aims to derive actionable solutions from data that improve people's health and well-being, reduce health and social inequality and manage health, social and care service systems. Entrepreneurship involves the successful development of new ventures by exploiting new data-driven solutions. This course is designed to integrate entrepreneurship and data-driven innovation so that students see them as symbiotic rather than independent activities across the health, social and care services ecosystem.This course will first introduce the theory and practice of entrepreneurship as a means of capitalising on data-driven innovation through the health, social and care service ecosystem. The course will describe innovation in the context of entrepreneurship, including innovation strategy, leadership and innovation tools such as design thinking and innovation communities. Next, the course will explore the business models that underpin entrepreneurial success, developing and leading entrepreneurial teams, entrepreneurship processes and roadmaps, and protecting innovation through intellectual property rights. The course will then focus on recognising opportunity, opportunity assessment, raising finance and business planning, globalisation, product development and sustainability. Finally, the course will focus on leading and managing entrepreneurship and data-driven innovation, including strategic teams and venturing using real-world examples from health, social and care services.",

It will include an introduction to various evaluation approaches including quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods. Students will be provided with the knowledge and skills to apply validated evaluation tools and frameworks in practice",
    "course_description": "Evidence of effectiveness of digital transformation is important to justify investments. However, evaluation of complex health and social care digital transformation is difficult as technological change is often accompanied by wider organisational transformations (which makes it hard to trace direct impact). This course will equip students with the skills to navigate the tensions between the need to measure impacts of digital transformation and to proactively identify and mitigate emerging risks.This course will enable students to gain insights into methodological considerations surrounding impacts and processes associated with digital transformation in health and care. They will be introduced to existing theoretical evaluation frameworks and guided to apply these to their ongoing practice. The course will include 10 lectures focusing on: - Digital Interventions in Health and Social Care - Digital Evaluation Frameworks and toolkits - Defining Evaluation aims, objectives and metrics - Person-centered evaluations - Regulatory Environment - National & International Case studies - COVID Case studies - Use of Evaluation Results and Impact - Monitoring & Sustaining Interventions.Students will need to identify a suitable project to evaluate within their work environment, to support them along the learning pathway. They will have an academic supervisor who will offer a dedicated support throughout the entire programme. Access to carefully curated content that includes written materials and video presentations will be gained through the Learn platform supplemented by Asynchronous and Synchronous group learning. Students will also have up to 3 (remote) sessions with their academic supervisor (formative assessment), where work towards the final submission of the summative assessment is discussed. The initial contact will focus on articulating a learning contract that stipulates expected commitment and input from the learner, mentor and supervisor. It will also clearly set the proposed Learning Objectives, Learning Resources, Learning Strategies and ways to capture Evidence of Achievement.",

    "summary": "The course introduces the core elements of digital transformation, including envisioning, strategic development, digital maturity, and service redesign. It will include critical evaluation of theories, evidence, case studies and practical tools relevant to digital transformation, leadership and change management that will provide students with the knowledge and skills required for successful digital transformation in the health, care, and housing sectors.",
    "course_description": "1) Academic description Digital transformation in health and care depends on a wide range of factors. These include strategic development, service redesign, managing organisational culture and structures, management models (policies, practices, and processes), tools and technologies, behavioural and attitudinal change in service users and other stakeholders. This course highlights the importance of effective leadership, understanding organisational contexts, workflows and routines, and user cultures and preferences when designing, planning, and implementing digital transformation. It offers practical tools and strategies for learners to enable successful adoption, scalability, and sustainability of digital transformation and to enable innovation and informed decision making for current and future health and care services.2) Outline Content This course introduces the main theories and concepts associated with digital transformation, leadership, change management and communication and relates them to the digital transformation of health and care services. The course introduces the key concepts of digital transformation, it explores the drivers, barriers, and facilitators of digital transformation, and offers and overview of digital implementation challenges affecting health and social care delivery. Thus, by highlighting how digital transformation can benefit both professionals and citizens to enable the delivery of high quality, person-centred, efficient, sustainable health, and care services. The course further explores effective leadership approaches and capabilities of both leaders and their teams, using reflection and collaborative approaches including, co-production and networking opportunities. It explores theoretical foundations regarding change management and communication, exploring organisational readiness for change and digital transformation in the work environment and signposts to evidence-based methods and tools to support effective change management approaches. Throughout the course we will be drawing on examples from the evidence and health and care services.3) Student Learning Experience Students will learn from experts who work in or teach about leading and managing digital transformation. The course will clearly set the proposed learning objectives, learning resources, learning strategies and ways to capture evidence of achievement. Students will be expected to identify a suitable and willing mentor, within their work environment, to support them along the learning pathway. This will involve articulating a learning contract that stipulates expected commitment and input from the learner and their mentor. The course content is delivered online and is divided into four two week and one week sessions/topic areas including a reading week. Teaching sessions will be composed of written materials and video presentations, accompanied by guided reading in the form of links to journal articles and other web-based resources. These include national and international reports, policies and strategies, with the knowledge gained being used in conjunction with reflective exercises and problem-based learning questions. Discussion of the content and reading materials will be posted to an online forum, along with students' answers to the problem-based learning questions. Course tutors will moderate discussion boards. Summative assessment feedback will be provided at the end of the course. Students will be graded on a recorded presentation related to a digital transformation and a group project related to a choice of topic from either leadership or change management. They will also be expected to maintain a reflective account of their learning for the group project.",

Preventative care is focused on disease prevention and is conducted mainly in community-based programs. Primary care is usually the first contact with the health, social and care services system and typically addresses acute, chronic, and preventive disease issues. Secondary care is generally focused on a particular organ system or disease processes, such as diabetes, cardiology, or oncology. Tertiary care can be thought of as consultative subspecialty care is typically provided at large medical centres. Social and care services involve all forms of personal and practical help for children, young people and adults who need extra support. Social and care services include social work services for children and families, care at home, care homes, children's daycare, drop-in centres and advice and information services. The service user and providers are at the centre of this complex network of community workers, clinicians, health and care workers, and digital technologies.Outline ContentThis course will introduce students to health, social and care service delivery and organisation. The course will focus on health, social and care service stakeholders, policy, regulation, and challenges across health, social, and care services in later weeks. As these topics are delivered, students will be encouraged to critically reflect upon opportunities for and barriers against data-driven innovation within and across health, social and care service organisations.",

    "summary": "For optimal health and care delivery, we need to embed quality improvement as a key element. Implementation science is the study of theories and methods to promote the systematic integration of real-world evidence into health and social care policy and practice. Implementation studies assess the impact of data-driven innovation and address the barriers that slow its uptake of evidence-based interventions, tools, policies, and guidelines that improve the quality and efficiency of health, social and care services and improve outcomes for service users. The course aims to equip students with the skills to appraise and integrate data-driven innovation implementation theories, models, frameworks and strategies to develop systematic theory-informed approaches for achieving evidence-based data-driven innovation and technical change in the health, social and care context.This course is ideal for students from health and social or computational backgrounds and researchers looking to develop expertise in implementation science and improve the quality and effectiveness of health services.No prior knowledge of health, social and care services nor implementation science is required.",
    "course_description": "The translation of evidence-based interventions, tools, policies, and guidelines into practice is slow. Implementation science is the study of the methods to promote the uptake of evidence-based change into routine practice to improve the innovativeness, quality and effectiveness of care services. The gaps between knowledge and practice are well documented, and a wide range of implementation science theories, models, frameworks, and strategies are available to reduce knowledge to practice gaps. In order to optimise their impact, implementation methods must be tailored to the target population, setting and desired health and welfare, service, organisational or policy outcomes.The course will first introduce implementation science, barriers to successful implementation and how implementation science can be used to improve the innovativeness, quality and effectiveness of health, social and care services. The course then will then focus on the four implementation stages: 1) needs assessment for implementation: developing a clear strategy and vision and stakeholder engagement; 2) preparation: getting ready for change; 3) implementation: building knowledge, understanding and confidence; and finally 4) evaluation of outcomes: monitor and review progress. In this course, students will have the opportunity to work in groups and independently on their course assessment to critically reflect on and appraise and integrate implementation theories, models and frameworks to develop a strategy for achieving evidence-based/evidence-informed change within the health and social care context.",

This course introduces the principles underlying the design, implementation and use of databases and information systems in the health, social and care services context.2) Course outlineDatabases and information systems provide technology and support that enable information exchange for health, social and care services professionals, enterprises, and the care sector. The course will introduce databases and information systems used in the health, social and care services sector. The course will also explore the integration and linkage of data across information systems across the health, social, and care services and the future landscape of health, social, and care service databases and information system.The practical aspects of the course will focus on relational databases, relational database management systems, and the SQL (Structured Query Language) used in programming and managing data held in database management systems, information systems, and socio-technical issues associated with the use and implementation of databases and information systems. Students will get hands-on experience writing SQL commands to filter, sort, manipulate, manage and summarise real-world health, social and care services data held in a relational database management system.3) Student Learning ExperienceStudents will learn from database and information systems experts. The course is delivered online and is divided into five sessions, each lasting a week. Teaching sessions will be composed of written materials, video presentations, coding exercises, and problem-based learning questions.Discussion of the content and reading materials will be posted to an online forum, along with students' answers to the problem-based learning questions. Course tutors will moderate discussion boards. Students will further evidence their learning by writing SQL queries to a given specification by the end of the course.Formative peer and teacher-led feedback will be given throughout the course through the discussion boards, and summative assessment feedback will be provided at the end of the course.",

    "course_description": "This course introduces students to the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically applied to the health and social care context. NLP focuses on text data, which often lacks the structured format of conventional tabular data. It is estimated that 80% of health and social care is unstructured. In health and social care, unstructured data includes clinical notes, patient narratives, medical literature, social media posts, and even handwritten documents.In health and social care, textual information is abundant in various sources, including electronic health records, medical literature, social media posts and online discussions and resources. Text data is a fundamental source of information in the 21st century. Natural Language Processing (NLP), the branch of AI that deals with this type of data, is in massively high demand both in academia and industry. NLP is one of the most important and useful application areas of artificial intelligence. The field of NLP is evolving rapidly as new methods and toolsets converge with an ever-expanding availability of data.In this five-week online course, topics will be covered to equip learners with foundational knowledge and practical skills using NLP methods.Week 1: Introduction to NLP in health and social care contextWeek 2: Text Preprocessing and TokenisationWeek 3: Information Extraction and Named Entity Recognition (NER)Week 4: Applications and Case StudiesWeek 5: Other Advanced NLP Techniques",

    "course_description": "1.Academic descriptionDigital transformation in health and care is complex and requires theoretical grounding as well as a multi-stakeholder approach. There are no recipes for success in digital transformation initiatives, but there are existing tools and strategies that can help change leaders navigate this complex landscape. These focus on the properties of technological and social infrastructures. This course will help students to understand the emergent properties of health information infrastructures, relevant existing theories, stakeholder perspectives and equip them with evidence-based tools to manage initiatives.2) Outline ContentThis course will enable students to gain insights into the various social and technological aspects involved in leading digital transformation projects. The course will focus on multi-stakeholder perspectives that need to be aligned and managed during digital transformation within organisational environments but also wider macro environmental aspects impacting digitalisation. It will include approaches to procurement, vendor management, stakeholder engagement, policy environments, interoperability and standards, secondary uses of data, information governance, integrated care, and approaches to innovation.3) Student Learning ExperienceStudents will need to demonstrate their grasp of the complexity involved in operating, designing and implementing digital strategies within the digital transformation landscape, in the context of their domain. They will engage in innovative pedagogy that harness the power of prospective hindsight - imagining that an event has already occurred - to prospectively mitigate emerging risks.",

This course aims to equip students with the tools and frameworks to analyse health and social care systems, enabling them to deliver effective solutions for integrated care.The course is ideal for students from health, social and care services or computational backgrounds who would like to learn about the fundamentals of systems thinking and systems engineering applied in the health and social care context.Students taking this course do not require any prior knowledge of systems thinking or systems engineering. However, evidence of prior learning of data science and health, social and care service systems is required.",
    "course_description": "The situations and events that health and social care professionals deal with in their daily practice are complex. Therefore, understanding and approaching problems from a systems perspective in organisations are essential for care professionals. Systems thinking is a powerful approach for focusing on how systems operate and how system components interact and work together within the system as a whole. Systems thinking tools are used to analyse and understand complex and uncertain real-world problems. These tools are used alongside systems engineering approaches to take this understanding and successfully deliver new and improved products and services.This course is designed to teach students how to apply systems thinking tools and systems engineering approaches to analyse and develop solutions for complex problems in health and social care systems.This course will first introduce systems thinking and data-driven systems thinking, the tools used to solve complex problems and provide solutions to challenges in health and social care systems. The course will then introduce system modelling and how system modelling can be used to better understand system dynamics, identify and formulate solutions to complex problems and support decision-making in health and social care systems. Next, the course will explore and apply the systems engineering approaches that are used to support systems decomposition, requirement management, verification and validation and stakeholder analysis associated with the development of complex systems. Finally, the course will focus on selecting and implementing change, including multi-stakeholder involvement, implementing change, and evaluating systems development projects using real-world examples from health, social, and care services.",

    "course_description": "The work-based placement allows the student to put theory into practice within a Â¿real-worldÂ¿ setting in an industry setting or public sector organisation. Students will develop their skills and knowledge, both specialist and transferrable, enhancing their employability. The work-based project will provide students with the opportunity to build their networks by connecting and working with professionals in industry or public sector. Crucially, it will develop commercial, professional or situational awareness, developing knowledge of the current local and global business landscapes, industries, organisations and specific roles. Working under the guidance of an academic supervisor (based at UoE) and work mentor (based at placement setting) students will be offered the opportunity to work on an industry/public sector-based project to solve practical problems that require an application-oriented thinking.Students will gain transferable skills through applied, practical experience with host organisations.  Host organisations may be based in Scotland, rest of the UK or internationally and include industry, public sector, charities, third sector, think tanks, charities, NGOs and community-based groups. All work-based projects will be offered as virtual placements with no requirement to visit the UK.A list of pre-arranged work-based projects will be presented to students in Year 2. Alternatively, students may choose to arrange their own placement. Input from the Programme Director will be necessary to confirm that the scope of the proposed project is suitable for a work-based dissertation.The work based project takes nine months part-time to complete. The work base placement course supports students with a dedicated virtual learning environment, including online tools such as informal and formal asynchronous discussion boards and an e-portfolio. Supplementary (optional) online tutorials and expert guest lectures will also feature utilising synchronous web applications whenever possible. Students will be allocated a UoE supervisor with relevant expertise and a work based mentor. Supervisors will hold a minimum of 10 timetabled meetings with the student and will be available for consultation throughout the placement. A record of supervisory meetings will also be logged.  Supervisor support can take on many forms and may be provided face-to-face, or remotely, via e-mail, or telephone, zoom/teams. Supervisory support will be supplemented by the detailed work based placement handbook. Regular community learning sessions will provide students with the opportunity to reflect on the experience of their peers and identify opportunities for learning while building a strong sense of academic community within and outwith the programme.",

Offered in the final year of the part-time MSc programme, students are given an opportunity to craft and present an evidence based professional account of their learning progression.This course, which is an alternative to submission of a research-focused dissertation, builds on the foundations of critical inquiry. The dissertation by ePortfolio is set to support students to adopt a more systematic, disciplined and rigorous way of thinking about both their practice and their learning. Learners will also develop a stronger, more confidant sense of academic identity or self-authorship, using communication tools such as blogs/vlogs and other (social) media channels.Using a collection of authentic artefacts, the student should present diverse evidence to demonstrate attainment of intended learning outcomes. Artefacts can be audio and/or video files as well as written or pictorial digital assets.  The rationale for and the integration of artefacts, as part of a cohesive collection, must be linked to core themes in the MSc programme as a whole.A framework for the final submission should demonstrate learner's achievements in capturing evidence that they have gained competencies across the 7 facets of mastersness:Level of complexity, Degree of abstraction, Depth of learning, Research and enquiry, Degree of autonomy and responsibility, Complexity and unpredictability and Professionalism (Bamber 2013).",

The role of the supervisor, in supporting the learner, is critical and ongoing interaction is essential for the success of the course. We will have a dedicated resource and a robust plan to ensure supervisors are prepared for their role, in advance of the start of the course.At the heart of a dissertation project is the  application of meta cognitive skills, learnt whilst on the MSc programme, and the acquisition of new Skills. This dissertation course aims to give students options and an opportunity to further develop their practice. Learners need to apply their learning by crafting a substantial and sustained independent piece of work to showcase 'Masterness'.Outline ContentThe dissertation will assess the students' ability to design and complete a significant project, investigation or development. It encourages students to creatively tackle a challenge and to reflect and critically review their progress. Learners will be expected to consolidate as well as extend their knowledge, skills and practice as well as communicate outcomes and impact in an accessible and relatable way.Student Learning ExperienceThe e-portfolio takes nine months (part-time) to complete, and is largely self-directed.

    "course_description": "\"One size does not fit all\" and this is particularly true of clinical trials in special populations.Researchers face a difficult balance between 'gatekeeping' for people who are not able to consent or protect their own interests, and a necessity to include a generalisable sample and answer important questions relevant to specific populations. If researchers did not include special populations, a clear gap in knowledge would result.We will begin the course by looking at what makes a group of individuals a 'special', 'vulnerable' or 'underrepresented' population in clinical research; exploring both intrinsic and situational factors. Each unit will then focus on a number of special populations and topical issues, exposing the course participants to trials of populations with different demographics, clinical conditions and research settings.Research with special populations is challenging. We absolutely need better clinical trials with these populations. Course participants will have the opportunity to see how research with special populations has implications for trial design, consent, risk assessments and safety reporting; and how consideration needs to be given to recruitment, retention and adherence.This course will include a range of 'real-life' research challenges and present opportunities for the development of potential strategies and solutions as presented in the following 5 units:- Unit 1 - Introduction to Special Populations and Age- Unit 2 - Capacity, Mental Health and Learning Disabilities- Unit 3 - Prisons and Emergency Critical Care- Unit 4 - Sex, Pregnancy and Ethnicity- *Unit 5a - Clinical Trials and Rare Diseases- *Unit 5b - Outsourcing Clinical Trials*These units of study are created by the participants in a 'flipped classroom' approach to learning.",

The project involves both the application of skills learnt in the past and the acquisition of new skills.

We encourage co-supervision from the public sector (e.g. NHS) and industry, from which we anticipate a fruitful supply of appropriately challenging project topics.In this dissertation course you will be working independently on an extended piece of writing which is original and presents new research within it in the form of a sustained argument. The dissertation marks the final stage of your Masters degree and demonstrates that over the course of the programme you have gained the skills and knowledge required to engage in the formal and rigorous process of research. This process entails, but is not restricted to, identifying a suitable research topic, formulating research objectives, organising/analysing data, organising and reviewing relevant literature, devising an appropriate research methodology, reporting results, drawing conclusions and possibly even making relevant recommendations to the wider research community.The design and conduct of the project will require a high level of commitment and application from the student. The dissertation demonstrates their ability to think scientifically and complete a research report that follows expected academic conventions of style, tone, structuring and referencing. Supervisory support will be supplemented by the detailed project handbook given to all students.The types of activity involved in each project will vary but will include most of the following:- researching the literature and gathering background information- analysing requirements, comparing alternatives and specifying a solution- analysing and extending relevant theory in novel ways- designing and implementing the solution- experimenting with and evaluating the solution- discussing existing results and presenting new research- developing written and oral presentation skillsCommunication with supervisors, including discussion progress and review of draft materials, will be determined by the student and supervisor and is most likely to be carried out by a combination of email and telephony, although all parties are encouraged to use a wiki which will be set up for each studentÂ¿s project.

This course will explore the fundamental ethical principles that underpin clinical research guidelines and shape the regulatory landscape globally.Students will be introduced to key ethical and regulatory frameworks in place today, consider the drivers for their development and evaluate their impact on RCTs. There will be a focus on Good Clinical Practice (GCP), an international safety and quality standard, which will allow students to develop an understanding of the main objectives of GCP and how it can be applied in an effective and risk proportionate manner.Research governance structures will be considered, including external review by regulatory authorities and ethics committees, as well as the internal mechanisms sponsors use to maintain oversight of clinical trials.Students will examine the ethical basis of informed consent, with critical exploration of how consent can be obtained in a variety of settings and patient populations. They will further explore how trial participants are safeguarded through the application of safety reporting procedures, and the importance of data integrity in supporting good decision making for future patient care.Throughout the course students will be challenged to address difficult ethical issues in RCTs, apply their knowledge and critical thinking to draw their own conclusions on the application of ethical and regulatory frameworks, and discuss and debate their position with their peers through online participation.",

The SLICC framework requires that students use the generic learning outcomes to articulate their learning in their own defined project, reflect frequently using a blog, collect, formulate, organise and present evidence of their learning in an e-portfolio. Students will receive relevant formative feedback on a draft final report, which is the same format as the final reflective report, which forms the summative assessment. The above will be with guidance of a mentor. The course will encourage critical appraisal of students' own practical experiences, and allow them to reflect on their learning in the context of the cross-disciplinary nature of clinical trials.",

Students who opt not to do a dissertation will take a SLICC + 40 credits of electives.Planning the SLICC should commence once students begin Year 3. Ideally the chosen piece of work should link to their own contexts, experience with clinical trials and/or relevant employment. Students will be given an overview of what is expected well in advance. They will be provided with relevant support, materials and resources. Students define their own learning outcomes as a 'Proposal' and by looking forward into their future professional/personal aims and career aspirations and will examine the development of their attributes. Students will receive formative feedback on their 'Project Proposal' in block 1 of Year 3.   The student will present their proposal to peers.Thereafter the student will reflect frequently using blogs to build and present evidence of their learning in an e-portfolio. They will submit and receive formative feedback in a draft report. Their work is then incorporated into a final written self-reflective report which will be the summative assessment.  The student will give a final conclusive presentation of their findings to their peers.",

This includes some core topics of Economics as well as the special tools of Health Economics/Economic Evaluation. The special features of health and health care within an economics market paradigm will be analysed. Students will develop an in depth understanding of the market failures arising from these features and acquire knowledge of several important examples. Based on that, students will learn about the demand and supply of health care as well as the influence one can have on the demand for healthcare in terms of lifestyle decisions. Concepts of equity and equality are studied and the concept of incentives is analysed firstly with respect to the overall health care market and subsequently the special features within clinical trials are critically reflected upon.The relevance of Health Economics for evidence-based medicine  and evidence based decision making will be studied together with the principles of economic evaluation. The tools of health economics as applied in economic evaluations will be analysed and applied in detail. Students will develop a strong understanding of how health outcomes can be valued, costs can be measured, and how alternative interventions may be compared and learn how to apply different tools of economic evaluation.  A key learning objective is that students will be capable of evaluating economic evaluations in the field of Clinical Trials. Finally, to place Health Economics into context knowledge students will critically appraise economic evaluations of clinical trials.",

Quality should be in built and on a continuum, which begins during the planning and design phase, is critical during the conducting and recording period, and persists throughout reporting and publication of the trial results.Two quality assessment activities well known to the clinical research team are monitoring and audit. While both are normally discussed collectively in relation to clinical trial oversight, they have individual functions with inter-dependencies set within compliance regulation.This course will introduce quality assurance systems and quality control activities used for audit and monitoring purposes to ensure the quality of all aspects of the clinical trials, as well as presenting opportunities to develop hands on risk assessment and monitoring skills.Additionally, participants will examine, identify and problem-solve specific challenges presented by the increasing complexity of clinical research involving for example, globalisation, third party vendors, electronic data and trial management systems.This elective offers practical opportunities to develop processes, skills and critical appraisal abilities to employ quality within participants' current and future roles as investigator, trial manager or researcher as presented in the following 5 units:Unit 1 -  Introduction to Monitoring and AuditUnit 2 -  Safety Reporting, Protocol Violations and BreachesUnit 3 -  Monitoring 101Unit 4 -  Data ManagementUnit 5 -  Trial Close and When an Inspector Calls",

They will further explore how trial participants are safeguarded through the application of safety reporting procedures, and the importance of data integrity in supporting good decision making for future patient care.Throughout the course students will be challenged to address difficult ethical issues in RCTs, apply their knowledge and critical thinking to draw their own conclusions on the application of ethical and regulatory frameworks, and discuss and debate their position with their peers through online participation.",

    "summary": "This online course describes a selection of statistical methods to deal with more advanced problems in epidemiology, building on the principles and approaches described in the course Advanced Epidemiology (PUHR11112). It covers methods to deal with missing data, allow for longitudinal data and other problems that involve correlated measurements, and assess the accuracy of predictive models..",
    "course_description": "This online course is designed to allow students who have developed some expertise in statistical modelling to expand the range of methods with which they feel competent, and to learn a general approach to dealing with inferentially-complex situations. It develops ideas discussed in Advanced Epidemiology (PUHR11112), and examines the statistical aspects and implementation of these in the R statistical programming environment. Three main areas will be covered:1.\tDetecting missing data using a mixture of simpler exploratory/ graphical methods, and adjusting models for this issue using multiple imputation.2.\tAn introduction to the use of mixed effects models, particularly for longitudinal data.3.\tAssessing the accuracy of prediction models using diagnostic test measures, C-index and related methods. It will also introduce the bootstrap for this purpose, as well as discussing its use for solving inferential problems that otherwise have poor or unknown distributional behaviour.The course will draw out both the unique features and similarities to other types of statistical inference, as well as discussing model diagnostics checking, variable selection and model building.The course will consist of a mix of recorded lectures, readings, and practical exercises conducted in the open source R statistical programming language.  For each practical, students will be encouraged to discuss their analysis plans, share useful code \"shortcuts\" and discuss their results on the discussion boards. The data sets for these exercises will be based on real epidemiological data sets and/ or common problems, although the principles will be applicable more broadly across a wide range of medical and scientific research.",

Students will apply learning from the Research Design for Epidemiology course to identify a research topic, develop and refine a research question, translate their question into feasible aims and objectives, and design an appropriate epidemiological study. Successful completion of the project requires students to apply their epidemiological and statistical learning from earlier in the programme to successfully design the project, conduct analyses, present the findings and critically discuss their work at the appropriate level of academic writing. Students will acquire further applied research skills throughout the year.Students are encouraged to identify a project area and research question that interests them and that is feasible and achievable within the boundaries of the dissertation year. Research projects should take the form of a data analysis project, an infectious disease modelling project or a systematic review with a meta-analysis component. Students will be supported by the programme team to identify and access suitable existing data on which to perform secondary data analysis. Supervisors will be matched to students based on mutual topic/methods interests.The dissertation will assess the students ability to independently conduct a quantitative epidemiological research project, critically reflect on and evaluate their work and communicate effectively in a structured piece of academic writing.",

The SLICC framework requires that students use the generic learning outcomes to articulate their learning in their own defined project, reflect frequently using a blog, and collect and curate evidence of their learning in an e-portfolio.  They will submit and receive feedback on a SLICC proposal and a summative midway report.  Their work is then incorporated into a final written summative self-reflective report.

Ideally the chosen piece of work should link to their own contexts and/or employment.  Students will be given an overview of what is expected well in advance.  They will be provided with relevant support, materials and resources.  Students define their own learning outcomes as a 'Proposal' and by looking forward into their future professional/personal aims and career aspirations will examine the development of their attributes.  Students will receive formative feedback on their 'Project Proposal' by the start of Year 3.   The student will present their proposal to peers.The SLICC framework requires that students reflect frequently using a blog, and collect and curate evidence of their learning in an e-portfolio.

The special features of health and health care within the standard economics market paradigm will be explored in depth. Students will develop an understanding of the market failures arising from these features and acquire knowledge of several important examples.  The relevance of Health Economics for evidence-based medicine and evidence-based public health will be explained in topics covering current UK NHS resource allocation policies. The tools of Health Economics as applied in economic evaluations will be examined in detail. Students will develop a strong understanding of how health outcomes can be valued, costs can be measured, and how alternative interventions may be compared. A key learning objective is that students will be capable of personally critically appraising economic evaluations in the field of Public Health. Health Economics concepts will be put into context by exploring the past and current resource allocations in the health sector. This will be covered from both a UK and an international perspective.",

It can help us to understand how people experience different aspects of that social world and how they respond to it i.e. what they feel, think and do.Understanding experiences and behaviour in a way that is embedded in social reality is essential to public health practice. People are the subject of public health and qualitative research aims to better understand people as individuals who are situated in and influenced by their social context.In this course we will learn about the different perspective on health and people that is provided by the ideas and approaches of qualitative research. We will explore the philosophical and sociological ideas that underpin the variety of ways in which qualitative research is practiced.We will learn about the qualitative research process, including practicing data generation using individual interviews, focus groups and observational methods. In this part of the course you will develop your own qualitative research questions, with support from a tutor, and use what you have learned to develop your own study design to present in your assessment.We will then move on to explore the initial stages of qualitative data analysis.At the core of all these activities will be a focus on how rigour is conceptualised and practiced in qualitative research to generate useful knowledge about the social world. Central to this is considering and accounting for the role of the researcher in qualitative research.As we learn about all the different aspects of qualitative research we will keep in mind the ideas and activities involved in quantitative research approaches and consider how and why they are different. In learning about how to do rigorous qualitative research we will reflect on the quality of published qualitative research that might be used in public health practice which you will do as part of your assessment.",

    "course_description": "This course is designed to equip students who have already undertaken some learning in the principles of statistical methodology with a grounding in the practical skills of data analysis using the open source R statistical programming language. The course will introduce good practice in data management and key skills in exploratory and inferential statistical analysis. Extensive use will be made of tidyverse packages such as readr, tidyr, diplyr and ggplot2. Statistical topics to be covered include numerical and graphical descriptive methods, simple one and two sample comparisons of categorical and continuous data using both confidence intervals and hypothesis tests, contingency tables and risk ratios, direct and indirect standardisation, measures for diagnostic testing, correlation and simple linear regression. The course (delivered online) will be based around 5 weekly case studies/ projects that will require students to undertake software-based analyses after using a mix of short recorded lectures and readings designed to illustrate each set of principles, with each week's activity building on the last. Each week, students will be encouraged to discuss their analysis plans, share useful code 'shortcuts' and discuss their resultson the discussion boards. The case studies will be based on real data sets and/ or common problems in epidemiology.",

Underlying approaches will be examined and then different methods will be looked at in more detail. Practical components will be incorporated into the course, such as carrying out in-depth interviews and participating in class exercises and discussions.

People are the subject of public health and qualitative research aims to better understand people as individuals who are situated in, and influenced by, their social context.Our aim during this introductory course is for you to understand the core ideas, processes and activities underpinning the qualitative approach to researching the social world and for you to be able to identify aspects of rigour and quality in studies carried out by other researchers. This knowledge will allow you to critically appraise and use qualitative research in relation to public health practice and provides a grounding for further study of qualitative methods during the MPH programme.",

There will be significant practical aspects to the course, the aim being that the students finish feeling confident enough to plan and conduct: (1) a research interview in a rigorous way and (2) an analysis of qualitative data, generated either through their own fieldwork or  by doing a secondary analysis of existing data generated by other researchers.  Students will also apply the concepts and criteria of rigour to interviewing and data analysis.  The course is framed to be of relevance to anyone who is interested in learning more about qualitative research, and will help to prepare for a qualitative dissertation project on the MPH (online) programme.",
    "course_description": "This is a 5-week distance learning course worth 10 credits.  Students are expected to spend 15-20 hours per week on this course.  Students are given a brief overview of the course and will then be provided with relevant materials and resources.  Specific tasks and online discussion exercises relating to each week's topic will be set.  This will culminate in a written assignment at the end of the course.  More specifically the course covers:-applying the core concepts and ideas from the course 'Introduction to Qualitative Research Methods' (such as rigour, keeping an audit trail, interpretive approach, reflexivity, open and closed coding) to interviewing and data analysis- developing an interview guide- conducting an interview-conducting a small secondary analysis of a small quantitative dataset",

    "summary": "This course provides a comprehensive and multi-faceted understanding of societal issues in 'reproductive health' - family formation, sexuality, and sexual health/well being. A multi-disciplinary approach is needed because reproductive and well-being/health outcomes intersect in numerous ways with: relationships (intimate, family and community), socio-economic position/setting; society (legislative and cultural context); contraceptive technology; and health service provision.[Pregnancy and birth will not be covered since there is a pre-existing 10-credit course in Maternal Health (GLHE11014)]",
    "course_description": "Reproduction is the natural process by which humans are brought into the world, but it is shaped by social factors, as are sex, conception and childbirth. 'Reproductive wellbeing' is broader than reproduction, encompassing also: strategies to prevent unwanted pregnancy/birth; feelings arising in the course of sexual behaviours (even where there is certainty, or hope, that reproduction will not follow); sexual orientation/identity; and infections that are transmitted sexually. Thus health policy and health service provision can impact on reproductive well-being.Reproductive/sexual behaviour encompasses many types of human interactions ranging from:  enduring intimate relationships to fleeting encounters, mutually negotiated to abusive and coercive, enhancing social and individual well-being to causing distress and often long-term harm.The course will apply theories and methods used in understanding and interpreting global health, focussing on the determinants that shape reproductive health/wellbeing, and issues of inequality and inequity.  Topics include the intersection of reproduction and reproductive rights with gender and gender identity and other social divisions; the expression of reproductive right in national legislation and health policy.",

The sociology of health and illness is a sub-discipline within sociology, with a range of theoretical perspectives and concepts; it is also a strongly empirical discipline.Sociology is one of the core disciplines within Public Health. This module introduces students to the field and aims to support the student towards in-depth understanding of topics of particular interest to them.Other than in the first session which will be an overall introduction to the module, students will be expected to prepare for each week through their own reading from the supplied reading lists in preparation for seminar based discussions. Specified reading is indicative rather than definitive and students may wish to seek out their own reading.",

Concepts of One HealthÂ¿ will be introduced, reinforced and potentially further developed.  Group work will form a major part of this course.  Barriers to working with people from different disciplines, and innovative approaches to facilitating such work and to developing and building new communities to address health challenges, will be explored. By the end of the course, students will have developed a deeper awareness of the complexities of working across disciplines, and some related strategies to use in their own professional and practice environments.",
    "course_description": "The Innovative Approaches course has been designed to support participants from a broad range of natural and social science backgrounds to explore a variety of approaches to complex health challenges. Such challenges will increasingly confront health professionals with complexity and uncertainty, particularly when working at the intersections of human, other-than-human animal and environmental health.To work effectively on such complex challenges requires us to work collaboratively with others: other professionals, other disciplines and other stakeholders. There is thus an emphasis throughout this course on working in small groups, not just across disciplines, but also across difference and many other divisions and boundaries. This requires us to develop our listening skills in particular, as proficiency in listening is the bedrock upon which innovative, co-creative responses are founded.This course will be innovative, exploring the sources of creativity whilst emphasising experiential learning and reflexivity. As such, it will challenge you to deepen your awareness of yourself, of others, and of the complex health challenges you will be working on. It may therefore be challenging at times. However, by exploring all of this together, over the course, it is hoped that you will feel (and be) able to learn from each other and will find yourselves developing new creative approaches, rooted in receptivity and responsiveness. This is likely to support you in learning how to work more proficiently with your professional colleagues and other participating stakeholders.",

    "summary": "This introductory global health course will equip students with an understanding of how the health of the world's population has changed over time, how and why it might change in future and what might be done to influence these trajectories.  A recurring theme throughout the course is that essentially the same global drivers are responsible for the health risks faced by populations in both high and middle/low income countries.  The stark differences in health outcomes in high income compared with middle/low income countries is not primarily a reflection of different risks but of differences in the capacity to prevent or respond to these risks.  The field of global health is a constantly and rapidly changing one, so the focus of this course is not simply to teach students about current global health priorities but rather to equip them with the skills and knowledge to assess and critically appraise global health evidence so that they can become effective decision-makers and problem-solvers.",
    "course_description": "This course is organised into five weekly sessions.  Sessions 1 to 4 cover the topics listed below.  The final session is for student group presentations and feedback.  The four preceding sessions are:1.\tWhat is global health? This session examines the concept of global health and how this has evolved over the last 70 years or so.  We consider evolving global health governance arrangements.2.\tMeasuring global health: We look at how different types of global health issue can be measured and at the inherent challenges involved.  We introduce and briefly critique the global burden of disease approach and look at what this tells us about evolving global health issues.  We also consider the concept of globalisation and global drivers of health and disease.3.\tHealth inequity: We introduce the concept of health inequity and the seminal work of Sir Michael Marmot.  We look at tools for assessing the equity impact of public health interventions and different health system arrangements.4.\tGender and health: We focus on gender as one form of inequity and introduce a tool for analysing the impact of gender on disease and disease outcomes.The final week of the course is devoted to student presentations, which constitutes 40% of the summative assessment for this course.  Students are divided into three groups and present the results of their enquiries into:1. Communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional diseases2. Noncommunicable diseases3. Injuries and violenceThese enquiries cover an analysis of the magnitude/global burden of the issue, the underlying causes/drivers, the identification of risk factors and at-risk populations/groups and a critical analysis of global initiatives and evidence-based interventions to address the issue.  Students receive peer and tutor feedback.",

    "summary": "Qualitative research is concerned with developing explanations of social phenomena, it aims to help us to understand the world in which we live and why things are the way they are. It is concerned with the social aspects of our world and seeks to answer questions about:- Why people behave the way they do- How opinions and attitudes are formed- How people are affected by the events that go on around them- How and why cultures have developed in the way they have- The differences between social groups.This course provides an introduction to qualitative research methods.  Underlying approaches will be examined and then different methods will be looked at in more detail. Practical components will be incorporated into the course, such as carrying out in-depth interviews and participating in class exercises and discussions. Students will be expected to do background reading on the topics. Students will also learn how to analyse qualitative data, what some of the challenges of mixing methods are and how to appraise published qualitative research.",
    "course_description": "Qualitative research is concerned with developing explanations of the social world. It can help us to understand how people experience different aspects of that social world and how they respond to it i.e. what they feel, think and do.Understanding experiences and behaviour in a way that is embedded in social reality is essential to public health practice. People are the subject of public health and qualitative research aims to better understand people as individuals who are situated in, and influenced by, their social context.Our aim during this introductory course is for you to understand the core ideas, processes and activities underpinning the qualitative approach to researching the social world and for you to be able to identify aspects of rigour and quality in studies carried out by other researchers. This knowledge will allow you to critically appraise and use qualitative research in relation to public health practice and provides a grounding for further study of qualitative methods during the MPH programme.",
