<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">The course invites students to play with Artificial Intelligence (AI) in order to create and tell stories, using image and text. The AI technology is seen as a tool that can both generate new ideas and complement those of a person, while also acting as a potential bridge for collaboration between people. <br />
<br />
Starting from no technical background, the student will learn how AI, and especially Machine Learning, functions along with its strengths and limitations. With a combination of hands-on experience, workshops on creative storytelling, and invited lectures from experts in the diverse areas on AI and its application for creating stories, we will prepare students for a creative career with AI, participating in AI projects, or starting on a more technical path.</td>

<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    In the pre-intensive peropd, the opening lecture will introduce you to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the various options it provides for Storytelling. This is followed by a creativity workshop, which aims to ease you into the overall theme of the course. The idea is that you will take the skills and ideas developed there with you into the two days of intensive day workshops and the course projects. These projects primarily involve writing a story with the use of AI (no previous programming experience required). <br />
<br />
Most self study time, as well as the intensive day workshops, will have you working with a high level AI tool-set that has been custom made for the course (and which you can 'take home' when the course is over). <br />
<br />
In the intensive days, we will focus a bit more on some technical aspects of AI, helping you better understand how the tools you have been using work. At the same time, you will be invited to build AI solutions 'by hand', replicating the process Machine Learning algorithms go through. These days will culminate in collaborative activities using the tools you have been practising with in weeks prior, and testing the limits of their creative potential, while also exposing you to the dangers of their uncritical use.<br />
<br />
Evaluation will be undertaken via two pieces of coursework, at 20% and 80%, both of which follow a similar structure, with 85% of the mark attached to story generation exercises. Using the provided AI tool-set, you will be tasked with directing the AI into producing a story that accomplishes certain feats. The rest 15% of each coursework involves technical tasks related to AI engineering, such as working with code repositories or introductory level programming, and critique of provided examples.<br />
<br />
Following the intensive days, you will continue to self-study and work on the projects. A short series of invited lectures will run during this period, providing you with guidance on further possibilities for storytelling with AI, each focussing on a different AI area or application.<br />
<br />
Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:<br />
<br />
The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities.<br />
<br />
Students should be aware that:<br />
- Classrooms used in this course will have additional technology in place: students might not be able to sit in areas away from microphones or outside the field of view of all cameras.<br />
- Unless the lecturer or tutor indicates otherwise you should assume the session is being recorded.<br />
<br />
As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.

<td colspan="14">Summative Assessment:<br />
<br />
The course will be assessed by means of the following assessment components:<br />
<br />
1) Creative Story Writing Project with AI / Execution of Technical Tasks (20%)<br />
<br />
- 85% of the overall assessment component mark will be derived from the Creative Story Writing Project with AI.  This will be built around creating a story with 3 acts.  This assessment component focuses on having the student use all techniques demonstrated in the course, with most questions explicitly identifying which techniques to use.<br />
- 15% of the overall assessment component mark will be derived from execution of technical tasks. For this assessment component, these will have very specific steps, with significant instructor support.<br />
<br />
2) Creative Story Writing Project with AI / Execution of Technical Tasks (80%)<br />
<br />
- 85% of the overall assessment component mark will be derived from the Creative Story Writing Project with AI.  This will be built around creating a story with 5 acts.  This assessment component allows for more flexibility in what techniques to use for each question, while also involving the need to creatively use combinations of techniques.<br />
- 15% of the overall assessment component mark will be derived from the execution of technical tasks. For this assessment component, these will mostly have very specific steps, with significant instructor support, but also provide some more open ended challenges.<br />
<br />
Both pieces of coursework are primarily evaluated on the successful achievement of specified types of output from the AI (e.g. 'make the AI make an absurd statement' or 'investigate the AI's bias in relation to the attributes of certain items or people'). There will be a limit to the maximum size of each project, determined by maximum number of AI-calls, and a limit on the number of human-authored words. This accounts for 85% of each coursework, and primarily tests learning outcomes 1 and 2.<br />
<br />
15% of each coursework will consist of exercises primarily testing learning outcomes 3 and 4. These will provide some alternative tasks for the student to pick, each of whom however will present an equivalent level of difficulty and attainment. These tasks focus on the development of further transferable skills by the students, such as working with online code repositories (e.g. GitHub), running experiments on the Cloud, starting with AI programming, or critiquing existing work.<br />
<br />
Students will be given guidelines on the assessment and will have the opportunity to ask questions about them online. They will work on the coursework also along their instructor during the intensive day workshops, and will be able to ask questions about the relevant material online throughout the course.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" stlye="width:15%;">Feedback</td>
<td colspan="14">Students will be given formative feedback online, during and both prior and after the intensive days, which will feed forward into their final assessment.<br />
<br />
For each of the 2 pieces of coursework, while that coursework is released, and especially during the 2 weeks before the submission deadline for the respective coursework, the students will be able to share their solutions so far with the teaching staff (Lecturer and TA) and receive an evaluation with constructive feedback and advise. Where this can be done without allowing for plagiarism, the communication will be open to the class on the course's forum. Specifically for the majority of questions that are evaluated on the generated text, students will be able to share the generated text but not the steps followed to produce it (commands, setup, or self-authored text).<br />
<br />
Students will have access to technical support during the same timeline, helping them set up their environments and with executing commands for the coursework.<br />
<br />
In the intensive, students will also receive feedback from the teaching team and from their peers as they work through the activities. Students who are unable to attend the intensive will be able to ask questions in an online forum which the course TA and Lecturer will monitor and respond to.</td>
