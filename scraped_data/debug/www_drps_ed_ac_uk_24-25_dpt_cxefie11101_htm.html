<br />
Please Note:<br />
This course is only available to students enrolled on the Service Management and Design (MSc/PGD/PGC) degree.<br />
<br />
Service design methods have become an essential approach in bridging the values of multiple stakeholders to support the design and use of valued human-centred services. This course offers an introduction to, and critical approach to service design, with a focus on combining effective methods and frameworks toward practical application.</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    This course follows the EFI educational delivery model consisting of a pre-intensive period in which an introduction to the course and background materials will be shared, this is followed by a two-day intensive workshop in which the core materials will be delivered, with a final post-intensive period in which students are expected to work individually and in teams to develop assignments.<br />
<br />
Th individual, pre-intensive, period comprised of four elements:<br />
<br />
(i) A reading pack of 8 core papers that provides a background to the histories and development of the discipline.<br />
(ii) An introductory lecture (pre-recorded) that explains the structure of the course, and revisits the core papers to complete the background to the origins, development and applications of service design.<br />
(iii) Four practice-based case studies in the form of short videos that focus upon companies, practitioners and organisations that either provide design services, or have internal programmes and departments that use service design methods (e.g. Nile, Data + Design Lab, AndThen).<br />
(iv) Group tutorials where participants are able to discuss issues that emerge from the readings and case studies and familiarise themselves with key concepts ahead of the intensive days.<br />

(iv) Group tutorials where participants are able to discuss issues that emerge from the readings and case studies and familiarise themselves with key concepts ahead of the intensive days.<br />
<br />
The two-day intensive component combines learning and experiencing a selection of service design methods, followed by group work to plan the a selection of service design methods in response to a design brief. <br />
<br />
Summary of Day 1:<br />
<br />
(i) Short seminars will introduce established service design methods: e.g. service blueprints, journey mapping, Jobs To Be Done;<br />
(ii) Students will have the opportunity to practice these methods in the classroom applied in different contexts<br />
(iii) A collective feedback session will interrogate the applicability, potentials and limitations of each method.<br />
<br />
Summary of Day 2:<br />
<br />
(i) An introduction to service prototyping methods and approaches<br />
(ii) Students will be presented with a service management and design brief in which service design methods are required to be applied and adapted to a specific context;<br />
(ii) Students will work in groups to form 'design studios' consisting of online and offline members with different skills. Groups will work together to develop preliminary responses to the brief. Online tools including Miro will be used to support ideation and collaboration.<br />
(iii) Presentations back to the class will provide an opportunity for formative feedback in the review of different group responses to the brief. They will then use these plans to inform their development through the post-intensive phase.<br />
(iv) A final seminar will close the intensive two days and detail the expectations for the post-intensive period toward the final submission of coursework.<br />
<br />
Groups will remain connected throughout the post-intensive period which will consist of two elements:<br />
<br />
(i) Virtual studios will be self-organised by groups to pursue the group assignment, and will be facilitated through the provision of online tools linked to the assessment.<br />
(ii) Presentations delivered synchronously onsite and online, will provide an opportunity for groups to present their pitch, and receive formative feedback prior to a final submission. Asynchronous students will be able to contribute pre-recorded content and/or view recordings of the pitch and feedback.<br />
<br />
The student experience will integrate personal learning objectives within a group / studio environment. It will combine individual study together with structured tutor led workshops, a virtual studio culture, seminars and tutorials, toward the understanding and application of service design methods. It will link the work and personal experiences of the student together with the historical and contemporary discipline of service design and appreciate its application in the creation of inclusive human-centred services.<br />
<br />
Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:<br />
<br />
The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed. There will, however, be options to control whether or not your video and audio are enabled.<br />
<br />
As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.

<br />
The course will be assessed by means of the following assessment components:<br />
<br />
1) 1500 Word Reflective Essay (75%)<br />
<br />
Students will write a 1000 - 1500 word reflective essay to critique a service design method in relation to the brief provided during the intensive days. They will be expected to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of using this method in a particular domain, context, or with certain stakeholders.<br />
<br />
2) Group Presentation Slide Deck / PDF of a maximum 25 Pages (25%)<br />
<br />
Working in a group, they will be asked to produce a proposal to apply a selection of service design methods in response to a particular brief. The response would include a description of how and why particular methods would be used, a structure for the approach, with consideration for how different methods can be tailored to the brief. Alongside the reflective essay, this should examine students' understanding of how to apply existing methods to new and emerging social, economic and data-driven contexts.<br />

<td colspan="14">Feedback on the formative assessment may be provided in various formats, for example, to include written, oral, video, face-to-face, whole class, or individual. The course organiser will decide which format is most appropriate in relation to the nature of the assessment.<br />
<br />
Feedback on both formative and summative in-course assessed work will be provided in time to be of use in subsequent assessments within the course.<br />
<br />
Feedback on the summative assessment will be provided in written form via Learn, the University of Edinburgh's Virtual Learning Environment (VLE).<br />
<br />
Students will receive feedback at various points during the course:<br />
- During intensive days and group presentations (formative feedback);<br />
- By written feedback on their individual reflective essay, and their group work (summative feedback).</td>
