intersection of environment and development issues within the global South. Through on-campus lectures the course provides students with key research and methodological skills which are then put into practice during an off-campus field trip to Nepal*.<br />
<br />
Students will be introduced to the Nepali context during on-campus lectures and once there will meet with a range of people from government,<br />
development agencies, (I)NGOs, grassroots organisations, research institutions, and local communities. They will be introduced to projects, practices and processes related to issues such as water management, community forestry, adaptation to climate change, disaster management, and biodiversity<br />
conservation (exact topics and places may change year to year due to availability). Based on these initial interactions and insights, students will then design, develop and conduct small group research projects, facilitated by staff and in-country collaborators.<br />

*Field course locations may change for a variety of reasons, including security risks, increased costs or inability to access field locations. Any changes to the main destination of the field course will be announced as soon as possible*<br />

    Nepal<br />
Nepal offers a fascinating and unique context in which to explore the intersection of environmental management and international development. Despite its small size Nepal contains a huge variety of landscapes, habitats, biodiversity and people, from the glaciers and seasonal herders of the high Himalaya,<br />
to the forested Middle-Hills peopled by subsistence farmers, to the jungles and commercial agriculture of lowland Terai. Nepal is a hugely multicultural and multi-ethnic country, with 28 million people speaking between them 123 languages. Nepali society is based on a hierarchical caste-system, and whilst<br />
discrimination based on caste has been unlawful since the 1960s, caste and ethnicity remain the basis for continued and widespread marginalisation. Nepal has undergone huge political and constitutional shifts since the 1950s, moving from a Rana family autocracy, to harsh nationalism under the Panchayat regime, to multi-party democracy quickly followed by the 10 year long Maoist 'People's War', a Royal palace massacre, and finally the<br />
establishment of Nepal as a secular, democratic, federal, republican state in 2008. Nepal is currently establishing a new federal structure, offering on-going opportunity for Nepal's development and people; particularly in light of the devastating 2015 earthquakes.<br />
<br />
Nepal is the 16th poorest country in the world and the second poorest in Asia (after Afghanistan), with 23% of the population living on less than $1.25 a day. High unemployment means that about 1,500 Nepalis migrate for work every day to countries such as the Gulf states, Malaysia and India. It comes as no surprise that Nepal has experienced intense attention from the international development community, interested not only in promoting economic<br />
development but in addressing social inequalities and governance. Given that most Nepalis live in rural areas and practice subsistence agriculture and<br />
land-based activities for a living, much international development work has an environmental focus, from agriculture in the face of climate change to water management and irrigation, from energy provision to disaster management, and from community forestry to protected area management and<br />
conservation. Urban populations are expanding rapidly, bringing additional challenges in cities and major towns; whilst out-migration from rural areas is altering the ways in which communities engage with their environments across rural Nepal. Endogenous civil society, social movements, scholars and activists are also hugely active across Nepal, although typically enjoy far less power and influence when brought together with international actors, who<br />
dominate negotiations, such as those over the operalisation of REDD+ in Nepal. The interplay of these Nepali environments and actors - from rural farmers and marginalised communities, to grassroots organisations and international agencies - along with their agendas, narratives and programmes of action, will provide students a fascinating case-study through which to understand more about the lived experiences, struggles and contradictions of environment and development in practice.<br />
