<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    1) Academic description Digital transformation in health and care depends on a wide range of factors. These include strategic development, service redesign, managing organisational culture and structures, management models (policies, practices, and processes), tools and technologies, behavioural and attitudinal change in service users and other stakeholders. This course highlights the importance of effective leadership, understanding organisational contexts, workflows and routines, and user cultures and preferences when designing, planning, and implementing digital transformation. It offers practical tools and strategies for learners to enable successful adoption, scalability, and sustainability of digital transformation and to enable innovation and informed decision making for current and future health and care services.<br />
2) Outline Content This course introduces the main theories and concepts associated with digital transformation, leadership, change management and communication and relates them to the digital transformation of health and care services. The course introduces the key concepts of digital transformation, it explores the drivers, barriers, and facilitators of digital transformation, and offers and overview of digital implementation challenges affecting health and social care delivery. Thus, by highlighting how digital transformation can benefit both professionals and citizens to enable the delivery of high quality, person-centred, efficient, sustainable health, and care services. The course further explores effective leadership approaches and capabilities of both leaders and their teams, using reflection and collaborative approaches including, co-production and networking opportunities. It explores theoretical foundations regarding change management and communication, exploring organisational readiness for change and digital transformation in the work environment and signposts to evidence-based methods and tools to support effective change management approaches. Throughout the course we will be drawing on examples from the evidence and health and care services.<br />
3) Student Learning Experience Students will learn from experts who work in or teach about leading and managing digital transformation. The course will clearly set the proposed learning objectives, learning resources, learning strategies and ways to capture evidence of achievement. Students will be expected to identify a suitable and willing mentor, within their work environment, to support them along the learning pathway. This will involve articulating a learning contract that stipulates expected commitment and input from the learner and their mentor. The course content is delivered online and is divided into four two week and one week sessions/topic areas including a reading week. Teaching sessions will be composed of written materials and video presentations, accompanied by guided reading in the form of links to journal articles and other web-based resources. These include national and international reports, policies and strategies, with the knowledge gained being used in conjunction with reflective exercises and problem-based learning questions. Discussion of the content and reading materials will be posted to an online forum, along with students' answers to the problem-based learning questions. Course tutors will moderate discussion boards. Summative assessment feedback will be provided at the end of the course. Students will be graded on a recorded presentation related to a digital transformation and a group project related to a choice of topic from either leadership or change management. They will also be expected to maintain a reflective account of their learning for the group project.

Formative feedback is generated to engage learners to constantly reflect on how they can approach, orient, and evaluate learning, which leads to successful learning outcomes. Summative feedback provides an evaluation of how much a student has learned at the end of the course through a final assessment. Formative feedback will be provided throughout the course, for example, during live question and answer sessions, and discussion boards. Students summative assessed course work will be marked, and feedback is provided within fifteen working days (where possible).</td>

<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" width="15%">Graduate Attributes and Skills</td>
<td width="85%">1) Mindsets<br />
Enquiry and lifelong learning<br />
Students on this course will promote personal commitment to continuing professional development. They will be encouraged to seek out ways to develop their expertise in leadership and change management through exploration, challenging, reflecting, and practicing existing and acquired knowledge and skills. They will also be encouraged to strive for excellence in their professional practice and to use knowledge, evidence, and research as integral to their decision making, as it relates to developing, planning, and implementing digital transformation.<br />
<br />
Aspiration and personal development<br />
Students will be encouraged to draw on the quality, depth, and breadth of their experiences to expand their potential and identify areas they wish to develop and grow. They will promote the recognition of the skills and capabilities of the informatics workforce in the health and care services. Students will also be encouraged to understand their responsibility within and contribute positively, ethically, and respectfully to the health and care community while acknowledging that different students and community members will have other priorities and goals.<br />
<br />
Outlook and engagement<br />
Students will be expected to take responsibility for their learning. Students will be asked to use their initiative and experience, often explicitly relating to their professional, educational or experience to engage with and enhance the learning of other students on the programme. Students will also be asked to reflect on the experience of their peers and identify opportunities to enhance their learning.<br />
<br />
2) Skills<br />
Research and enquiry<br />
Students will use self-reflection to seek out learning opportunities. Students will also use the newly acquired knowledge and critical assessment to identify and creatively tackle problems and assimilate the findings of primary research and peer knowledge in their arguments, discussions, and assessments. <br />
<br />
Personal and intellectual autonomy<br />
Students will be encouraged to use their personal and intellectual autonomy to critically evaluate learning materials and exercises. Students will be supported through their active participation in self-directed learning, discussion boards and collaborative activities to critically evaluate concepts, evidence and experiences of peers and superiors from an open-minded and reasoned perspective.<br />
<br />
Personal effectiveness<br />
Students will need to be effective and proactive learners that can reflect and articulate what they have learned, and have an awareness of their strengths and limitations, and a commitment to learning and reflection to complete this course successfully.<br />
<br />
Communication<br />
Effective leaders in the health and care services require excellent oral and written communication, presentation, and interpersonal skills. The structure of the interactive (reflective exercises, problem-based learning examples, discussion boards and collaborative activities) and assessment elements incorporate constant reinforcement and development of these skills.</td>
