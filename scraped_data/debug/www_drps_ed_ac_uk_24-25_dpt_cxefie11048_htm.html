<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">From highland Asia to Canada, and from Hawaii to New Zealand, Indigenous peoples are increasingly making their voices heard. They are finding new ways to build an inclusive and fairer society around notions of trust, tradition, guardianship, and protection. Using three themes - sovereignty, ecology and repatriation - and developing and exploring data driven case studies, the course will put in context the long legacy of colonialism, the predicaments around international rights, and the innovative ways in which Indigenous peoples are engaging with the world. <br />
<br />
Reconsidering what constitutes 'data', and how might we expand our notion of evidence, is the key to understanding Indigenous Futures. Data should not only be seen as a derivative that informs government policy, but as being about how we navigate knowledge that includes dreams, prophecies, protests, and public debates, and how Indigenous peoples deliberate on issues through peoples' councils, consultations, and customary laws.</td>

<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    This course offers a conceptual and practical way of rethinking the place of Indigenous peoples in the world today through three data driven case studies: <br />
<br />
(1) Sovereignty; <br />
(2) Ecology; <br />
(3) Repatriation. <br />
<br />
Central to the course is expanding on notions of data, engaging with diverse ways we can complicate and nurture its production. The course organiser will choose three case studies for the intensive workshop, engaging with key stakeholders via online and in-person discussion. The course will involve independent reading and discussions with cohort and course tutors, participation in a group project and video presentation, engagement with the course organiser and invited speakers, including leading group discussion, and completing a final essay. <br />
<br />
Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:<br />
<br />
The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities.<br />
<br />
Students should be aware that:<br />
- Classrooms used in this course will have additional technology in place: students might not be able to sit in areas away from microphones or outside the field of view of all cameras.<br />
- Unless the lecturer or tutor indicates otherwise you should assume the session is being recorded.<br />
<br />
As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.

<td colspan="14">Summative Assessment:<br />
<br />
The course will be assessed by means of the following components:<br />
<br />
1) Group Presentation (30%)<br />
<br />
This is a team-based analysis based on one of the three themes and will receive a single group mark.  Each video presentation will be 10-12 minutes in length. It will use course material and data gathered from desk-research by the group in phase of the course. The output will be prepared as a pre-recorded video presentation and relevant guidance on how to compile such a group video will be provided. The group mark will be assessed based on their ability to integrate knowledge and research findings into a clear presentation, and their ability to think critically about course readings and other materials. Moreover, assessment will take into account the overall quality of the answers provided in response to the task, presentation skills, and teamwork skills (i.e. equal and fair distribution of workload). <br />
<br />
2) 1500 Word Individual Essay (70%)<br />
<br />
This will be an individual written essay that builds on the insights gained from the course. All students will pick a new case study and develop a written essay of 1500 words (70% of the course mark) modeled on an academic journal such as Anthropology Today. In some cases, students may continue with the same theme developed during phase 1 but with a different geographical focus and with a greater depth of focus. All essays will promote a debate around the practicalities of their particular case study and work at the interface between scholarly material and Indigenous peoples' issues. <br />
<br />
Formative Assessment:<br />
<br />
Each course within Edinburgh Futures Institute includes the opportunity for you to participate in a formative feedback exercise or event which will help you prepare for your summative assessment. The formative assessment does not contribute to your overall course mark.<br />
<br />
Formative written feedback will be given during online contributions in phase 1 of the course and during small group discussions, to facilitate and strengthen the group presentations. Formative feedback will also be provided orally during group work on the 2-day intensive period, where teaching staff will comment on students' contributions.</td>

<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" stlye="width:15%;">Feedback</td>
<td colspan="14">Feedback on the formative assessment may be provided in various formats, for example, to include written, oral, video, face-to-face, whole class, or individual. The course organiser will decide which format is most appropriate in relation to the nature of the assessment.<br />
<br />
Feedback on both formative and summative in-course assessed work will be provided in time to be of use in subsequent assessments within the course.<br />
<br />
Feedback on the summative assessment will be provided in written form via Learn, the University of Edinburgh's Virtual Learning Environment (VLE).<br />
<br />
Summative Assessment:<br />
<br />
Written summative feedback will be given following group presentations and the written assessment.<br />
