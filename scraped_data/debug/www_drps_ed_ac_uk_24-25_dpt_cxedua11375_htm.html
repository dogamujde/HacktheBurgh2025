<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">Developing Teacher Professionalism (DTP) is a 60 credit core which runs throughout the entire two-year MSc programme. It is assessed via two 30 credit courses; one in each year of the programme. In DTP, students are introduced to ideas that support an activist conception of teacher professionalism; an activist conception being one that sees teaching as a transformative profession, where the teacher works collaboratively and transparently to enhance children's learning experiences and life chances. <br />
Central to this course, and to the programme as a whole, is the notion of professional authenticity, and this course therefore seeks to support students to develop their own professional identity and capacity in ways that might be expected of fully-qualified teachers. DTP focuses on four key themes: self and others; and teacher as inquirer; teacher as pedagogical expert; teacher as learner.</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    The DTP course has been designed to be a professionally authentic experience, aligning itself with, and pushing forward, current policy thinking in Scotland on teacher education. In particular, the course supports several themes arising from &quot;Teaching Scotland's Future&quot; (Donaldson, 2011), namely: a reconceptualised approach to 'teacher professionalism'; greater partnership between universities, schools and local authorities and professional learning at Masters level.<br />
<br />
The conceptualisation of the programme as a whole draws on international research on teacher education, which suggests that 'The most powerful programs require students to spend extensive time in the field throughout the entire program, examining and applying the concepts and strategies they are simultaneously learning about in their courses' (Darling-Hammond, 2006, p. 307). The DTP course actively supports that endeavor by providing an explicit link between different sites of learning (university and school/community) which focuses on the central aim of developing teacher professionalism. Through the DTP course, and its attention to how teachers learn, students will be able to make explicit their own pedagogical aims, engaging in constructivist, critically-informed and transparent teaching which reflects the activist conception that we wish our students to aspire to and enact. <br />
<br />
The placing of clusters of students in school clusters for site-based learning will enable them to develop their identity as a teacher in a way that takes cognisance of the environment in which their pupils live and learn, providing opportunities for students to work with parents and other professional as well as a broad range of teachers. The DTP course will support students in mapping and planning their professional learning in the programme as a whole, against a developing personal philosophy of teaching with transformative aims at its core.<br />
<br />
The DTP course has four central elements that run throughout:<br />
<br />
SELF AND OTHERS<br />
Understanding and articulating own professional values and identity, understanding and articulating 'the cultural self', understanding others through theories of sociology and social justice, developing activist practices for social justice.<br />
<br />
TEACHER AS INQUIRER<br />
Concept of 'inquiry as stance' (Cochran Smith &amp; Lytle, 2009), developing professional research skills, problematising practice, adopting an activist stance to research and inquiry.<br />
<br />
TEACHER AS PEDAGOGICAL EXPERT<br />
Understanding different pedagogical approaches, e.g. pedagogies of place, early years pedagogies, critical pedagogy, culturally responsive pedagogy, restorative practices.<br />
<br />
TEACHER AS LEARNER<br />
Understanding teachers as learners: processes of professional, lifelong learning, policy context for professional learning, developing reflective and planning skills, developing professional networks within and beyond the programme, including international links.<br />
<br />
DTP will be taught principally through seminar-based activities, requiring students to have undertaken reading, observation and other activities in their cluster schools. Students will be supported by tutors, peers and school-based colleagues to engage critically with the GTCS Standard for Provisional Registration throughout the course, planning, reflecting on, and evidencing their progress as they build towards the final professional viva in which they will present evidence of having met the Standard for Provisional Registration.<br />
<br />
The course will comprise 9 hours of whole group teaching and 21 hours of smaller group teaching. Students will engage in 105 hours of site-based learning and 165 hours of self/group study.<br />
