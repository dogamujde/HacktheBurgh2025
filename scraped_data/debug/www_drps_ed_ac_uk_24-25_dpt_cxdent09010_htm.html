Case Based Learning<br />
These meetings are introduced in year one, semester two which is more relevant at this stage in the programme as you begin to treat patients.  <br />
<br />
The content of these meetings include:<br />
-	Medical emergency scenarios<br />
-	Discussion of clinical scenarios<br />
-	Role playing:  patient/clinician communication <br />
-	Evidence based dentistry<br />
-	Clinical quizzes<br />
<br />
Occasionally, Case Based Learning meetings are attended by more than one year group. Teaching staff allocate breakout groups and each group are given clinical, patient management or medical emergency scenarios to discuss.<br />
This encourages communication and interaction between year groups and aligns with the schoolÂ¿s peer support project: Academic Families.<br />
<br />
Journal Club<br />
These meetings are introduced in year one, semester one. You will be sent a list of suggested scientific papers, then as a group a decision is made on which paper you would like to discuss at the next meeting. The meetings are facilitated by a University Senior Researcher who is based within the Edinburgh Dental Institute.<br />
Journal Club encourages you to read a wider range of scientific literature which also develops your critical analysis skills in preparation for your Literature Review and dissertation your senior honour year.<br />
<br />
Reflective Portfolios<br />
These meetings are also introduced in year one, semester two as it allows you to build up a reflective account of your clinical practice and clinical observation sessions. This is very much student led and you are responsible for the completion of your daily logs.  The meetings are facilitated by a Personal Tutor who is able to lead and direct the discussions.
