 The International Risk Governance Council (IRGC) defines risk governance as &quot;the identification, assessment, management, and communication of risks in a broad context. It includes the totality of actors, rules, conventions, processes, and mechanisms concerned with how relevant risk information is collected, analysed, and communicated; and how and by whom management decisions are taken and implemented.&quot; There are many approaches to risk governance and regulation, which largely reflects the different levels of risk, uncertainty and potential benefits of specific types of science, technology or socio-economic activity within or across a diverse range of sectors or 'risk fields'.<br />
 The application of any new technology, process or industry must have a carefully considered process of risk governance to mitigate risk of harm, and ideally in a way that does not hinder innovation. This introductory course on key concepts of risk governance and regulation is both a key component of the MSc BIG Programme, but will also appeal to students with more general interests in science, technology, management, policymaking and governance seeking a general introduction to the basic concepts, theory and practice of risk, governance and regulation.</td>

    Risk governance and regulation is a fundamental component of virtually all scientific and technological fields, whilst also being intrinsic to a variety of social and economic processes. There are many different approaches to risk governance and regulation, which largely reflects the different levels of risk, uncertainty and potential benefits of specific types of science, technology or socio-economic activity within or across a diverse range of sectors or Â¿risk fieldsÂ¿. The application of any new science, technology or process must have a carefully considered process of risk governance to mitigate risk of harm, and ideally in a way that does not hinder innovation. <br />
The main aim of this course is to introduce students to the key concepts and practices surrounding risk-governance and regulation processes as they might be applied to a range of industries, technological sectors, and socio-economic issues, as well as enable students to begin characterising and critiquing different models of good risk governance in different contexts. The course will provide a generic introduction to the key concepts, theories and approaches to risk assessment, governance and regulation (including anticipatory risk governance, integrative risk governance, responsible research and innovation and risk-benefit analysis) and also explore the issue of how to manage emerging and complex risks; for example in the context of insurance practices. Students will be introduced to the challenges and bottlenecks in different types of risk-governance processes, as well as key theoretical, conceptual and empirical evidence through which to examine systemic issues around risk and uncertainty. <br />
<br />
Outline Content<br />
<br />
1.	Introduction to the Concepts of Risk, Risk-Assessment and Uncertainty <br />
Introductory session to  explore some of the basic concepts of risk, risk-analysis and uncertainty through an historical look at the development of probability theory and insurance practices from the middle ages to the present day 'risk society' coined by Ulrich Beck.<br />
2.	Understanding Different Models of Risk-Governance and Regulation<br />
This session will elaborate and critique some of the different formal models of risk-governance and regulation that have emerged in recent decades to manage uncertainty and control risks associated with scientific and technological developments in a variety of technological fields. Starting with a critical exploration of the framework developed by the International Risk Governance Council (IRGC), it will consider the benefits and limitations of 'anticipatory', 'integrative', 'tentative' and 'adaptive' forms of risk governance and their implications for risk management, innovation and upstream engagement.<br />
3.	The Roles of Evidence and Expertise in Managing Risk and the Science-Policy Interface<br />
This session will take an in-depth look at the role that evidence and expertise plays in risk-governance and regulatory processes, illustrated by examples such as the UK regulation of life assurance practices, amongst others.<br />
4.	Multi-Level and Networked Regulation and Governance for Emerging Risks <br />
This session focuses on broader issues around the role and limits to governance and regulatory processes, with particular emphasis on changing institutional dynamics and the interplay between, and implications of, an ever growing number of different actors becoming embedded in risk-assessment, governance and regulatory structures. In this context, we will explore the concept of 'networked governance' through the case study of the financial crisis. <br />
5.	Climate Change: A Case Study of a Risk Governance Process<br />
 This session will think through all of the key elements of the course to critically explore the case study of Climate Change as an example of a complex risk-field that has engendered a multi-level risk governance and regulatory process.<br />
<br />
This course is delivered through a 5-week lecture and seminar discussion format. The two-hour sessions will typically consist of a short lecture (introducing the key themes of the week's topic and the core readings provided), followed by an hour and a quarter of classroom discussion and/or student-led presentations. Each week's class will typically cover conceptual, theoretical and empirical material related to the topic. Discussion with staff and with others on the course is a key element in learning. Most of the students on the course are new to the field, and are expected to bring with them a wide variety of perspectives and experiences.<br />
