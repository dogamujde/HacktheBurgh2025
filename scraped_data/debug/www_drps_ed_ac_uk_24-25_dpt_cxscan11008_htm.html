<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">This course is about how we may understand our relationship with the past. Engaging with a growing body of anthropological work, and research done in related disciplines, which has emphasised the collective nature of memory, and the social construction of the past, it looks at how the past is understood, experienced, remembered and represented in different ethnographic contexts in the present. Memory, history, and 'oral traditions' will be examined as different but related means of understanding, representing and politicising the past, alongside other, less discursive means of relating to the past, such as through performance, objects, bodies and landscape.<br />
<br />
Engaging with more recent arguments that have emphasised the limits to the 'invention' of history, the course will consider how the study of 'the past' inevitably involves not only notions of time and temporality, but also of landscape, space and place, and artefacts, bodies, practice, things and materiality. The politics of the past is in no way limited to how we understand or represent it; it is also finely related to questions of what to do with its materiality - in the form of archaeological remains, ruins and heritage sites, objects and artefacts, bodies and bones, monuments and memorials.<br />
<br />
With reference to a variety of empirical examples and broader theoretical trends, lectures will explore the politics of the past through the following topics: Time and denial of co-evalness; nationalism and identity; memory and forgetting; commemoration and memorials; heritage and museums; landscape and place; ruins, ruination and affect; artefacts and bones; and kinship, performance and ritual.</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    Outline Content:<br />
<br />
1. Inventing histories<br />
In the first lecture we will tackle the proposition that is suggested in the title for this course: that history, our stories of the past, are 'invented' and that this processes of invention is bound-up with the politics of identity and, in particular, is indivisible from modern articulations of national (or sub-state national) identities.<br />
<br />
2. The past in the present<br />
In this lecture we will consider the anthropology of time and the problem of the relationship between the past and the present. Focussing on key debate within Anthropology (1996), we will explore the seeming contradiction inherent in the notion of the 'invention of history' that the past is theoretically constituted as being at once determining yet determined.<br />
<br />
3. Collective memory<br />
Following on from the previous lecture, we will discuss the problem of the presence of the past with particular reference to 'memory' and especially collective, or social, memory. We will find a pathway through the vast literature on collective memory, which shares an emphasis on the ways that our memories of past events are socially constituted in the present.<br />
<br />
4. Landscapes and ruins<br />
This lecture focuses on the temporality of landscape and the ways in which the past inhabits, or is said to inhabit, the material fabric of the world around us. We will particularly focus on ruins.<br />
<br />
5. Ghosts and the return of the repressed<br />
A with ruins, ghosts and 'the spectral' are enjoying something of theoretical vogue. This lecture will discuss some of the reasons for this popular and academic interest in ghosts. Building on the previous lectures, we will consider the proposition that ghosts are an affective experience of the unbidden return of a past, often, traumatic and violent, that has been repressed, or 'forgotten', within normative narrations of a shared history.<br />
<br />
6. Exhuming bodies and bones<br />
This lecture will consider the exhumation of bodies and bones and the ways in which the process of exhumation is enfolded into contemporary politics of memory and forgetting, particularly in situations where people are living with the legacy of traumatic, often state-sponsored, violence.<br />
<br />
7. Museums, Anthropology, Empires <br />
This lecture will consider the historical and contemporary practice of material culture within both the museum and the discipline of anthropology. The contemporary museum, particularly national museums, emerged from the activities and conquests of the European colonial empires. We will discuss how this legacy is or should be represented within the contemporary space of the museum and how anthropology should engage with these issues, particularly in relation to institutional and individual collections of objects. <br />
<br />
8. Intangible Cultural Heritage<br />
The tensions and debates around the collection of material objects have contributed to attempts to differentiate between Tangible and Intangible Cultural Heritage Â¿ the latter term coined to refer to less durable objects, as well as narratives, embodied skills, and cultural expressions associated with specific times and places.  Valuing the intangible places emphasis on the transmission and protection (rather than merely conservation) of cultural knowledge and ways of life.  But this processual approach is complicated by the fact that some cultural expressions Â¿ in this lecture, music in particular Â¿ blur the boundaries between the tangible and intangible.  The lecture will focus on complexities and contestations surrounding Intangible Cultural Heritage, as nation-states compete to have cultural expressions recognised as unique, valuable and worthy of protection.<br />
<br />
9. Visiting the past<br />
Nowadays, in the words we want to be affected by the past. Indeed, we will go to great lengths and are willing to spend huge amounts of money to have ourselves affected by the past. This lecture is about the lengths we will go and the money we will spend to experience the past. We discuss heritage tourism, the commodification of history and the possibility of visiting the past.<br />
<br />
10. Dark tourism and cosmopolitan memory<br />
To conclude the course, and following on from the discussion of heritage tourism, the final lecture will explore the phenomena of 'dark tourism' in order to discuss the future of the study of the invention of history and collective memory in the context of globalisation and cosmopolitanism.<br />
<br />
Student Learning Experience:<br />
<br />
This is hands on and intensive course in which students will learn through a mixture of lectures, 'homework' exercises and in-class discussions. There will be a weekly two hour lecture, and this will be supported by a one hour small group seminar for postgraduate students that will take place every second week.<br />
<br />
Beyond the classroom learning experience the course organiser warmly encourages one to one discussions about issues relating to the course content and the students own academic interests.
