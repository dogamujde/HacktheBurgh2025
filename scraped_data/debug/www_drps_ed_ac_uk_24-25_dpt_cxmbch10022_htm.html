<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">During Year 6 - Preparation for Practice students will become accustomed to assisting a doctor in a clinic or surgery, a ward, or operating theatre, and will become a valued member of the health-care team. By the end of the year students will be prepared to start Canadian Residency Programme. <br />
<br />
The year is organised into four blocks each of 4 weeks followed by Finals exams and then a further 12 weeks for the Assistantship and Elective. There are vacations in semester 1 and 2.<br />
<br />
Over the summer between Year 5 and Year 6, students are completing the Alberta attachment which includes the General Practice (Family Medicine) and General Medicine (General Internal Medicine) components of the Year 6 course. There is opportunity for Canadian or North American elective attachments during this time period. Students will undertake Emergency Medicine, Acute Medicine, Surgery, Anaesthetics and Critical Care on return to Edinburgh. Students may need to return to Canada for residency interviews.  Following final Exams, students undertake the Assistantship. Elective is undertake in summer prior to returning to Edinburgh for Year 6. <br />
<br />
The attachments during Preparation for Practice are broad-based in medicine, surgery and primary care, and students will consolidate and expand their abilities to manage patients presenting with symptoms in any system, including emergencies. <br />
<br />
There are opportunities for formative feedback throughout the Course.<br />
<br />
The Final Exams comprise written, practical and oral assessments during January/February. In addition students are required to take formative progress tests and complete the Alberta attachment satisfactorily. Students are expected to demonstrate a professional approach to their studies and conduct.</td>

<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    The Modules include Medicine (General Internal Medicine), General Practice (Family Medicine), Surgery, Anaesthetics, Critical Care, Emergency Medicine and Acute Medicine and Assistantship.<br />
<br />
The teaching and learning experiences are varied and include: interactive lectures, large group interactive plenaries, small group tutorials, directed reading using a range of materials including online lectures and computer based learning packages, resuscitation, clinical skills and communication workshops, clinical teaching in GP surgeries, clinics, wards, operating theatres, imaging and investigative labs. <br />
 <br />
Throughout Year 6 students are expected and encouraged to adopt an apprenticeship role under supervision, as much as possible. There are many opportunities to get involved in the care of patients though students must be proactive to make the most of them. There is support and guidance in the form of learning outcomes and core content as usual. In addition the learning activities for each module, such as clerking patients and completing portfolio activities indicate what is required to ensure students are competent at FY1 level by the time of graduation. There are few lectures and tutorials in Year 6, other than 'bedside' teaching, but there will be guided reading and many online resources. The portfolio case summaries continue to encourage students to explore patients' needs in depth and to synthesise and summarise these needs and clinical management succinctly to colleagues. At the end of modules tutors review evidence of performance with students and provide additional written and verbal narrative comments on general progress, with suggestions for developments. <br />
 <br />
During the Assistantship, students are expected to undertake the tasks of the FY1 doctor under close supervision, to help them transfer their learning to everyday clinical practice and to gain confidence before starting work as FY1 doctors. The SSC 6 (Elective) gives students an opportunity to travel and explore clinical practice in another part of the country or the world. Students are reminded not to take on tasks beyond their competence, but the exact experiences and practical work will vary depending where they choose to go. <br />
<br />
During the Alberta attachment students are expected to undertake the tasks of the doctor under close supervision, to help them transfer their learning to everyday clinical practice and to gain confidence before starting work as doctors.<br />
 <br />
There are many other opportunities for feedback, described below. Students are expected to reflect on this feedback, discuss it with their Undergraduate Supervisors (or the Year Director) and use it to further direct and regulate their own learning.

<td>
    On completion of this course, the student will be able to:
    <ol style="font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;">
        <li>As a scholar and scientist, apply the principles, methods and knowledge of the relevant disciplines of academic study to medical practice, and take a scholarly and scientific approach to medical research and to improving patient care and health service delivery. More specifically: 1. Biomedical Sciences (BMS) apply to medical practice the biomedical scientific principles, method and knowledge relating to relevant sciences including anatomy, biochemistry, cell biology, genetics, immunology, microbiology, molecular biology, nutrition, pathology and physiology. 2. Psychological Aspects of Medicine (PAM) recognise and assess important psychological and behavioural aspects of health, illness and disease; and respond appropriately to these aspects, using strategies such as explanation, advice and reassurance to address them. 3. Social Sciences and Public Health (SSPH) implement, at a clinical level, knowledge of how to understand the experience of illness and illness behaviour; to prevent disease, prolong life and promote health through the organised efforts of society; and demonstrate understanding of how to analyse a population's health problems, establish the causes and effects of these problems and assist appropriately in implementing effective solutions. 4. Evidence-Based Medicine and Research (EBM&amp;R) use the best available medical evidence, found through a systematic search and appraisal of the relevant information sources, to inform clinical decisions; and develop new knowledge or personal understanding through the application of basic research methods and skills.</li><li>2.	As a practitioner, undertake initial assessment, management, review and ongoing care of patients safely, under supervision proportionate to the clinical situation, and seeking help from colleagues appropriately. More specifically: 5. The Consultation (TC) undertake an effective and efficient consultation that is sensitive to the needs of the patient. 6. Presentation, Diagnosis and Management (PDM) describe the modes of presentation and natural history of diseases, recognise and interpret the signs and symptoms with which people present to doctors, construct a differential diagnosis, and choose appropriate methods to investigate, treat and care for patients in a multi-professional setting. 7. Clinical Communication (CC) communicate clearly, sensitively and effectively with patients and their relatives, and with colleagues from the medical and other professions. 8. Emergency Care, Clinical and Resuscitation Skills (ECCARS) recognise and systematically assess acutely unwell patients and institute immediate management, including first aid and resuscitation, and perform a range of clinical skills and procedures safely and effectively. 9. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (CPT) describe how drugs act and apply this knowledge to clinical practice to prescribe clearly and accurately, to match appropriate drugs to the clinical context, to review the appropriateness of medication and to evaluate the potential benefits and risks. 10. Medical Informatics (MI) use computers, computing, information and information technology effectively in a medical context; and work effectively within the legal and professional constraints that relate to person-identifiable information.</li><li>3.	As a professional, take a reflective and self-directed approach to the study and practice of medicine, demonstrate professional judgment and adherence to the ethical, professional and legal responsibilities of a junior doctor in everyday practice, work in a multi-professional team, teach others, and continuously enhance patient care whilst paying attention to personal health, wellbeing and professional development. More specifically: 11. Medical Ethics, Legal And Professional Responsibilities (MELPR) practise medicine within an ethical framework, with insight and compassion, according to the legal requirements and professional expectations of medical practice in the UK. 12. Personal Professional Development (PPD) take a reflective and self-directed approach to the ongoing study and practice of medicine, work effectively in a team, and develop others' learning in order to enhance safe patient care, maximise effectiveness and enjoy career satisfaction.</li>
