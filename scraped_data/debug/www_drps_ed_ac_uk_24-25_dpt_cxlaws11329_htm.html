<br />
The course is deliberately designed to be open and responsive to issues that are current at the time of delivery in any given year. Accordingly, only broad indications as to topics and subject matter can be given is a description such as this. Likely issues to be covered include: <br />
<br />
(a)	start and end of life<br />
(b)	human genetics and biotechnologies<br />
(c)	regulation of medical research<br />
(d)	human enhancement<br />
(e)	artificial intelligence in healthcare<br />
<br />
The core aims of the course are:<br />
<br />
- To encourage critical awareness of current issues in a subject/discipline and one or more specialisms.<br />
- To support students in planning and executing a significant project of research, investigation or development<br />
- To foster originality or creativity in the application of knowledge, understanding and/ or practices<br />
- To ensure that students apply critical analysis, evaluation and synthesis to issues which are at the forefront of, or informed by, developments at the forefront of a subject/discipline<br />
- To require students to communicate, using appropriate methods, to a range of audiences with different levels of knowledge/expertise<br />
- To require students to communicate with peers, more senior colleagues and specialists<br />
- To encourage students to take responsibility for own work and/or significant responsibility for the work of others.<br />

    Indicative Teaching Programme<br />
<br />
Given the deliberately open and responsive nature of this course, it would be inappropriate to attempt to give concrete topics. The topics will be chosen with the class in any given year under the oversight and direction of the course teachers. A broad indication of contemporary live topics will be introduced by the course teachers and it will be for students to decide amongst themselves which areas they would like to explore further. Suggestions and proposals will be invited from the students. Group interaction in this process will be encouraged and this will then be used as a means to take learning forward. Groups will be assisted to choose topics, develop materials, prepare to lead on seminar discussions, and to encourage mutual learning. The first few sessions will be led by staff as exemplars of the kinds of critical approaches and insights that can be explored. Skills development is central the course and will form an early part of the course interaction.<br />
<br />
Thus, the overall outline of the course will have the following format:<br />
<br />
Part 1 - Skills development (Seminars 1-4)<br />
<br />
Seminar 1: Introduction: the course, expectations, overview of core topics in medical jurisprudence, likely topics and groups<br />
Seminar 2: Final topics selection and groups <br />
Seminar 3: Submission of preliminary reading lists/course handouts ahead of Seminar 3, to be discussed in class, and running order of seminars selected (final handouts to be submitted one day later, i.e. by 2pm Tuesday 26th January)<br />
Seminar 4: Key skills development in critical thinking: staff example<br />
<br />
Part 2 Exploring contemporary issues (weeks 5-10)<br />
<br />
(These will consist of student-led group seminars)<br />
<br />
Expectations for each seminar include:<br />
<br />
1)	Student-led seminar based on student-prepared reading material to be distributed in advance (topic and group selection in Seminar 2 and draft reading material distributed ahead of Seminar 3, as described above).<br />
<br />
2)	Clear learning objectives and conclusions to be prepared for each seminar.<br />
<br />
3)	Full preparation ahead of each seminar and participation in discussion by all in class.

<td colspan="14">The course will be assessed by way of the group seminar presentation (70%) and individual blogs (30%):<br />
<br />
1. 70% assessment by way of group seminar presentation, to be made up of: <br />
<br />
(i)	the distribution of a handout with various levels of reading material; <br />
(ii)	the content and structure of the seminar itself, including the ability to distil clear objectives and conclusions; and<br />
(iii)	clarity of division of labour and responsibility of tasks within group. <br />
<br />
Group work counts as an important part of the learning experience and assessment of this course. A single mark will be attributed to each group based on the quality of their handout materials and performance in class in leading their designated seminar. This mark stands for each individual in the group. It is the responsibility of everyone in the group to discuss and decide on a fair and equal division of labour to ensure that the mark is merited by everyone. To ensure that the distribution of labour is transparent to the course organiser, each student will submit - at the end of the course - an individual (max) two-page reflective report on the process of distributing, organising and delivering work within their group. The reflective report will be due (to be submitted on Learn) one week following the last class.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, to help each group in its tasks, the course staff will offer each group a dedicated tutorial prior to submission of the handout to discuss progress, the seminar itself, and any issues about fair allocation of work. In the very rare case that there is strong evidence that one or more individual has not been contributing fairly to their group, the matter (and their mark) will be referred to the external examiner for a final decision on whether and how their own mark might be lowered. All group seminars will be recorded on Collaborate. This recording will only be shared with fellow classmates on the course, the academic staff on the course, and the external examiner to ensure fairness in marking and parity between groups.   <br />
<br />
2. 30% by way of two (2) individual blogs, written and submitted by each of you. Each blog must be 1000 words each and submitted via the Journal platform on the course Learn page. Instructions on the blog writing process (including submission) will be released in due course. You have the choice to decide which 2 of the 6 student-led seminars you wish to write a blog on; it need not be the seminar you lead. It is strongly encouraged that these blogs be written throughout the semester -  not at the very end. You are strongly encouraged to submit your individual blog the same week following the relevant student-led seminar (seminars 5-10), i.e. by Friday each week, as the content of the seminar will be freshest in your mind, but the only deadline for submitting any and all blogs will be the final week of the course.<br />
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" stlye="width:15%;">Feedback</td>
<td colspan="14">Feedback on both formative and summative in-course assessed work will be provided in time to be of use in subsequent assessments within the course. The formative feedback events for this course will be:<br />
<br />
(1)	A group meeting with an individual member of staff at which the group and its members will have a chance to discuss the planning and presentation of their chosen topic. <br />
<br />
(2)	Each student will have the opportunity to post a formative blog based on the staff-led 'live example' Seminar 4 and to receive feedback on it prior to the series of student group-led seminars (thus there are two summative blogs and one formative blog in total).<br />
<br />
Feedback on the summative assessments (viz. the 4 blogs and student-led group seminar) will be provided in written form via Learn, the University of Edinburgh's Virtual Learning Environment (VLE).<br />
