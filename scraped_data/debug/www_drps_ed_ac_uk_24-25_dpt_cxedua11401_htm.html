This course will provide students with a background to language policies and their articulation with classroom practices in the upper primary and lower secondary stages.  The National Framework for Languages for Initial Teacher Education (2018) will be used to inform the development of such theory-policy-practice integration.  Throughout the course, students will learn how to design language rich learning environments which are inclusive and which meet the needs and interests of diverse learners.  Students on this course are graduates of Gaelic, Latin, and Modern Languages (e.g. French, Spanish, German).  However, school based experience in primary schools may afford opportunities to observe and plan for language activities in other languages, such as BSL.</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    The notion of building linguistic and social capital and ensuring young people's entitlement to develop a range of language (s) skills is fundamental to educational systems across the world. Language as a holistic concept and its role in education - both as a communication tool and as a learning tool - is at the core of learning. It is also complex and challenging. Language learning and using are open to wide (mis)interpretations leading to a range of different and at times conflicting pedagogic approaches.  Given the rapidly changing nature of learners and learning in schools in terms of first languages, cultures and life experiences, languages as a learning tool and as linguistic systems to be understood and progressed, demand critical analysis of plurilingual, pluriliteracies and pluricultural contributions.  In order to design socially just and equitable environments which prepare learners for global citizenship involves motivating and enabling learners to understand how language systems promote communication in socially and culturally diverse communities, across regions and nations, supported by transcultural awareness which make transparent inherent values and beliefs. In addition, the use of languages to promote literacies and cognitive development - regardless of the age and ability of the individual - requires safe, language-rich environments. A transformative languages teacher enables all learners to communicate appropriately, understand the value of language and languages for personal, societal and global benefit, and to learn how to use languages in increasingly demanding critical settings. To make this happen, students will be engaged in critical analysis of languages in use (including learning) in different communities, taking account of the diverse needs of learners and related issues of identities and successful learning. This will involve confident, analytical criticality in discussion and debate in the classroom and beyond.<br />
<br />
The OECD report (2015) demanded a 'new narrative' for Scotland's national curriculum. For languages to make a significant contribution to this narrative, critical evaluation and reconceptualization of the nature of language learning and teaching, its role in interdisciplinary settings and as a medium for learning is essential. This course seeks to develop teachers who are able to make use of their understanding of pedagogical and socio-cultural language knowledge and skills to design and teach in an inclusive and language-rich environment. Teachers undertaking this course will therefore develop critical and situated awareness of themselves in their role as a teacher - a role which is political, cultural, social and moral and about taking action. To this end the course is underpinned by theories of critical pedagogy and critical literacies.<br />
<br />
 Students on this course will learn how to critique relevant curricula at policy level in order to develop purposeful, engaging teaching.  Students will explore and develop their knowledge and understanding of the following areas of learning and teaching in language and interdisciplinary classrooms so that they can:<br />
<br />
 - analyse and critique curricula at policy level and at classroom level in order to develop purposeful, engaging teaching for learners from P5 - S3<br />
-  build on a widening understanding of integrated language theories, systemic functional linguistics, cultural and learning theories and use these to inform design principles for classroom practices  <br />
 - enable learners to learn to use languages, and use languages to learn, paying particular attention to the diverse cultural heritage of learners and their languages <br />
-  connect languages and literacies to wider learning across the curriculum<br />
-  design effective learning spaces which are language-rich and challenging, making learning progression transparent <br />
-  understand the role of languaging for meaning-making across languages and in a variety of multimodal ways.<br />
 - learn how to develop specific language skills (e.g. reading and writing) using cognitive functions in social and culturally appropriate and effective ways<br />
-  understand and demonstrate how assessment, when embedded in learning and teaching, can lead to deeper learning involving self, peers, teachers and others. <br />
-  develop understanding of assessment within the context of languages teaching in the broad general education<br />
-  begin the process of becoming a reflective and reflexive practitioner through early iterations of a theory of practice<br />
<br />
 Students taking this course will work in collaborative groups in seminars and in directed study time, both in university and in cluster sites. Learning will be problem-based and students will be expected to contribute extensively in seminar sessions.<br />
<br />
The course will comprise 10 hours of whole group teaching/ tutor contact. <br />
 Students will engage in 35 hours of site-based learning and 20 hours of directed study on campus.<br />
 Independent Learning of 35 hours completes the breakdown of learning and teaching activities. <br />
