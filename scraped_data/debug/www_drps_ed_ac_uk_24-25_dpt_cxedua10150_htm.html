The course will encourage students to critically evaluate psychology theory and research, and to take an evidence-based approach to understanding how psychology can inform education. Research methods, the process of conducting child development research, and the ethical issues involved will also be discussed. Students will be encouraged to reflect on how they can use their knowledge of child development to enhance their practice in engaging children in learning and supporting children's social development. Throughout the course the emphasis will be on understanding the child within their home, social and cultural contexts. The course team and invited guest speakers bring together research expertise in cognitive and social development, atypical development, and educational psychology. Throughout the course they will draw on their own research to highlight the important connections between psychological research and educational practice.</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    Academic description:<br />
This course is designed to provide student with an opportunity to extend their knowledge of a range of current psychological theories and research on cognitive and social child development. These topics may include, for example: attachment theory, executive function, memory and learning, neuroscience in Education, theory of mind development, the role of physical activity in cognitive development,  friendships and play. <br />
<br />
Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to reflect on their experience working with children (e.g. in schools) and to consider how the developmental psychology research fits with their own experiences, observations and reflections. Indeed, the links between psychological research/theories of children's development and educational policy and practice will be a central theme running throughout this course. Students will be encouraged to critically evaluate psychology theory and research, and to take an evidence-based approach to understanding the two-way relationship between developmental psychology and education. <br />
<br />
Throughout the sessions there will be discussion of both classic and recent research findings, and through this students will be provided with opportunities to reflect on developmental psychology research methods and ethics. Throughout the course, students are encouraged to consider development holistically, considering the two-way relationship between the individual and their environment (e.g. family) and the role that societal and cultural factors play in children's life experiences and development.<br />
<br />
Outline content:<br />
The course will be divided into ten sessions. The first eight of these sessions focus on a different aspect of child development and the links between psychological research/theory and education. Specific topics are likely to change from year to year, but may include: attachment theory, executive function, memory and learning, neuroscience in Education, theory of mind development, the role of physical activity in cognitive development,  friendships and play. The final sessions focus on formative assessment and summative assessment preparation.<br />
<br />
Student learning experience:<br />
In the weekly classes, students will be asked to engage with a range of learning experiences, including: interactive lecture content; discussion of video clips; small and whole group discussion; small group tasks; and (where possible) input from guest speakers.<br />
<br />
Outwith classes, students will be asked to undertake and reflect on reading before each class. Reading is likely to be a mixture of quantitative and qualitative research, but students will be provided with some support in critical reading of developmental psychology research. To support them in the course assignment, they will also be encouraged to engage with resources provided in class and via other sources (e.g. the Institute for Academic Development).<br />
<br />
Students will be expected to evidence and demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes via discussion, input into group activities, and, ultimately, in the formative and summative assignments.

<br />
Formative assessment<br />
There will be a formative assessment towards the end of the course: all students will be asked to present a poster which outlines their summative assignment plans, including:  topic, structure, key themes, brief background, summary of possible implications for education, and key references. Students will be provided with written feedback on this formative assessment by peers and members of the course team. Feedback will be designed to provide students with information on how to further develop their ideas in preparation for the summative assessment. Students are expected to engage with this feedback prior to submission of their summative assignment. Students will be provided with further guidance on these posters during the course.<br />
