This design course builds upon and advances the theoretical and critical approach that you will have established in prior landscape architectural study. For the majority of students on this course, your work will continue from the semester 1 course: Extended Landscape Architectural Design Exploration: Part 1. If you are entering the programme as a visiting student of landscape architecture you will be supported in developing a firm approach to the course syllabus that meets with your own areas of interest in the discipline.<br />
Within this studio we ask you to be ambitious in cementing your knowledge, skills and understanding by taking a clear and distinctive design enquiry forward to detailed design resolution. You are required to apply and demonstrate knowledge through different scales of propositional design in order to manifest a speculative future for a project site. You will be encouraged to take an integrative approach to design by considering physical, social, cultural and environmental aspects of the landscape holistically. In support of the advanced nature of this course, you will engage with specialist experts and practitioners in developing design proposals that integrate planting, materiality and construction techniques. On completion of the course you should feel confident that you have developed integrated knowledge in the science, planning, design, implementation and management of a large scale landscape based projects; you should be able to apply this knowledge, skills and understanding autonomously.</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    This design course focuses your knowledge attainment upon decision and proposal making in landscape architectural practice. Considerations of scale will be of primary concern as you bring your ideas into focus and begin to make bespoke proposals that can activate positive socio-ecological change in the landscape. Experimentation will be encouraged as a means to test your ideas and you will be asked to articulate a clear and specifically scaled design agenda.<br />
Deeply considered judgements about social and environmental change should be supported with applied decision making and you should be able to articulate design resolutions in both space and in time. You will be asked to situate your work in the specificity of a given site or sites and communicate original responses as to the use of materials, plants, water and topography. Lectures and seminars will support development of knowledge specific to detail design, materiality and plantingYou will be asked to communicate your ideas around programmatic intentions and define the meaning and significance of the human landscape experience. You will curate your work within a dedicated space in the studio environment and you should give very careful consideration to the way that you present the final assembly of your portfolio for your internal examination. You will be encouraged to inter-relate the final communication (verbal, visual) of the work to the design process that generated the proposals.

100% portfolio/exhibition<br />
Critically curated portfolio of work, which addresses analysis, interpretation and proposal making. The portfolio should demonstrate knowledge and understanding of how landscapes operate as dynamic systems. Design sensibility should be advanced through a range of scales demonstrating a clear and unique response to the specific concerns of the landscape of your study. The portfolio should be finely curated in a form that is pertinent to the purposes of exhibition and should be supported by a 150-word abstract communicating the overall proposal. You are encouraged to make three-dimensional work as part of your design experimentation and to document this as part of the staging of your portfolio.</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width="15%">Graduate Attributes and Skills</td>
<td width="85%">(Characteristic 1) The course will help students to develop knowledge that covers and integrates the main areas of the discipline of Landscape Architecture.<br />
(Characteristic 2) The graduate attributes that are identified under Characteristic 2 hold strong relevancies to the Landscape Institutes Â¿Elements and areas of practiceÂ¿ which provides a reference point for education in the profession ensuring that the Landscape Institutes educational systems are fit for purpose, and prepare individuals for their first steps in building a successful career.<br />
Through the learning experience students will be supported in deploying applied knowledge and will be encouraged to use a range of professional skills that would also be utilised in professional environments within practice.<br />
(Characteristic 3) students will plan and execute a significant project of design research and investigation and advance that thinking into the making of proposals that are relevant, sustainable and ultimately implementable.<br />
(Characteristic 4) within the studio environment students will be supported in using a range of routine skills as they apply to their own project ideas but will also be encouraged to develop advanced and specialist skills where they hold specific relevancy or will allow a student to take a highly original response to the landscape. The course will allow students to communicate their work with peers, more senior colleagues and specialists. The course will require students to present their work, visually and verbally and support will be given through the course in advancing vital skills around this characteristic.<br />
(Characteristic 5)  Exercise substantial autonomy and initiative in professional and equivalent activities. Students are asked to develop a clear standpoint and take a distinct and original response and actively manage their own approach so that it holds relevancy in both theory and practice. <br />
