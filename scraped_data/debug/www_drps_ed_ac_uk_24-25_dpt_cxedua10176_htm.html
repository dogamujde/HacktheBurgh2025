Each student will bring to this course a Personal &amp; Professional Learning Portfolio. Students, in the final year of the MA(PE) will be expected to attain the Standard for Provisional Registration (SPR) at the end of this 11 week placement.. Assessment criteria are  based on the assumption that Year 4 students are in the final stages of working towards achieving the SPR. The PDL2 course is underpinned by the following core dimensions aligned with professional values (GTCS, 2012): social justice, integrity, trust and respect.</td>

<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    This focus will be provided by a Curriculum for Excellence including Health &amp; Well Being.<br />
Students will be involved in varied aspects of school experience including teaching classes in S1- S6 under the aegis of a qualified teacher; observation of teaching; discussion with members of the PE department; attendance at departmental meetings and any other professional activities e.g. involvement, where feasible,  in extra-curricular activities deemed to be appropriate by the Principal Teacher and Student Regent. Expectations please note: this placement is the Year 4 students' first experience of engaging with upper school certificate course secondary school. It is expected that students will require considerable support as they begin their journey to becoming a teacher of PE. While they should demonstrate competence in all three areas of professional practice and take full responsibility for their own classes it is expected that opportunities to observe and team teach will be part of the process that enables them to best achieve their potential. It is also expected that PDL2  will offer opportunities for a very gradual introduction to teaching within upper school certificated courses comprising observation, team teaching and only if the student and department feel enough progress has been made, leading S5-6 certificated classes.<br />

<td colspan="14">During PDL2 tutors, will in normal circumstances, visit twice during which time they will observe the student teaching and facilitate discussion with regards to the studentsÂ¿ progress. When the students is having difficulties, short term targets will be agreed and an additional visit arranged by the tutor. In the event that these difficulties continue a further visit by either the course leader or, another experienced tutor will be arranged. During PDL2 an interim formative assessment of the studentÂ¿s progress will be formulated with a view to enabling realistic targets to be set which support the student in working towards a Â¿satisfactoryÂ¿ outcome. A final summative report will be completed by the school to be discussed with tutors  (and/or personal  tutor) with a view to supporting their  personal  and  professional development, on the students return to University. External examiners will visit a range of schools towards the end of PDL2 with a view to engaging with all parties, identifying good practice and offering suggestions for improvement where appropriate. Students will be assessed against the Standard for Provisional Registration but with consideration given to the stage that he/she is at in their ITE Programme. Detailed evidence should be provided to support assessment within each of the three areas (Professional Values &amp; Personal Commitment, Professional Knowledge and Understanding, Professional Skills &amp; Abilities).<br />
<br />
To successfully overtake the demands of PDL2 an overall Â¿satisfactoryÂ¿ grade in all three areas must be awarded by both school and tutor. A Â¿satisfactoryÂ¿ is awarded if the student has made sufficient progress for this stage of development, with an appropriate level of support. An Â¿unsatisfactoryÂ¿ is awarded if the student has not made sufficient progress, for this stage of development, even with support.<br />
<br />
Progression If studentsÂ¿ do not achieve a Â¿satisfactoryÂ¿ by the end of PDL2 they are under normal circumstances, entitled to a re-sit opportunity. While, it would be desirable to facilitate this re-sit in time for the student to commence the induction year with their cohort, this is not feasible at a number of levels. In the summer time, schools are not able to offer the range of activities or classes deemed suitable for a final placement designed to enable students to achieve the standard for provisional registration. Consequently, re-sits would be scheduled for August to November of the year in which the Â¿unsatisfactoryÂ¿ was recorded. Measures, have been put in place to ensure that a student gaining a Â¿satisfactory Â¿ re-sit is available to teach from the subsequent January and ready to commence their induction in the August of that year.<br />

<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" stlye="width:15%;">Feedback</td>
<td colspan="14">A range of teaching and learning strategies should be adopted to support the student-teacher as they develop their personal, professional and leadership skills and abilities. It is anticipated that learning will be supported by observing and reflecting on good practice, team teaching, leading micro teaching scenarios and gradually leading and taking full responsibility for classes within the lower school (S1-2). To encourage the student-teacher to develop their specialist knowledge of their subject area they are encouraged to elect one Â¿physical activityÂ¿ in which they will not be formally assessed with a view to developing a deeper understanding of this activity and effective pedagogical practice in this area.  By the end of PDL(2) each student Â¿ teacher would submit a detailed teaching resource based on this engagement.</td>
