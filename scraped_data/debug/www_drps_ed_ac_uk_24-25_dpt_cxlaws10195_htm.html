<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">This course is aimed at giving students a working knowledge of the framework and dynamics of international civil and commercial litigation. The course will consider many of the issues that will need to be addressed by companies and individuals when faced with litigation involving cross-border elements. The approach to the regulation of cross-border disputes varies in different jurisdictions and the questions of which court has jurisdiction to hear a case and which law will be applied to the determination of that case depend to a large extent on which set of rules results applicable to the case. This course will consider international, regional and national approaches in relation to questions of jurisdiction, applicable law and international judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters. It will provide an opportunity to visualise how some key aspects of international litigation work in practice in some of the most popular judicial systems with vast expertise in international civil and commercial litigation, such as England. Hence, this course is not limited to the study of international civil and commercial litigation in the Scottish courts but provides a window into the practice of international litigation in popular hubs for international legal practice.</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    The course aims to develop the studentsÂ¿ knowledge and understanding of the legal instruments applicable to the determination of civil and commercial jurisdiction, applicable law in contract and delict, the nuances of multi-party disputes in the international civil and commercial context, and the ingenuity of international legal practice in different jurisdictions to manage the challenges posed by legal diversity in this context.

<br />
Participants in the course will be able to study the following core topics:<br />
<br />
1.	The Dynamics of Cross-Border Litigation<br />
1.1.	Litigation in the wider context of dispute resolution mechanisms<br />
1.2.	Primary issues informing the process of resolving cross-border disputes<br />
1.3.	Procedural justice and procedural efficiency <br />
<br />
2.	Jurisdiction in Civil and Commercial Litigation<br />

       6.1. Special scenarios: e.g. cargo claims, product liability    claims<br />
       6.2. Special procedural mechanisms: e.g. counter-claims, joinder and consolidation<br />
       6.3. Special problems with overlapping and/or inconsistent choice of law and choice of court agreements<br />
<br />
7.	Procedural Devices<br />
7.1.	Provisional and protective measures<br />
7.2.	Freezing assets<br />
7.3.	Enforceability of provisional measures in the EU <br />
<br />
8.	International Judicial Co-operation<br />
8.1.	Service of process<br />
8.2.	Obtaining evidence abroad<br />
8.3.	Recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments<br />
<br />
The course will be taught by a series of seminars covering these topics in depth and with detailed analysis of leading cases mainly in Scots and English law, but also including well-known leading cases in other jurisdictions: e.g. jurisdictions in the United States and other European legal systems. The students will be required to undertake reading in advance of the seminars and at times apply the legal rules to previously given problem scenarios.  Students will also be expected to give short presentations on specific issues in a number of seminars. By the end of the course students should be able to demonstrate an understanding of the basics of international civil and commercial litigation including jurisdiction and applicable law rules regarding contracts and delict in the EU; a good knowledge of legal doctrines and devices crafted to suit the needs of international litigation, covering procedural aspects; and the ability to understand the practice of international litigation in the wider context of international commercial dispute resolution mechanisms available to private parties within the civil and commercial context.<br />

<td class="rowhead1" width="15%">Pre-requisites</td><td width="85%" colspan="4">This course is only open to visiting students coming through a direct exchange with the School of Law (including Erasmus students on a Law-specific Exchange). Exchange students outside of Law and independent study abroad students are not eligible to enrol in this course, with no exceptions.<br />
<br />
**Please note that 3rd year Law courses are high-demand, meaning that they have a very high number of students wishing to enrol in a very limited number of spaces.**  <br />
Priority will be given to students studying on exchange within the Law department, and it is highly unlikely that there will be additional spaces for general exchange students &amp; independent study abroad students to enrol; we will look into this on a case-by-case basis in September/January. Visiting students are advised to bear in mind that enrolment in specific courses can never be guaranteed, and you may need to be flexible in finding alternatives in case your preferred courses have no available space. <br />
<br />
These enrolments are managed strictly by the Visiting Student Office, in line with the quotas allocated by the department, and all enquiries to enrol in these courses must be made through the CAHSS Visiting Student Office. It is not appropriate for students to contact the department directly to request additional spaces.<br />
