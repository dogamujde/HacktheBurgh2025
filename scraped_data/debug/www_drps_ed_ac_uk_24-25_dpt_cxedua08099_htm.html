In addition, this course introduces the students to the ways in which development in childhood and adolescence can be researched, the relationship between developmental research and educational practice, and the ethical issues relating to the participation of children and adolescents in developmental research. There is also an emphasis on gaining understanding and experience of quantitative approaches. The course draws predominantly on the disciplines of developmental psychology and psychomotor development, along with introductory material on neuroscience in education, placing these in an educational context.<br />
<br />
The course includes observations tasks to enable students to contextualise and reflect on their learning, as well as to carry out research tasks.</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    Academic description/outline content:<br />
The course consists of two strands which run concurrently, to support students in understanding the links between developmental research/theory and research methods.<br />
<br />
1. Understanding Development in Childhood and Adolescence<br />
This begins with an overview of how childhood and adolescence are conceptualised within a wide range of disciplines, including developmental psychology and the sociology of childhood. It then goes on to focus on developmental psychology and psychomotor development. Students are encouraged to critically consider the ecological context of development in childhood and adolescence, from micro to macro level influences, a theme that is revisited through the course. The bulk of this strand consists of a critical examination of theories and research on typical and atypical cognitive, social, emotional and psycho-motor development in childhood and adolescence. Students are encouraged to view development holistically, and to consider the connections between different aspects of development. The research covered includes classic studies as well as more recent research that builds on this earlier work. There is also an introduction to the discipline of neuroscience in education, with discussion of the development of the brain, and the relationship between brain development and learning. This includes some coverage of neuromyths in Education (linking to the idea of the teacher as a reflective/critical practitioner). Throughout the course students are asked to consider the bidirectional links between development and education. They are encouraged to critically reflect on the extent to which knowledge of development can enhance educators' practice in engaging children/adolescents in learning and supporting social development. In particular, links between child/adolescent development and 'Health and Well-being' within the Curriculum for Excellence will be highlighted, as will the relationship between development and behaviour.<br />
<br />
2. Researching Development in Childhood and Adolescence<br />
In this strand, students are initially introduced to the broad range of qualitative and quantitative research methods used within developmental psychology. There is then an introduction to experimental and quasi-experimental research design, with students encouraged to consider and critique the experimental methods discussed within the first strand of the course. From within the broad range of research methods, students then be introduced to quantitative observational approaches in more detail. They will be supported to use this method to conduct a piece of small-scale research into one aspect of development (this research may take place within an educational context or using existing data sets). Students are then supported to develop their understanding of and ability to work with quantitative data, using descriptive statistics to describe elementary data, including their own observational data. A key component throughout this strand is the ethics around research involving children and adolescents, including issues of informed consent and power dynamics in research. Throughout this strand students are also encouraged to reflect on the relationship between developmental research and educational practice.<br />
<br />
Student learning experience:<br />
Weekly lectures and workshops. During the course students will be asked to engage with a variety of learning experiences, including: lecture content, discussion of video clips, small and whole group workshop discussions, small group tasks, and computer-based learning (e.g. literature searching, quantitative data analysis).<br />
<br />
Outwith classes, students will be asked to undertake and reflect on reading prior to each lecture or workshop. Additional preparation (e.g. work on small group tasks) will also be required before workshops. Work on formative and summative assessment tasks will be required outwith class.<br />
<br />
Students will be encouraged to use resources provided in class, as well as external resources (e.g. Institute for Academic Development) to develop the academic literacy and numeracy skills required for the workshops and assessments.
