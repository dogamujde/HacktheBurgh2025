<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">The course forms part of the Student-Led Individually Created Course (SLICC) university-wide framework for self-designed experiential learning.  It offers a highly flexible yet supported approach where students develop their own defined experience or series of related activities and experiences with a theme, to address their own specific academic and professional demands.  Students reflect regularly and throughout their chosen experience, specifically by reflective blogging, which they collect and curate as a reflective e-portfolio to provide evidence of their learning.  As a participating student, undertaking a SLICC will enable you to create a learning experience which is unique to you and your own needs and academia and professional aims.  You will demonstrate your learning and academic achievement against defined learning outcomes in a defined experiential learning and assessment framework.<br />
<br />
This level 11 course will require you to demonstrate the development of your skills and understanding in terms of critical analysis, application, self-reflection, recognising and developing your skills and mindsets, and evaluation within a context of the learning experience you have defined.  This course will also enable you to demonstrate your ability to exercise autonomy and initiative, and deal with challenges that may present themselves in an academic subject/discipline (or other approved) area and/or at an applied professional level in practice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    A SLICC requires you to propose, develop and manage your own learning experience within a supported learning and assessment framework that will enable you to evidence how you have achieved the learning outcomes of the course.  It offers you autonomy and flexibility to address your work learning requirements, and academic professional needs.<br />
<br />
Your self-designed learning experience is required to adhere to a defined learning and assessment framework that supports and enables you to self-direct and manage your own learning experience.  Within this structure however, you have real autonomy and flexibility regarding the topic or theme, content of study and nature of your experience, provided your proposal is academically feasible and is approved by your tutor.<br />
<br />
Your SLICC may, for example, be based upon a particular extra-curricular learning opportunity such as an internship, work experience, pro-bono activity, community engagement, volunteering, study-abroad or indeed may be entirely self-directed.  In agreement with your own programme, your SLICC could also be based on your wider co-curricular range of activities in which you engage to support your main course of study and how these contribute to your wider development.  These may include your learning and its usage and application, from what would otherwise be co- or extra-curricular activities.  It may focus on a theme of personal and/or professional interest such as sustainability, external engagement, equality and cultural diversity, or a disciplinary or interdisciplinary-based research theme or application.<br />
<br />
The steps in undertaking a SLICC are as follows:<br />
1) Identify a suitable opportunity within in which to undertake your learning experience<br />
2) Write your draft proposal and submit to your tutor/mentor for approval<br />
3) Self-direct and manage your own learning experience as detailed within the framework<br />
4) Actively and regularly reflect upon and document your experience with evidence and use that as a basis for writing your self-critical 'Interim Reflective Report', then your 'Final Reflective Report'<br />
5) Formatively self-assess and submit your 'Final Reflective Report' for summative assessment by your tutor<br />
<br />
The steps identified above each require a significant amount of thought and input and will ultimately form part of a 'time-based' e-portfolio of reflective evidence which you will curate and use in the assessment of your SLICC.<br />
<br />
Undertaking a SLICC you will not only develop the content of your learning experience but also produce an agreed portfolio of outputs.  You must evidence what you have learned and, importantly, where you demonstrate how you met the learning outcomes for the course.

<td class="rowhead1" stlye="width:15%;">Additional Information (Assessment)</td>
<td colspan="14">A SLICC is assessed via three key components, a self-reflective report, an agreed portfolio of outputs and a formative self-assessment.<br />
<br />
Self-critical 'Final Reflective Report' (100% weighting) - The reflective report is the key component of your assessment.  You are expected to document and demonstrate active self-critical reflection and responses to your learning throughout your experience.  It is essential that your report is linked to and draws upon your e-portfolio of evidence of your learning.  Maximum word limit is 3000 words.<br />
<br />
E-portfolio of evidence - At the proposal approval stage for your SLICC, your tutor/advisor will discuss and agree with you what outputs and information needs to be created, collated and submitted in your portfolio.  This e-portfolio will support and provide evidence for your learning and development of skills throughout your SLICC.  Your portfolio should be constructed throughout the duration of your learning experience, demonstrating evolution, iteration and progress over-time.  It must include a regular reflective blog diary.  It may contain other evidence, which may take many forms including photographs, documents, reports, feedback, video, podcasts, etc.<br />
<br />
Formative Self-Assessment - An important component of your final submission, in addition to your ability to self-critically reflect on your experience, is to demonstrate your understanding of your achievements through graded self-assessment.  In your self-assessment you are required to demonstrate the alignment of the grades given by you for each learning outcome to the justification for them, and where this is evidenced within your portfolio.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" stlye="width:15%;">Feedback</td>
<td colspan="14">You will be given detailed formative feedback at: (a) the stage of reflecting on what you wish to do and achieve during your project, whilst defining your own learning outcomes in your 'Proposal' - setting these effectively at the start is a key element to the SLICC; (b) on your 'Interim Reflective Report'.  This permits you to reflect and act on this feedback before submission of the 'Final Reflective Report', but will also be at a time to gain deep insight into and beneficially influence the progress of your project.  The 'Interim Reflective Report' is in the same format as the 'Final Reflective Report', so formative feedback aligns directly with the final summative assessment.<br />
<br />
You will receive summative feedback on your 'Final Reflective Report'.</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width="15%">Graduate Attributes and Skills</td>
<td width="85%">Undertaking a SLICC will enable each student to develop their abilities in self-critical reflection, organisation and time-management, self-assessment, evaluation of standards and competencies achieved, application of prior learning in a defined context, and provide opportunities to further develop analytical and presentation skills.  The SLICC learning outcomes are derived from and embedded in the institutional 'Graduate Attributes' (https://graduate-attributes.ed.ac.uk/).  The learning outcomes are flexible to provide students with autonomy.  With guidance from your assigned academic tutor, this flexibility of choice enables you, in the context of your own chosen experience, to focus on your own particular 'skills' (Learning Outcome 3) and 'mindsets' (Learning Outcome 4).  You can select the specific attributes that you consider are the most important to reflect upon, looking into your current and future professional and personal aims and career aspirations.</td>
