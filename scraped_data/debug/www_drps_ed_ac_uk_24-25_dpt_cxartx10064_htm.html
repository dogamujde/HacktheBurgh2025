It will empower you to organise and share your own practices of artistic learning with your peers and in public art institutions. It will enable you to engage with and practice art-as-education / education-as-art in an open and accessible way.  You will learn how to build trust and support communities of practice that extend beyond the art school.</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    This School of Art course will enable you to make your own contribution to opening access to and widening participation in artistic learning; it will inspire your to support your peers by codifying and sharing your practice. <br />
<br />
Art education today is porous and ubiquitous: it exists in a wide variety of formal and informal arts contexts and in can be found in many different cultures and societies. It takes many diverse organisational forms, traversing virtual communities, small artist-led initiatives, international biennials, art academies and artistic practices.<br />
<br />
The course combines and practises a range of peer-based learning theories and theories of knowledge production. You will consider how to extend online open access into the types of 'Third Places' (Soja, 1996) frequently produced by artists (galleries, schools, studios, workshops, public sites....) by learning how to practise paragogics, a set of learning principles that offer a flexible framework for peer learning and knowledge production. The course is heavily scaffolded to begin. It slowly removes this scaffold to enable peer-support for each other's learning, then, finally, requires you to lead teaching and feedback.<br />
<br />
The course is split into three parts:<br />
<br />
Part I: The Art of the Art Assignment<br />
<br />
The first series of workshops introduce you to D-I-T (do-it-together) and P2P (peer-to-peer) methods of artistic practice through responding to weekly art assignments. The assignments are short and simple to engage with. Your work for them forms the basis of critical discussion (critiques) each week on art-as-education and education-as-art. These critiques will take place in your small peer-support group, within which you will remain for the duration of the course.<br />
<br />
The rationale and context of each assignment is supported by a OER (open educational resource). The OER includes flipped lectures recorded in advance of the workshops which can be viewed online and supporting materials which scaffold your practice and your role as a supportive peer in crits. The OER is also a public site to which you will upload your work for each assignment. The OER enables the workshop time to focus on reviewing and setting live art assignments.<br />
<br />
At the end of Part I: you will have been given formative feedback by, and given formative feedback on, the contributions of each member of your small peer-support group.<br />
<br />
Part II: Players: Public Workshop<br />
<br />
Work Part II centres around a workshop led by the School of Art's Art &amp; Learning Research Group (www.eca.ed.ac.uk/research/art-learning). This will normally be run in collaboration with partner art institution so that it can be open to invited artists and the wider public.<br />
<br />
The workshop is metacognitive: taking part in it will teach you how to devise and run your own workshops. You will witness and experience what does, and does not, work in different learning environments and gain a sense of how different learners respond to artistic and educational stimuli.<br />
<br />
Part III: Contemporary Art &amp; Open Learning Event<br />
<br />
The final part of the course supports you to run your own workshop as part of an art and learning event held in public towards the end of this course. <br />
<br />
Your peer-group and tutor will support you to develop your personal project and will, additionally, form part of your audience during the event. Your peers will also take part in reviewing and formatively feeding back on your contribution to this event.<br />
<br />
Equally, you will support your peer-group to develop their personal projects and will, additionally, form their audience. You will also take part in reviewing and formatively feeding back on their contribution to the course's closing event.

<td colspan="14">There are three components of assessment:<br />
1 - Course Participation* <br />
2 - Portfolio of educational research and curriculum design<br />
3 - Written critical reflection on the portfolio<br />
<br />
Learning outcomes are equally weighted for the purposes of grading this course. Each learning outcome will receive a grade from which the course grade will be derived.<br />
<br />
Learning outcome 1 relates both to the assignments you complete AND the critiques you participate in during Part I and Part III of the course. You will evidence this outcome in two interconnected ways: <br />
a) by making creative responses to the artistic assignments set in Part I and Part III of the course that stimulate peer discussion and engagement<br />
b) via the constructive feedback you give to your peer group during the course workshops and via the course VLE at the end of Part I and Part III. <br />
<br />
These two interconnected elements will inform the summative feedback and grade you will receive from your tutor for learning outcome 1. <br />
<br />
Learning outcome 2 is evidenced in your Portfolio of educational research and curriculum design. You will produce a Portfolio that professionally presents your research and your teaching practice for the course's cumulative Contemporary Art &amp; Open Learning event. A digital template will be provided to scaffold the design of your folio. The Portfolio is submitted at the very end of the course. This component is summatively assessed and graded by your tutor.<br />
<br />
Learning outcome 3 is evidenced in your written critical reflection on the portfolio, situating it in an appropriate contemporary artistic and educational context. A digital template will be provided to scaffold your critical reflection. Your written critical reflection forms part of the Portfolio submitted at the very end of the course. This component is summatively assessed and graded by your tutor.<br />
<br />
* students who fail to participate in the course will be given a resit opportunity to retrieve LO1 that will enable them to respond to the artistic assignment(s) they missed and provide constructive feedback that supports peer learning</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" stlye="width:15%;">Feedback</td>
<td colspan="14">You will receive verbal formative feedback from your tutors and peers every time the cohort meets ('workshops'), written formative feedback from peers mid-semester/Part I and end-of-semester/Part III via the VLE. <br />
<br />
Summative written feedback on each Learning Outcome with cooresponding grades will be given by your tutor only once the course has completed.<br />
<br />
Please note that peer-led formative feedback is a key component of this course's curriculum design. The course requires (and assesses) full-participation in workshops. Each session takes the form of a workshop that enables you to collectively reflect upon and develop the work you have produced over the previous week (learning-to-learn).</td>
