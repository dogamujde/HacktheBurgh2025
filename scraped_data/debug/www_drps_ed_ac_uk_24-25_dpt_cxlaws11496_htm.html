<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">Since the Cold War, the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) has witnessed a series of intrastate wars that are among the most prolonged conflicts in the world. As of 2021, there were nine states with active armed conflicts in the region. The failure of conflict resolution and the transition process in the region calls for new and critical approaches. This course provides students with theoretical and practical skills and contextualised knowledge of the EMR relating to transversal issues that interact with conflict and peaceful transition. Students will benefit from a deep and comprehensive vision of the region which will enhance their capacity to offer contextualised and integrative solutions to problematic situations introduced as real-life case studies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    The course is composed of ten main lessons (excluding the reading week).<br />
<br />
Week 1. Towards the creation of a new knowledge<br />
The lesson provides an overview of the objectives, outcomes, and evaluation for the course. It aims to include studentsÂ¿ expectations and needs into the development and implementation of the course, notably on the choice of case studies. The lecture introduces key terms and concepts (why the Â¿Eastern Mediterranean RegionÂ¿ and not the Middle East and North Africa) linked to a discussion around the need for a more inclusive and contextualised knowledge. Students will also be introduced to self-reflective exercises on positionality and privileges. <br />
<br />
Week 2. Geopolitics of conflict and peace in the EMR I<br />
The lesson maps the evolution of conflicts in the EMR region (i.e., in terms of localization, urbanisation, length) and unpacks the complexity of modern conflicts in relation to existing legal norms and systems. This lesson focuses on the post-Arab Uprisings period to include the fragmentation of the global, regional and national orders, as well as the rise of non-state actors and challenges to the legitimacy of the State political and legal system (including violent extremism). <br />
<br />
Week 3. Geopolitics of conflict and peace in the EMR II<br />
Building on Lesson 2, the lesson outlines more of the main dynamics that can be observed in modern armed conflicts in the EMR. It maps internal and external influences (i.e., the role of emergent powers and illiberal actors) in conflicts and peace, and the impact of international interventions in the region on the legitimacy of the state as the political unit of reference. <br />
<br />
Week 4. Local conflict dynamics and peacemaking<br />
After outlining the complexity of the Â¿smallÂ¿ peace - Â¿bigÂ¿ peace relation and the concept of hybridity, the lesson introduces students to the importance of local peace processes as legal tools for conflict resolution. Students will be given the opportunity to explore the largest dataset of peace agreements, developed by PeaceRep and hosted at the University of Edinburgh. Based on this exploration, they will be invited to reflect on the impact of new conflict dynamics on conflict management, especially in terms of actors and methods. <br />
<br />
Week 5. Reconsider the conflict-peace continuum  <br />
The lesson leads students to reassess and discuss a number of assumptions on armed conflicts and peace in the EMR, such as the fact that conflicts necessarily happen in weak states and the positive framing of peace. Do help this thinking, the lesson introduces concepts such as negative peace, formalised unsettlement and informal settlements. It also touches on the intersection between the expediency of national talks and the political agenda of national stakeholders, and the disruption of progress for local mediators. <br />
<br />
Week 6. State-society relations<br />
The lesson outlines the impact of key dynamics of modern conflicts and peace (discussed during previous lessons) on state-society relations and the way we think of the state in the EMR. Students will discover and discuss concepts of legitimacy, resistance and agency, as well as the consequences of the lack of regional leadership in the EMR. It also examines power-sharing arrangements, and in particular consociationalism, as a response to ethno-national conflicts.<br />
<br />
Week 7. Humanitarian and human rights law<br />
The lesson lays out general knowledge of the international humanitarian and human rights standards relating to a number of key issues in conflict and post-conflict settings. It also introduces challenges of legal transfers and adaptation of international legal tools and norms in the cultural and socio-political contexts of the EMR, leading to a discussion of the universality of certain legal rights and norms.<br />
<br />
Week 8. The health, conflict and peace nexus <br />
After introducing the flaws of the existing legal framework, the lesson looks at the interactions (direct, indirect and inter-generational) between health issues and conflicts dynamics, with a focus on natural resources and environmental challenges. It also provides an overview of the opportunities to harness the peace dividends of health and of the partners of health and peaceful transition in the EMR.<br />
<br />
Week 9. The challenges of inclusive peace in extreme diversity contexts<br />
Building on previous weeks, the lesson zooms on the role of social leaders Â¿ notably religious and tribal leaders Â¿ in fuelling violence and prompting peace, including their interactions with governance stakeholders. The lesson also includes insights on the inclusion of women and civil society in conflict resolution mechanisms and opportunities to make peace more inclusive. Finally, students will be invited to reflect on the prioritisation of immediate (and imperfect) peace over comprehensive, more sustainable political settlements.<br />
 <br />
Week 10. Women, girls and gender in peace and conflict<br />
After introducing the gendered dynamics of conflict, and peace, the lesson questions the depiction of women as mere victims of conflicts, and gendered mobilization for peace and wider political participation. The discussion also considers contestation of masculinities in an overwhelmingly patriarchal socio-cultural EMR environments. Students will be invited to reconsider Western approaches to peace that attempt to enforce liberal understanding of womenÂ¿s role and positions, including the problematic nature of implementation of ideals involving security element so often run/provided by men.
