<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    1) Academic Description <br />
<br />
This course is offered as part of the Access Programme (Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences). The Access Programme aims to prepare students for undergraduate study by introducing them to a range of essential skills and encouraging them to employ these<br />
skills in a confident and flexible way.<br />
<br />
Semester 1 courses are designed to foster those skills which are broadly transferable within their respective disciplinary areas and are designed to prepare students for progression to semester 2. <br />
<br />
This, semester 1 course will provide an inclusive, supportive, stimulating and creative environment in which students are supported to create strong portfolios suitable for entry to the wide variety of art and design degree programmes (for example, Art, Intermedia Art, Painting, Photography, Sculpture, Fine Art, Animation, Fashion, Film &amp; Television, Graphic Design, Illustration, Interior Design, Jewellery &amp; Silversmithing, Performance Costume, Product Design, Textiles, etc.).<br />
<br />
The core focus of Access Art and Design 1 is in skills development and portfolio preparation, supporting each student to demonstrate their artistic ability and potential in relation to their chosen degree pathways. Students will be encouraged to identify their potential degree pathways at an early stage of the course so that their learning can be tailored effectively towards individual outcomes and tailored portfolios. In line with a student's application to ECA and the 'portfolio assessment criteria' (which can also be used to map on to other institutions submission applications) four key areas will be blended into the learning journey: enquiry and visual research; idea development and material/technical exploration; critical judgement, reflection and resolution; and contextual awareness.<br />
<br />
The course will include core skills-development workshops in a range of drawing and 2d/3d skills and techniques, visual recording, mixed-media experimentation and confidence building, digital engagement, and portfolio presentation along with enrichment activities to support progression. Work will be focussed around a themed project/ live brief which is designed to enable students to engage with, and demonstrate independent creative exploration and underpin their creative output and skills development. <br />
<br />
2) Course Content<br />
<br />
The course is designed around portfolio requirements for entry to degree courses in art and design.<br />
<br />
Each of the twelve practical studio sessions includes tutor input on a range of issues and approaches within contemporary art and design.  These sessions are designed to stimulate the students' work and provide greater depth to their portfolios. <br />
<br />
Evidence of drawing enquiry and visual research is a core requirement of all art and design degrees, so both primary observational and experimental 2d and 3d drawing forms the first half of Art and Design 1, through observation and photography in journals, sketchbooks and developing mixed-media work, along with emotive exploration. Students will be directed towards specific degree course preparation and additional digital training if this is required for progression. Thereafter the course is project-based, encouraging students to develop interest in ideas and engage with themes relating to their practical work, undertaking independent research and practice-led enquiry.<br />
<br />
The class project/live brief provides a broad theme around which students can structure work for their application portfolio, supported through individual and group tutorials and critiques. Students will be encouraged to become reflective thinkers and engage with digital learning, though the expansion of creative ideas between classes and weekly submission of individual digital portfolios. <br />
<br />
3) Student Learning Experience <br />
<br />
Students will typically learn through weekly studio-based and site- specific practical enquiry in a creative and supportive environment.  Learning will be supported by short seminars of contemporary art/ design and cultural issues, in order to strengthen theoretical engagement with their practice. The seminars will take place weekly before each practical session. Whilst the course is structured towards the broad needs for all programmes of continued study, students will be encouraged to be reflective learners, and to work towards their chosen pathways through independent research, and journal and portfolio development. <br />
<br />
Students will submit five formative pieces of work linked to the learning outcomes for the course, in the form of physical and digital portfolios, along with one short presentation on their planned project work.<br />
<br />
Constructive feedback (both verbal and written) will be provided by the course tutor. Students will be encouraged to consider feedback and to respond to this in future work. <br />
<br />
No grades will be provided for individual pieces of work, but an overall indicative course grade will be given at the end of semester based upon participation, coursework and response to feedback.<br />
<br />
In addition to support and feedback at course level, all students on the Access Programme will engage via an online learning journal, where they will be prompted to reflect on their learning experience, feedback and progress and will receive personalised guidance and support from their Personal Tutor. <br />
<br />
Students will also participate in a range of cultural and social engagement activities which are intended to complement their studies, increase cultural capital, encourage engagement with peers and communities, and build a sense of belonging.<br />

<td colspan="14">Five formative assignments linked to the learning outcomes for the course and focussed on developing student's visual research skills and supporting and steering portfolios for entry to degree courses.  These formative assignments will take the forms described below. Each feeds into an overall indicative grade which will be given at the end of the course.<br />
Formative assessment 1: Introducing the purpose of the sketchbook and ways of using it effectively to gather visual research - comprising visual information gathering and experimental drawing (week 3) (LO.1)<br />
This submission should consist of around 10 pages of sketchbook work which demonstrate selected approaches to experimental drawing and collage which have been discussed in class, and a range of visual research which begins to demonstrate the student's visual interests. The submission will be viewed in person in the studio [or via a digital submission]<br />
Formative assessment 2: Research, context and ideas - comprising visual information gathering, sketchbook and idea generation. (LO.1)<br />
This submission should consist of around a further 15 pages of sketchbook work which demonstrate a range of visual research which demonstrate the student's visual interests and which draws upon a -range of appropriate approaches to image-making, including collage, experimental drawing, mixed media approaches. The submission will be viewed in person in the studio [or via a digital submission]<br />
Formative assessment 3: Practice, skills and techniques - visual presentations to the student group, demonstrating practical work in progress and proposed direction for resolved work. (week 7) (LO.1; LO.2) The submission will be presented live to the class group [or in an on-line presentation].<br />
This submission should consist of a short digital presentation of around 5 slides in which the student illustrates their intended project starting points, research strategies and material experiments, and contextual and artist influences.<br />
Formative assessment 4 and 5:  Selection, presentation and reflection - preparation of a first and second draft of a digital mini-portfolio for student's selected degree courses. (LO.3)<br />
These submissions should consist of digital submissions of intended portfolio content divided into research and development material, resolved work and context/influences. These submissions will be uploaded digitally to Learn for assessment.<br />
No grades will be provided for individual pieces of work but an overall indicative course grade will be given based upon coursework and response to feedback.<br />
Students will be deemed to have passed the course with an indicative grade awarded (grade D or above) if they satisfy the Formative Assessment elements, in line with the course Learning Outcomes based on the ECA marking scheme.</td>
