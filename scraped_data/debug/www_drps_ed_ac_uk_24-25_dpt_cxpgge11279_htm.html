<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">All geoengineering activities involving utilisation of subsurface resources, such as geothermal energy, carbon capture and storage and energy storage will cause changes in the subsurface hydrogeology. Hydrogeologists must assess the impact of these changes and take steps to minimise their impact. This course will cover current water legislation and regulations along with the environment impact assessment and risk assessments, which are the framework within which all hydrogeological and geoengineering activities must take place. The course will introduce regional groundwater flow modelling within a variety of different geoengineering scenarios; to refine skills in conceptualising groundwater systems from limited data; and to introduce professional groundwater modelling software use computers to model groundwater flow, chemistry and temperature according to geological formations, surface water flow and man-made influence.<br />
<br />
The course lectures, which develop the students knowledge base with advancing concepts that, are supported by practical numerical modelling and report writing. This is aimed at developing technical, interpretation and reporting skills and encourage critical thinking. Integration of the concepts developed in the taught programme is facilitated through student centred investigations of current issues linked to a range of geoengineering applications.<br />

<br />
WK3<br />
<br />
Session 1: Modelling Topic: Importance of benchmarks // Using Theis <br />

<br />
WK4<br />
Session 1: Model Topic: Contaminant transport model, using OGS<br />
Saltwater ingress due to over pumping at the coast, part 1. <br />
A coastal aquifer system will be modelled, requiring a conceptual hydrogeological model with both groundwater flow and mass (contaminant) saltwater transport to be developed and parameterised. Students will have to consider appropriate parameterisation (turning geology into numbers), uncertainties and controls. The application of the tutorial is to balance possible water use and prevent long term saltwater ingress by managing the location of possible wells and pumping rates.<br />
<br />
Session 2: Water Equality and social licence to operate <br />
We will hold formal class debates around resolutions pertinent to the topic of water equality:<br />
- Should water be supplied for free?<br />
- Are charities such as Water Aid the best vehicles to ensure equal access to water across the globe?<br />
- Should building of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Nile be allowed to continue?<br />
- Should fracking for shale gas be supported?<br />
- Should people who live on flood plains pay more for their house insurance?<br />
- Should our environment and biosphere have an equal right to water as the local population in areas of water scarcity?<br />
- Does water storage in reservoirs reduce water scarcity?<br />
- Is desalination that answer to providing potable water?<br />
<br />
WK5<br />
<br />
Session 1: Modelling topic Contaminant transport part 2, consolidation of learning and reporting. <br />
Contaminant transport model: Saltwater ingress due to overpumping at the coast, part 2.<br />
Students are to determine the main controls on the saltwater intrusion, and identify key sensitivities. The workshop is free for students to explore the parameter space and the model responses, in preparation of the modelling report due at the end of the week.<br />
