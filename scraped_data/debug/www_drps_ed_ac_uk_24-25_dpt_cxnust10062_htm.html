<br />
This course provides students with the opportunity to develop their proficiency in nursing practice through engagement in the practice learning environment and reflection on practice. The course draws on the theoretical knowledge developed across the other courses within the Master of Nursing with Pre-registration (Adult), and enables students to understand how individuals' life contexts, health beliefs and health literacy intersect with their physical, psychological and emotional selves in relation to health, illness and disease, producing particular health and social care needs within the context of nursing practice.</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    This course provides students with the opportunity to develop their proficiency in nursing practice through engagement in the practice learning environment, simulated clinical skills teaching environment and reflection on practice. The aim of the course is to enable students to develop person-centred, holistic, and evidence based nursing practice in a range of different care settings. Students will work with supervisors in practice to apply the skills and knowledge that they are developing across the programme in the practice setting and develop their competence in relation to achievement of the NMC Proficiencies for Practice. <br />
<br />
The course draws on the theoretical knowledge developed across the other courses within the programme, and enables students to understand how individuals' life contexts, health beliefs and health literacy intersect with their physical, psychological and emotional selves in relation to health, illness and disease producing particular health and social care needs within the context of nursing practice. <br />
<br />
Students will develop nursing practice related to working with people across the life stages in home, community and hospital settings. They will learn:<br />
<br />
Nursing skills are developed through teaching and learning in both the practice setting and in the simulated environment including;<br />
- communication and interpersonal skills <br />
- interprofessional team working simulated learning <br />
- clinical skills  <br />
<br />
Through facilitated critical reflection on practice, students gain an understanding of: <br />
- organizational and service related issues on the workforce <br />
- professional responsibilities and accountability<br />
- patients and their families in the social and health care setting<br />
- multidisciplinary teams and team working<br />
- the use of evidence in nursing practice<br />
- critical reflection as a key learning and development strategy<br />
<br />
Students will work in the placement learning setting for part of the week across semesters 1 and 2 with some blocks of placement learning during this time. They will then undertake a long block of full time placement learning over the summer months to complete the required number of practice hours. Placements will be in a variety of settings and will provide students with the opportunity to experience practice with nurses, physicians and Allied Health Professionals. Students will be expected to work as supernumerary members of the multi-disciplinary team within the placement learning environment.  The final placement in this year provides the opportunity for students to experience healthcare in an international context, or a UK context outwith the standard provision for students within NHS Lothian and NHS Borders.<br />
<br />
Within the placement learning environment, students are supported by Practice Supervisors who are members of staff within the placement environment who have been suitably prepared to meet NMC requirements for the role.<br />
<br />
Fortnightly facilitated group reflective practice sessions will run in semester 1 and 2 to facilitate student learning through critical reflection on practice, bringing together their academic knowledge to understand their experiences and critically engage with their practice. These sessions will be structured and take a specific focus across the curriculum to encourage students to critically reflect on all aspects of nursing and healthcare. Students are required to keep a critical reflective account of their learning through these reflective practice sessions to support their learning. <br />
<br />
Students will engage in clinical skills development within the simulated environment including interprofessional simulation with medical students.   There will also be opportunities for Peer Assisted Learning (PAL) which again may be interdisciplinary and/or across programmes within Nursing.
