By the end of the Course students should be able to assist a doctor in providing clinical care. <br />
 <br />
The year is organised into three semesters with each divided into two 5 week blocks with Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) assessments at the end of each followed by vacation. <br />
 <br />
Students build on the knowledge and skills of earlier Courses and increasingly engage in everyday clinical practice within the limits of their competence and under careful supervision. Teaching and learning methods remain varied as in Year 4 with the addition of further modes. <br />
 <br />
For SSC5 Teaching, students work in small groups to contribute to peer assisted learning. This might be teaching on an established project such as the practice OSCE for students in earlier years or developing something new. <br />
 <br />
There are opportunities for formative feedback throughout the Course. <br />
 <br />
Assessments occur at the end of each semester in the form of a clinical exam, usually an OSCE, and at the end of the in the form of written exams (MCQ and very short answer questions) and OSCE. Students are expected to demonstrate a professional approach to their studies and conduct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    The modules include Psychiatry, Child Life &amp; Health, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Haematology, Oncology, Palliative Care, Breast Diseases, Urology, Renal, Orthopaedics, Dermatology, Ophthalmology, Otolaryngology (ENT), Student Selected Component 5 Teaching and portfolio components on Doctor as a Safe Practitioner, Communicator, and Educator. <br />
 <br />
The teaching and learning experiences are varied and include interactive lectures, small group tutorials, directed reading using a range of materials including online lectures and computer based learning packages, resuscitation, clinical skills and communication workshops. Students can be based in community, clinics, wards, operating theatres, imaging, and investigative labs. SSC5 Teaching is a group project aimed at developing the learning of others. <br />
 <br />
The curriculum and its teaching and learning methods continue to guide the development of self-directed learning. Less of the required knowledge is provided in face to face or online lectures but there will be clear guidance to prioritise students' reading and these methods are complemented by interactive tutorials, often in the clinical setting. The portfolio case reports summaries direct students to explore in-depth the needs of individual patients, and to reflect on and critique current approaches to management. The clinical skills observations offer students another opportunity to take responsibility for their own learning, and emulates the requirements of postgraduate medical training for new doctors. Students are expected to challenge themselves to be observed in new tasks, capture the feedback and store it in their portfolio to help them recall it and use it to improve their performance. At the end of modules, tutors review the evidence of performance (e.g. clinical observations) with students and provide additional written and verbal comments on general progress, with suggestions for developments. <br />
 <br />
There are many other opportunities for feedback, described below. Students are expected to reflect on this feedback, discuss it with their Undergraduate Supervisor (or Year Director) and use it to further direct and regulate their own learning.

Biomedical Sciences (BMS) apply to a broad range of defined specialties, the biomedical scientific principles, method and knowledge relating to relevant sciences including anatomy, biochemistry, cell biology, genetics, immunology, microbiology, molecular biology, nutrition, pathology and physiology.  2.   Psychological Aspects of Medicine (PAM) recognise and assess important psychological and behavioural aspects of health, illness and disease; and respond appropriately to these aspects, using strategies such as explanation and advice to address them.   3.   Social Sciences and Public Health (SSPH) implement, at a clinical level, knowledge of how to understand the experience of illness and illness behaviour for a broad range of defined specialties; and describe how to prevent disease, prolong life and promote health through the organised efforts of society, analyse a population's health problems, establish the causes and effects of these problems and assist appropriately in implementing effective solutions.   4.   Evidence-Based Medicine and Research (EBM&amp;R) use the best available medical evidence, found through a systematic search and appraisal of the relevant information sources, to inform their clinical thinking for a broad range of defined specialties; and develop new knowledge or personal understanding through the application of basic research methods and skills.</li><li>as a practitioner, undertake initial assessment of patients with presentations relating to a broad range of specialities, propose clinical management, review and ongoing care, and seeking help from colleagues appropriately.  More specifically:</li><li>as a professional, take a reflective and self-directed approach to the study of medicine, demonstrate professional judgment and understanding of the ethical, professional and legal responsibilities expected in clinical practice, participate in a multi-professional team, teach others, and contribute to enhancing patient care whilst paying attention to personal health, wellbeing and professional development.  More specifically:  11.    Medical Ethics, Legal And Professional Responsibilities  (MELPR) demonstrate understanding of how to practise medicine, in a broad range of defined specialties and contexts, within an ethical framework, with insight and compassion, according to the legal requirements and professional expectations of medical practice in the UK.                                                                       12.

<td width="85%">GRADUATE ATTRIBUTES, PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL SKILLS<br />
Throughout the MBChB programme, the curriculum offers challenging opportunities and support to ensure all successful students develop the University graduate attributes of Enquiry and Lifelong Learning, Aspiration and Personal Development, and Outlook and Engagement.  <br />
<br />
More specifically the list below describes how the Course Learning Outcomes address, with some overlap, the 4 sets of skills and abilities that underpin the graduate attributes.  The Course study guides provide further information in the detailed learning outcomes for each module.  <br />
<br />
The successful student completing this Course will be able to demonstrate the following skills and abilities in RESEARCH and ENQUIRY, contributing to the University Graduate Attributes:<br />
<br />
Biomedical Sciences (BMS)<br />
apply to a broad range of defined specialties, the biomedical scientific principles, method and knowledge relating to relevant sciences including anatomy, biochemistry, cell biology, genetics, immunology, microbiology, molecular biology, nutrition, pathology and physiology.<br />
<br />
Psychological Aspects of Medicine  (PAM)<br />
recognise and assess important psychological and behavioural aspects of health, illness and disease; and respond appropriately to these aspects, using strategies such as explanation and advice to address them. <br />
<br />
Social Sciences and Public Health (SSPH)<br />
implement, at a clinical level, knowledge of how to understand the experience of illness and illness behaviour for a broad range of defined specialties; and describe how to prevent disease, prolong life and promote health through the organised efforts of society, analyse a population's health problems, establish the causes and effects of these problems and assist appropriately in implementing effective solutions. <br />
