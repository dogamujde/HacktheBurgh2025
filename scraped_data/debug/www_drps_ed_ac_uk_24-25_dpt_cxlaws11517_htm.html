<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    This course is intended for students who contemplate a career in a variety of fields dealing with conflict-affected environments (i.e., UN agencies, humanitarian and development organisations, research institutions, etc.). Beyond strong theoretical knowledge, working in conflict requires a set of specific practical skills which few young professionals are equipped with. Developed in collaboration with the UN and based on the experience of several senior professionals, this course aims to remedy this gap by providing students with a basic &quot;toolbox&quot; of practical skills and strategies to deal with the challenges of violent environments. The course also speaks to the latest developments in conflict and peacemaking, such as the multiplication of non-state actors and the emergence of new technologies. It is centered around three core themes for effective and positive action: understand, cooperate, and protect. Students will benefit from an honest outlook on the daily challenges and mitigation strategies of working in conflict-ridden areas such as Columbia, Kenya, Syria and Ukraine. By the end of the course, they will be able to walk more confidently into the professional world and meaningfully contribute to the alleviation of the consequences of armed conflicts. While this is a legal course and is particularly well suited to students of humanitarian and human rights law, it will also be open to a small number of students of international development and politics.<br />
<br />
The course is composed of ten main lessons (excluding the reading week).<br />
<br />
Week 1: Leadership and Influencing Skills (Master Class)<br />
After an overview of the objectives, outcomes, and evaluation of the course, students will be introduced to a discussion around privileges, positionality, and self-assessment. This will be followed by a one-hour master class by a UN senior staff (i.e., Assistant Secretary General, Regional Humanitarian Coordinator), on leadership and influencing skills. Geographical focus: Africa and the Middle East*. <br />
 <br />
Week 2: Protection and self-preservation strategies<br />
Based on the Â¿help the helpersÂ¿ approach, this class will provide students with some practical tools of personal development practices and self-awareness, life skills, mental health, and human connection that support the restoration of the nervous system for professionals working in fragile contexts. The class will also include insights from IHL experts at OCHA who work for the protection of vulnerable populations in conflict-ridden areas. Geographical focus: Africa and the Middle East.  <br />
 <br />
Week 3: Problem-solving and creative thinking<br />
This class will challenge students to Â¿think out of the boxÂ¿ to provide innovative solutions to complex problems such as violations of human rights and forced displacement. This includes strategies based on art that focus on grassroots participation and complement traditional approaches to IHL and HRL. This will highlight the crosscutting nature of legal expertise that should infuse any initiative targeted at conflict-affected communities. Geographical focus: Latin America. <br />
 <br />
Week 4: Assessment, monitoring and evaluation<br />
This class will cover the whole process of monitoring, evaluation, and impact assessment, which is of increasing importance to practitioners, donors and grassroots communities. A particular focus will be brought to research and data analysis skills that are critical to studentsÂ¿ academic journey and future professional lives. This class will link to Week 3 by providing students with existing programmes developed around innovative approaches whose values have been harnessed as a powerful force for conflict prevention and peacebuilding. Geographical focus: Global. <br />
 <br />
Week 5: Managing the distance: building bridges with conflict-affected communities (Master Class)<br />
How to protect human rights and improve the humanitarian situation of conflict-affected communities at a distance? This is the question this lesson will attempt to answer. After discussing the challenges of forced immobility and distance, students will be offered a Master Class by a UN senior staff (i.e.,Â¿UNDP Resident, Humanitarian Coordinator). The expert will highlight some practical skills and lessons learned from their experience coordinating humanitarian efforts to reach conflict-ridden areas. Geographical focus: Africa, Latin America, Middle East. <br />
 <br />
Week 6: Adaptation in negotiation: speaking to the good Â¿ and the bad guys (Master Class)<br />
Students will be offered a Master Class by a UN senior political advisor and/or a leading barrister specialising in international law, terrorism and human rights litigation. The expert(s) will build on their experience as international mediators in the wider Middle East to discuss the challenges and strategies of promoting the rule of law in cultural contexts where moral and legal norms are often different than in Europe. Geographical focus: Wider Middle East. <br />
 <br />
Week 7: Research, policymaking, development: do I have to choose? <br />
This class will try to address a critical question for students of law: what is next and how to use the legal knowledge gained at the university? It will highlight the crosscutting and multidisciplinary nature of legal expertise by offering insights from professionals who work between multiple sectors related to conflict resolution and peacemaking. Geographical focus: Africa and the Middle East. <br />
 <br />
Week 8: Fundraising and partnership with donors<br />
This class will shed light on crucial actors, without whom the humanitarian and development cycles would break, funders and donors. Indeed, before they can be part of any intervention, professionals working in conflict-affected areas will first need to secure the financial and political support of key individuals and institutions. This class will equip students with key advocacy and relational skills that will complement the leadership and influencing skills gained in Week 1. Geographical focus: Middle East. <br />
<br />
Week 9: Media in Conflict <br />
This class will investigate the role played by media during conflicts, especially how different kinds of media influence the allocation of humanitarian aid. This class is particularly relevant given the record shortfallÂ¿faced by the UN since 2021 between the funding required and the funding received. This also has key implications for the general publicÂ¿s perception of issues related to HRL and IHR. Students will benefit from insights from journalists covering armed conflicts and will be equipped with additional strategies for effective communication and data analysis. Geographical focus: Middle East and Europe. <br />
 <br />
Week 10: New technologies and peacemaking (Master Class)<br />
Building on PeaceRepÂ¿s leading expertise in Â¿PeaceTechÂ¿, this master class will discuss the potential of new technologies to support legal thinking around issues of prosecution of war crimes, protection of human rights and improvement of the humanitarian situation of those affected by conflicts. It will feature several tools and visualisations created by PeaceRep, such as the PA-X Tracker and the PA-X Peace Agreements databases. Geographical focus: Ukraine.<br />
