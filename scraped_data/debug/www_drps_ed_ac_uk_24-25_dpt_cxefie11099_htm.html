This course will provide you with a critical grounding in social sciences understandings of how narratives function in society, particularly in relation to social transformation and to sustainable orientations and practices. Students will come away from the course with a knowledge of how stories have been used and are being used to connect people to the more-than-human world around them as well as learning the skills to work critically with stories in the community and in their own practices.</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    Story Roots for Sustainable Futures will begin by looking critically at how narratives function in societies. Narratives convey shared values and meanings, which can bring groups and entire societies together. However, there are always alternative or counter-narratives at play as well. We will look at how some stories dominate widely, while others are more local to place and to subcultures and groups. From this grounding, we will look at strategies for working with stories to effect social change and examine case studies where storytelling is used in relation to nature connection and environmental sustainability.<br />
<br />
We will explore storytelling traditions and tales as core to intangible cultural heritage (ICH), enabling traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) to be maintained and shared, and look critically at how to work respectfully with the ICH of other cultures. We will also look at creating new stories, particularly for communicating science in engaging ways.<br />
<br />
The two-day intensive will be run in a workshop format, providing you with hands-on training in crafting and telling stories. We will explore local place and nature connection through story. A guest storyteller will join us for half a day, to share stories and insights about working with ICH, storytelling and TEK. Across the two days, there will be plenty of opportunities to share in small and large group settings. Our intensive will conclude with a live-streamed storytelling Ceilidh, providing you with an opportunity to tell a story to your peers. Learning before and after the intensive will be accessed online through readings, videos and short, independent exercises aimed at connecting you through story to the place where you live. In keeping with the Ceilidh culture, we will also be meeting up online at four 'kitchen table gatherings' for an informal chat about what you are learning during these periods.<br />
<br />
Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:<br />
<br />
The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed. There will, however, be options to control whether or not your video and audio are enabled.<br />
<br />
As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.

<td colspan="14">Summative Assessment:<br />
<br />
The course will be assessed by means of the following assessment components:<br />
<br />
1) 2000 Word Contribution to 'Storytelling for Sustainable Futures Toolkit' (100%)<br />
<br />
The contribution to the public-facing and online toolkit will be a set of instructions, up to 1000 words in length (or equivalent in audio, image or video), on how to do some aspect of storytelling for social change, this could be related to challenging dominant stories, or to excavating alternative stories, or to amplifying alternative stories. It could be a proposal for an event or performance. These contributions should be aimed at an audience of people and communities wanting to work with stories for social transformation in relation to sustainability. This will be introduced and contextualised through a 1000 word essay that engages with the themes introduced in the course and explains how the student drew on these to create their toolkit contribution.<br />
<br />
Formative Assessment:<br />
<br />
Each course within Edinburgh Futures Institute includes the opportunity for you to participate in a formative feedback exercise or event which will help you prepare for your summative assessment. The formative assessment does not contribute to your overall course mark.<br />
<br />
1) Storytelling Performance Skills<br />
<br />
This will be assessed formatively, at a livestreamed storytelling Ceilidh on the afternoon of the second day.<br />
<br />
The story should be 5-10 minutes in length.<br />
<br />
Those who are not able to attend (whether online or in person), will be asked to submit a recorded story within a week of that session.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" stlye="width:15%;">Feedback</td>
<td colspan="14">	Feedback on the formative assessment may be provided in various formats, for example, to include written, oral, video, face-to-face, whole class, or individual. The course organiser will decide which format is most appropriate in relation to the nature of the assessment.<br />
<br />
Feedback on both formative and summative in-course assessed work will be provided in time to be of use in subsequent assessments within the course.<br />
<br />
Feedback on the summative assessment will be provided in written form via Learn, the University of Edinburgh's Virtual Learning Environment (VLE).<br />
<br />
Formative Assessment Feedback:<br />
<br />
- As students can learn as much by critiquing someone else's performance, each student will be asked to give feedback to 3 of their peers and they will receive feedback from myself and 3 of their peers on what 'shone', where people got confused and where people wanted more details from their peers.<br />
<br />
- As it is anticipated that some students may not be able to attend the live Ceilidh, some students will be giving feedback on a mix of live, live-recorded and submitted late stories.<br />
<br />
- Creating and telling a story related to environmental sustainability will give students first-hand experience both as teller and audience, introducing them in an embodied way to the opportunities and challenges in working with stories in this way. This experience will help them to define an opportunity and/or a challenge to work on for their toolkit contribution, which could include this story as part of a proposed event or performance.</td>
