<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">Managing nuclear waste, both that already in existence and in prospect from past nuclear power generation (legacy waste) and waste likely to be produced from future nuclear power programmes, is a major environmental and socioeconomic issue both within the UK and globally. With a number of countries now at various stages of committing to the geological disposal of nuclear waste it is timely to consider the management of nuclear waste in a holistic manner and evaluate the issues that surround geological disposal and other options for waste management, both in the UK and internationally.  <br />
<br />
The course will introduce students to nuclear waste, from its production in the context of nuclear fuel cycle to its treatment, storage and disposal. Whilst firmly based within the UK waste management context, the course will also introduce and review the international legal, regulatory, research and disposal concept environments and frameworks for nuclear waste management.  <br />
<br />
Students will gain a thorough grounding in the national and international context of nuclear waste, from its production to management. They will gain a critical awareness and understanding of the scientific, economic, environmental, social and policy issues surrounding this important subject. They will gain insight into the concept of Safety Cases, and the role of geoscientific knowledge and understanding in developing these. Finally, they will become familiar with the arguments surrounding screening and siting as well as community engagement and volunteerism in developing one or more GDFs in the UK.</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    This course will have three component parts.   <br />
<br />
The first will be the taught component.   <br />
<br />
This will be provided through a series of 5 lecture and discussion sessions presented from Week 4 of the semester and concluding with a session on R&amp;D developments in Week 8.   <br />
<br />
The default format will be lectures given as timetabled face-to-face discussion sessions.  Lectures will use conventional powerpoints with supporting written commentaries, and subtitles where relevant, complemented by video clips. Both will be accessed and referred to in the online sessions or the face-to-face lecture / discussion sessions.  <br />
<br />
The second component will consist of the following:  <br />
<br />
A Question Time style panel debate on one or more of the key issues surrounding the Implementing Geological Disposal programme in the UK. This is scheduled to occur in week 9 of semester. It will be a hybrid face-to-face (students and UoE staff) / online (UK and overseas expert panellists) event within a timetabled session. The Panel will most likely include representatives from national Waste Management Organisations, including UK WMO (Nuclear Waste Services, NWS) and one or more of NAGRA (Switzerland), BGE (Germany) and Posiva (Finland) or SKB (Sweden). An independent international expert will also act as a panellist.  <br />
<br />
The third component will be the Student Poster Presentation Event.   <br />
<br />
Students will select one from a suite of relevant nuclear waste topics on which they will prepare a poster and present that poster within a dedicated, conference style, &quot;Poster Session&quot;. The topics will include those that trace and assess the state of nuclear waste management in specific countries, and others that focus on cross-cutting themes such as screening, siting, geosphere characterisation, key R&amp;D topics, URLs, and issues associated with developing a GDF.  <br />
<br />
The taught part of the Course will begin with an overview of nuclear power generation, the production of wastes, and the national and international regulatory and legal frameworks for nuclear waste management. The variety of waste types, their treatment and storage options, and the research and development issues associated with these will be outlined, leading to an understanding of radioactive waste inventories, especially for final disposal. The options for the disposal of nuclear waste, including near-surface disposal and deep borehole disposal, will be introduced, leading to a detailed analysis of deep geological disposal in conceptual Geological Disposal Facilities (GDFs).   <br />
<br />
Safety Cases for GDFs in the main prospective rock types will be introduced, leading to an analysis of the roles of engineered barriers and the geological barrier in the three main disposal concepts. The requirements for subsurface characterisation to support safe geological disposal and importance of Underground Research Laboratories in this will be explained. The significance of natural analogues for Safety Case arguments will also be explored.  <br />
<br />
Having developed an understanding of the scientific, regulatory and safety issues surrounding nuclear waste management, the course will progress students through the key issues associated with finding, selecting and selling a Geological Disposal Facility to communities and the public. Approaches to this in the UK and other nations will be examined. Public understanding and acceptance issues associated with volunteerism, engagement, community benefit, decision-making and rights of withdrawal will be introduced. The role of geology and geological information will be further discussed with respect to screening, site identification, site selection and site assessment. The current approach to implementing geological disposal (IGD) in the UK will be highlighted and compared with both previous attempts (UK) and approaches being adopted elsewhere.  <br />
<br />
The detailed course content, which should be noted as being indicative rather than definitive, is provided below.  <br />
<br />
First Week (Week 4 of Semester 2):     <br />
<br />
Introduction and Framework: Introduction to the Course: aims, approach, organisation. Introduction to nuclear energy: natural radioactivity, definitions - activity and dose. Nuclear fission. Types of nuclear reactors, implications for the nuclear fuel types and wastes. Nuclear energy statistics and economics (global and national).  Regulatory controls on nuclear operations and nuclear waste management: laws, regulations and requirements. IAEA, NEA, Euratom. Fukushima. The IAEA requirements for safety in nuclear waste disposal. The UK context and framework in brief (ONR, EA, SEPA other bodies).  <br />
<br />
Second Week (Week 5 of Semester 2)<br />
<br />
Waste types, inventories. Waste treatment and conditioning: Types of radioactive waste and how they arise: reactor, operational, reprocessing, and decommissioning. Classifications of waste: VLLW, LLW, ILW (SL-ILW and LL-ILW), HLW, HAW; TRU waste. Material not declared as waste: Spent fuel, Plutonium, Uranium. Implications for storage and disposal options. The Waste Hierarchy and what it means in practice. Waste treatment: ILW: current concepts and some future prospects (cement grouting, thermal treatment, alternative matrices). HLW: vitirification and canister storage. Alternative treatments (ceramics, synroc, transmutation). Further examples. The concept of the radioactive waste Inventory. Example inventory - the UK inventory for disposal.  <br />
