<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">This course introduces students to twentieth and twenty-first century African American and Black British artists for whom the fight for the right to power over the word let alone over the image is a fight that is far from over. As Black artist, Charles White declared, it is not only 'words' but 'images' that are 'weapons' in the arsenal of historic and contemporary Black freedom and resistance movements. Living and dying against a centuries long backdrop of US plantation slavery, segregation, lynchlaw and an unending struggle for civil, moral, social, and political rights in a contemporary Black Lives Matter era, African American and Black British artists have and continue to experience a difficult relationship with dominant iconographic no less than narrative modes. White mainstream cultures work to invisibilise, distort and deny Black histories, memories, and narratives over the centuries. Given the fact that literacy was obtained on pain of death - during the height of chattel slavery, an enslaved person's success in learning to read and write was met with terrible persecution and bloody reprisals from white racists intent on the subjugation of Black peoples - a vast majority of Black women and men on both sides of the Atlantic turned to visual culture out of necessity to bring their stories to life. While only a few individuals were able to gain access to pen and paper to write their story down, vast numbers were able to commemorate their lives by using the materials they found around them on the plantations. These included stone to make sculptures; wood to make carved figures; beads to make necklaces; animal hides to make instruments; found objects to make religious altars; fabric to make quilts. This course will introduce students to a number of artists working in the last fifty years in order to trace the alternative narrative practices and storytelling traditions that remain integral to different forms of Black visual cultures in the UK and US. Using images and not words, African American and Black British artists rely on their art-making practices to disseminate histories, memories, narratives as they come to grips with lives that have been written out of the history books let alone the dominant literary and artistic cultures. In this course, we will examine the ways in which Black artists work not with a textual but with a visual language to tell the stories of missing Black lives across their paintings, sculptures, drawings, quilting, ceramics, woodcarving, photography, murals, posters, digital, installation, video and performance art. This is an introductory course which assumes no prior knowledge either of Black Studies or art historical analysis. No student needs to come with any prior experience of reading images or understanding visual culture as they will be provided with all the necessary analytical tools they need during the course.</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    This course will provide students with an overall knowledge and understanding of twentieth and twenty-first century African American and Black British visual culture and art-making traditions in the UK and US by examining the paintings, drawings, sculpture, ceramics, quilts, murals, posters, performance, video, digital, and street art produced by artists working in the last fifty years. This course will require no prior understanding of academic practices within art history: all the necessary analytical tools will be provided within the course and will directly draw upon the skills that students have already developed in literary analysis and critical theory. This course will not only examine the individual works produced by each of these artists but will situate these nontextual objects within their wider cultural, literary, historical, political, social, and aesthetic contexts. The major themes and concerns will include: race and representation; identity politics; bodily trauma; psychological suffering; gender inequalities; aesthetic experimentation; radicalism and resistance; history; oral memories; family traditions. This course will also address fundamental formal dimensions including colour and composition as well as the aesthetic and political implications of creating paintings, drawings, murals, posters, sculpture, performance and digital art. On the basis of students' preparatory reading around artists and their artworks and their examination of artists - and critics - writings as drawn from a range of disciplines, seminars will be used to discuss the visual, cultural, literary, philosophical, historical, psychological, social, and political implications of different forms of African American and Black British visual culture. In order to fully prepare for these seminar discussions, students will be required to meet in advance in smaller 'autonomous learning groups' to produce material which will be presented to the class in a variety of forms (written reports posted to the course vle, informal contributions to class discussion, or more formal verbal presentations during the seminar). Active preparation for and participation in class discussion is required, and will be assessed as a part of the student's overall performance on the course. The structure of reading and analysis on the course is broadly comparative: students will be asked to explore the similarities and differences between the set artists and artworks, and examine the various types of analysis made possible by the critical and theoretical modes of visual culture to which they are introduced. The guided examination of the similarities and differences between the range of artists and art objects and approaches studied will help students to develop the analytical skills and knowledge that will be assessed in their essays. Due to the vast number of still unexamined artworks within African American and Black British visual culture traditions - 'new' works are being unearthed and 'new' artists are making themselves known on the cultural and political scene all the time - there is plenty of scope for students to undertake original research and develop new theoretical models that will shed light on key formal and thematic dimensions of these works created by Black artists and which still remain vastly under-researched. The course is assessed by two essays, one to be completed by Week 10 of the course and one to be written during the exam period, and an assessment of students' participation in class and their autonomous learning groups. Written feedback will be provided on each element of assessment, and further oral follow-up feedback from the tutor will be available for anyone who would like it.
