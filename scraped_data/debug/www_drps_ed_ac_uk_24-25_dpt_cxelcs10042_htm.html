<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">This course foregrounds and models the key concepts, theories and approaches needed to access and evaluate past manifestations of Scandinavian culture. Its main thematic focus will be the series of developments and events encountered from the 8th to the 11th century, and referred to collectively as 'The Viking Age'. The course has two complimentary dimensions: The first of these introduces three broad 'Topics' in Viking culture, comprising six key 'Strands' as evidenced by contemporary and near-contemporary material, from archaeological, art-historical, and documentary sources. The second centres the appropriation and repurposing of this material in six cultural developments from the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries, highlighting the profound impact this has had on literature, politics, film and popular culture throughout the Western World. The emphasis throughout is on methodology and process. Each Strand begins by fronting common preconceptions, before highlighting the significance of context in unpacking the meaning and significance of different types of evidence used to frame cultural narratives on the Viking Age. On successful completion of the course, students will have refined the skills and strategies needed to assess how and why representations of Viking Age culture in more recent times have diverged from the material realities of the Viking Age itself. They will, moreover, have gained expertise in tailoring their articulation of those ideas to the requirements of different media.</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    The term 'Viking' is a ship that comes laden with heavy baggage. Thanks to an endless reel of films, tv-shows, video games and (graphic!) novels, we all 'know' the Vikings as expert seafarers, fearless warriors and brutal pagans. They stand out as free-spirited bands of brothers and adventurers who pillaged and plundered their way across Europe from around AD 750 until conversion to Christianity made them realise the error of their ways a few hundred years later. But the sense of danger, excitement and equality that surrounds their exploits in the popular imagination does not come from the words of the Vikings themselves. Disappointingly for some, most of the more familiar notions and clichÃ©s of Viking life can be traced back to writers of the 19th century, striving to thrill, shock and inspire their readers with tales of noble, and sometimes less than noble savagery. The boring truth is that there were no horned helmets, that the Vikings had no monopoly on violence, and that they inflicted considerably less grief on the rest of the world in the name of their religious beliefs than the Christians they are said to have troubled. This context raises several inter-related questions foundational to this course: What was Viking life actually like? What kinds of evidence survive? How do we interpret them? And if things really were so different from the modern clichÃ©s, who felt the need to develop them, and why?  <br />
<br />
This course is aimed at students who aspire to work in the cultural heritage sector. By examining the main preconceptions on Viking Age culture in the light of the surviving evidence from the Viking Age itself, it aims to develop the skills in analysis and presentation needed to unpack and describe those phenomena. By reviewing the societal context and agendas of the cultural movements which lie behind the evolution of the modern Viking 'image', students will learn how to navigate the route between fact and fiction more securely, and understand how and why two centuries of unbroken and expansive political and cultural developments have connected the Western world to the Vikings. Finally, and following training in both academic and popular writing, including analytical essays and magazine articles, students will also gain confidence and practical skills in presenting these topics to different audiences. <br />
<br />
Teaching delivery is based around six key 'Topics': The Vikings at Home; Raids &amp; Realms; The Viking Outlook; Constructing the Viking Image; Appropriating the Viking Image; The Vikings in Popular Culture. <br />
<br />
Each Topic is further divided into two more nuanced 'Strands', which will cover a broad range of preconceptions, evidence, conceptual approaches, and more recent appropriation of Viking Age culture. Each Strand sets out from the image of an associated artefact, and a short extract from a relevant primary text. Introductory materials will foreground common preconceptions on the topic, provide a manageable amount of required reading, and a selection of recommended reading, covering texts, web-based resources, databases, and audio-visual materials. The format of each strand seminar is the same - combining components of introduction, context, modelling, group-discussion and dissemination, and conclusions.
