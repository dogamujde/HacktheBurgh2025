<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    1) Academic Description <br />
 <br />
This course is offered as part of the Access Programme (Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences). The Access Programme aims to prepare students for undergraduate study by introducing them to a range of essential skills and encouraging them to employ these<br />
skills in a confident and flexible way.<br />
<br />
Having established a strong foundation through semester 1 courses, semester 2 courses will adopt a more in-depth scholarly approach, preparing students for progression to undergraduate study.<br />
<br />
This semester 2 course will provide a supportive, stimulating and creative environment in which to build upon the skills gained in Access Art and Design 1. Students will continue to develop and refine their skills and artistic maturity to create an individually-tailored portfolio for entry to the wide variety of art and design degree programmes (e.g. Art, Intermedia Art, Painting, Photography, Sculpture, Fine Art, Animation, Fashion, Film &amp; Television, Graphic Design, Illustration, Interior Design, Jewellery &amp; Silversmithing, Performance Costume, Product Design, Textiles, etc.). <br />
<br />
The initial focus of the course is in refining individually-tailored portfolios for submission to degree programmes, to enable the student to evidence their artistic ability and potential in their chosen pathways. In line with portfolio assessment criteria, four key areas will be blended into the learning journey: enquiry and visual research; idea development and material/technical exploration; critical judgement, reflection and resolution; and contextual awareness. <br />
<br />
Practical work will be focussed around a live brief, enabling students to demonstrate independent creative exploration. Transferable skills such as teamwork, communication and time management will be embedded into the course.  Advanced workshops will be delivered in a range of drawing and 2d/3d skills and techniques, visual recording, mixed-media experimentation and confidence building, digital engagement, and presentation of a final resolved body of work.<br />
<br />
2) Course Content  <br />
 <br />
This course is designed around completing individual digital portfolio requirements for entry to degree programmes in the creative arts and building upon the skills and knowledge developed in Access Art and Design 1 to create comprehensive physical portfolios and a resolved body of work. Each of the sixteen-practical studio (or site-specific) sessions will introduce a range of contemporary art/design issues, along with current debates in contemporary culture to inspire and stimulate the students' work and provide greater depth to portfolios. The course will include workshops on portfolio visual presentation to encourage a critically refined submission; and supportive, individually-tailored creative workshops. To prepare the student for progression, reading/research will be encouraged to be synthesised with individual pathways/year one of potential degree programmes.<br />
<br />
Students will present their individual projects to the group following a creative confidence-building workshop, and progress to develop experimental and resolved outcomes through exploration at intensive workshops in contemporary collage, colour, painting and mixed-media, 2d/3d surface treatment, and digital experimentation and printmaking. As part of their summative submission students will present their resolved work alongside their portfolio of ideas, studies and sketchbooks. <br />
 <br />
3) Student Learning Experience  <br />
 <br />
Students will continue to develop through weekly studio-based and practical enquiry in a creative and supportive environment. Students will be inspired by short seminars of contemporary art/design and cultural issues, to strengthen their practice's theoretical engagement. Whilst the course is structured towards the broad needs for all programmes of continued study, students will continue to be reflective learners, working towards their chosen pathways through independent research, journal and portfolio development.<br />
<br />
As with most art and design courses, students will receive regular <br />
verbal appraisal throughout the course, both on a one-to-one basis and in critiques; analysing and reflecting on their work through tutor led discussions.<br />
<br />
A formative presentation and assessment of work in progress will take place around week 9 to prepare the student for the journey ahead. Constructive feedback (both verbal and written) will be provided by the course tutor. Students will be encouraged to consider feedback and to respond to this in future work. <br />
<br />
In addition to support and feedback at course level, all students on the Access Programme will engage via an online learning journal, where they will be prompted to reflect on their learning experience, feedback and progress and will receive personalised guidance and support from their Personal Tutor. <br />
<br />
Students will also participate in a range of cultural and social engagement activities which are intended to complement their studies, increase cultural capital, encourage engagement with peers and communities, and build a sense of belonging.<br />

<td class="rowhead1" stlye="width:15%;">Additional Information (Assessment)</td>
<td colspan="14">There will be one formative and one summative assessment linked to the learning outcomes for the course and focussed on developing students' visual research, development and critical thinking skills in preparation for entry to degree courses. <br />
Formative Assessment<br />
Undertaken around week 9, and focusing on the project work, an in-person or digital presentation lasting around 15 minutes and consisting of 10 slides to the tutor and student group. The presentation will consist of the student's conceptual framework, work-in-progress and developing ideas for resolved outcomes, followed by tutor-led peer assessment and written feedback. <br />
Summative Assessment <br />
A digital presentation or physical portfolio submission, which will be uploaded to Learn and assessed against the 3 learning outcomes. Each learning outcome will be equally weighted at 33.3% and marked with a percentage grade. <br />
This is usually two weeks after the last taught class, the course work will be summatively assessed, and students will receive a provisional grade and mark within 15 working days of the assessment.<br />
<br />
The submission should comprise:<br />
<br />
A physical portfolio of work<br />
The portfolio of works should be presented in a clear and professional manner appropriate to the discipline. The submission should include work undertaken within the class as well as directed and independent study outwith the classes. <br />
<br />
This should demonstrate a student's practical engagement, and accounts for 100% (200 hours) of the indicative hours of the course, and feeds into all three Learning Outcomes. <br />
<br />
This should include:<br />
<br />
- A sketchbook(s) of visual ideas, research, preparatory and developmental studies, along with evidence of contextual awareness.  (LO.1)<br />
- A body of developed ideas and studies, appropriate to the directed and any self-directed study activities. (LO.2)<br />
- A physical presentation of resolved works that have been derived from the various directed and self-directed projects. (LO.3)<br />
- The student should also provide a written statement describing the research, development and resolution of their work in their submission of no more than 250 words. (LO.1; LO.2; LO.3)<br />
<br />
The portfolio submission will be assessed against the three Learning Outcomes. Those Learning Outcomes are equally weighted (33.3%) and students will be given a percentage grade for each and an average calculated. <br />
To pass, a student needs to attain a minimum of 40% when all three learning outcomes are totalled and averaged.<br />
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" stlye="width:15%;">Feedback</td>
<td colspan="14">Students will be given regular (verbal) individual support, to help build confidence and commitment, and enable a smooth transition to individual chosen degree pathways. Tutorial support (verbal and written) will continue in relation to developing practical work, and tutor-led group/peer assessment (verbal) will take place weekly following workshop activities. Following the formative assessment, indicative and supportive feedback will be summarised in written form which will give an indication of what areas require to be addressed in order to meet the published learning outcomes and maximise each student's learning potential. <br />
<br />
Students will receive a final assessed mark/grade on completion of Access Art and Design 2 following the summative assessment.<br />
<br />
Students will also be prompted to reflect on feedback via the online learning journal and will be provided with personalised guidance and support from their Personal Tutor.<br />
