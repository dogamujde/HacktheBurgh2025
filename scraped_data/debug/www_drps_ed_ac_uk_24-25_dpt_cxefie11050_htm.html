The course blends a wider global perspective on this theme with close-up, practical, case studies and a challenge-based learning strategy (e.g. cases of refugees and migrants finding work online, being counted, and navigating the risks of ICT that makes people visible). <br />
<br />
Students will work collaboratively to understand micro- and macro-level dynamics that shape migrants and refugees' digital lives today, while also being challenged to innovate practical solutions to problems (e.g. platforms that help rather than prevent refugees and migrants find work).</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    This course offers students an intensive deep dive into the digital lives and livelihoods of migrants and refugees, exploring aspects such as digital work and e-commerce, digital data, and ICT-enabled education. The course takes an approach that blends macro-level analysis with challenge-based case studies and collaborative peer work.<br />
<br />
Phase one is fully online and allows students to work in groups to each find answers to a specific challenge posed by the course conveners. They include themes such as: <br />
<br />
(1) How have refugees used smartphones to meet specific challenges of their situation? <br />
(2) How can refugees work online? <br />
(3) What is the data that is used to support but also control refugees? <br />
<br />
This phase will culminate in each group producing a video presentation on a specific challenge. Phase two is the 'integration and exposure' phase. It is over an intensive two-day period and includes interactive lectures introducing the key themes, as well as a chance to develop the responses to the first phase's challenges through engagement with a wide range of practitioners who have had to face these challenges in practice. The final phase is the development and writing of a short individual policy paper related to the general challenge.<br />
<br />
Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:<br />
<br />
The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities.<br />
<br />
Students should be aware that:<br />
- Classrooms used in this course will have additional technology in place: students might not be able to sit in areas away from microphones or outside the field of view of all cameras.<br />
- Unless the lecturer or tutor indicates otherwise you should assume the session is being recorded.<br />
<br />
As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.

<td class="rowhead1" stlye="width:15%;">Additional Information (Assessment)</td>
<td colspan="14">Summative Assessment:<br />
<br />
The course will be assessed by means of the following components:<br />
<br />
1) Group Presentation (30%)<br />
<br />
This is a team-based analysis of a given challenge, using course material and data gathered from desk-research by the group. It is submitted before the intensive part of the course. The output will be prepared as a pre-recorded video presentation (max. 15 minutes run-time) and relevant guidance on how to compile such a group video will be provided. <br />
<br />
The group mark will be assessed based on their ability to integrate knowledge and research findings into a clear presentation, and their ability to think critically about course readings and other materials. Moreover, assessment will take into account the overall quality of the answers provided in response to the challenge, presentation skills, and teamwork skills (i.e. equal and fair distribution of workload and presentation tasks - all group members will receive the same mark). <br />
<br />
2) Individual Policy Paper (70%)<br />
<br />
This will be an individual policy paper that builds on the insights gained from the course. The paper will be related to the theme of the initial group work but offers an opportunity to apply a stronger focus that is of interest to the individual student.  The format is in the style of a policy brief at a length of around 1,500-2,000 words. <br />
<br />
Formative Assessment:<br />
<br />
Each course within Edinburgh Futures Institute includes the opportunity for you to participate in a formative feedback exercise or event which will help you prepare for your summative assessment. The formative assessment does not contribute to your overall course mark.<br />
<br />
Live light-touch formative feedback will be given during online contributions in phase one of the course, as well as the group work during the 2-day intensive period.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" stlye="width:15%;">Feedback</td>
<td colspan="14">Feedback on the formative assessment may be provided in various formats, for example, to include written, oral, video, face-to-face, whole class, or individual. The course organiser will decide which format is most appropriate in relation to the nature of the assessment.<br />
<br />
Feedback on both formative and summative in-course assessed work will be provided in time to be of use in subsequent assessments within the course.<br />
<br />
Feedback on the summative assessment will be provided in written form via Learn, the University of Edinburgh's Virtual Learning Environment (VLE).<br />
<br />
The feedback in phase one will primarily focus on developing effective and focused presentations (component one being a presentation), the summative feedback will get back to these aspects, but will also be accompanied with more formative feedback (after the presentation and during in-person interactions) on turning the presentations and ideas from the 2-day intensive into actual policy recommendations (the final summative assessment).</td>
