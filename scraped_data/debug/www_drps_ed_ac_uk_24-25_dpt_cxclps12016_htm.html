<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">During the Neuropsychology and Older Adult Placement trainees will gain a good working knowledge of the problems which present in the area of Older Adults. Having acquired an understanding of a range of theoretical and therapeutic models, trainees will have opportunity to apply these in clinical practice. Trainees should have experience in working with people who have a range of needs, some of which may relate to functional and organic diagnosis. As a substantial amount of care is provided for older people through multi-disciplinary teamwork, trainees should be made aware of the advantages and limitations of teamwork with older people. Core placement experience guidelines outlining a more complete range of experiences, clinical interventions, problems and settings that trainees can expect to encounter can be found in the NHS and Clinical Practice Placement Handbook.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    a) Academic description.  <br />
<br />
The placement will take place in NHS settings, normally under the supervision of a Clinical Psychologist. There may be situations where trainees are supervised by more than one supervisor, by other Applied Psychologist(s) (e.g. Counselling, Forensic), or by members of other professions according to the Programme Eligibility criteria for supervisors which are found in the NHS and Clinical Practice Placements Handbook. In the remainder of this text the word supervisor denotes supervisor(s).  <br />
<br />
Depending on the availability of placements, it may be that some trainees will complete a split placement working with Older Adults alongside placement experience in a different specialty.<br />
<br />
The placement will be scheduled to last for a minimum of 5-6 months and trainees will typically be on placement for 4 days each week, apart from weeks when they have teaching. During the placement, trainees are required to demonstrate principles of work relevant to clinical psychology practice and the application of evidence-based practice governed by psychological models and concepts. <br />
<br />
During this Clinical Placement, trainees will have 1 study day per week, apart from weeks when they are in teaching (see Handbook for details). This time is for reading and study relating to placement as well as relating to thesis and any academic coursework. Some trainees may use an additional half-day per week of study to complete their Thesis (for RPL trainees) or their Small Scale Research Project (for non-RPL trainees) - see Handbook for details. <br />
<br />
b) Outline content <br />
<br />
Trainees should have a range of clinical experience characteristic of that likely to be encountered in general psychological practice. If the trainee is on a split placement, particular key experiences will be prioritised.<br />
<br />
Experience would typically include: <br />
<br />
1) Assessment procedures at individual, systemic and societal levels <br />
2) Assessment of cognitive and functional capabilities <br />
3) Establishing a formulation <br />
4) Direct treatment with patients with whom they are the prime worker <br />
5) Experience in behavioural and cognitive approaches to treatment is considered essential. Some exposure to alternative treatment approaches is strongly recommended and might include IPT, ACT or CAT. <br />
6) Indirect work with patients with whom they are the prime worker (e.g. advising staff or relatives) <br />
7) Collaborative work as part of a multi-disciplinary team. Trainees are expected to participate fully in multi-disciplinary teamwork especially in aspects concerned with individual case management, with which they are involved (e.g. referral meetings, case discussions, individual planning meetings, community dementia team meeting, social work liaison meetings, etc). <br />
8) Direct contact includes remote delivery of psychological assessment and treatment. <br />
9) All trainees are to complete client feedback questionnaires with at least two clients per placement and a session-by-session feedback questionnaire on client experience with at least one client during training.<br />
<br />
c) Student Learning Experience <br />
<br />
Trainees will be on placement in NHS settings working clinically with clients. The placement may take place across different locations or services. Trainees should have taken on sufficient cases such that they can demonstrate principles of work relevant to clinical psychology practice and the application of evidence based practice governed by psychological models and concepts. This should involve both assessment only and treatment cases. <br />
<br />
Supervision will be provided in line with the Programme and BPS/HCPC guidelines. Trainees can expect to observe their supervisor(s) on at least 5 occasions during the placement. Trainees can expect to  be observed by their supervisor on at least 5 occasions during the placement, in order to receive feedback on their performance and for the supervisor to be able to evaluate their progress towards their standard and personalised learning objectives and implementation of agreed changes. It is expected that the supervisor(s) will use a structured assessment of competence to provide formative feedback on at least 3 of these observations of the trainee. The placement is assessed by performance on placement, as outlined by the Evaluation of Clinical Competence (ECC) form. This is completed by the clinical supervisor(s) and is reviewed, along with the additional placement paperwork, at the mid placement and end of placement meetings.

<td class="rowhead1" stlye="width:15%;">Feedback</td>
<td colspan="14">Formative feedback is given on an ongoing basis as part of regular supervision and case discussion. It is also given after the trainee is observed by the supervisor, whether by sitting in with a trainee's session or by using a video or audio recording of a session. As described above, for some observations, the supervisor is expected to use a Structured Assessment of Competence to provide the trainee with specific formative feedback, for example on their CBT or systemic competences. Detailed formative feedback is given prior to the mid-placement visit, when the supervisor completes the Evaluation of Clinical Competence (ECC) Form. The supervisor discusses this with the trainee in advance of the mid-placement visit. During the mid-placement visit, the ECC is discussed with the trainee and the supervisor by the mid-placement visitor. <br />
<br />
Summative feedback is provided at the end of placement by the supervisor completing the ECC form, to make a recommendation regarding the placement grade, and this is discussed  with the trainee. The ECC form and other placement documentation are reviewed at  the End of Placement meeting or Joint Annual Review where the decision is made on the placement grade that will be submitted to the Board of Examiners. <br />
<br />
Please refer to Section 3 of the NHS and Clinical Practice Placement Handbook for full guidance on mid-placement visits, End of Placement meetings and Joint Annual Reviews.</td>
