<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">This 20-credit course examines the role of the teacher as a professional with responsibility for supporting diverse learners in the classroom as well as preparing these learners to socialize, work and live in a complex and diverse world. The course explores historical and philosophical approaches to individual needs, building on the concepts of child development covered in Education 2a and assists in preparing students for future school placements where relevant. In this course students will deepen their understanding of inclusion and citizenship education, they will begin to look critically at policy and the politics of education, and the ways in which policies are constructed and implemented. Additionally, students will develop their knowledge and understanding towards the role of teacher as an agent for change and using their own personal experience they will share thoughts in order to build the school of the future.</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    The course is divided in two blocks. <br />
<br />
In Block 1: Policy and Practice for Inclusion, Weeks 1 to 5 are focused on different areas of inclusion and the diversity of learners teachers meet in the course of their work. Students are asked to consider teachers' importance as a role model for learners, an agent of transformation and change, and the pivotal point through which educational policy can be enacted in educational settings.  As the weeks move on, they will look at Additional Support Needs, race and multiculturalism, and physical impairments of various kinds to see how they can ensure their teaching practices meet different learners' needs in the light of inclusion and social justice. <br />
<br />
In Block 2: Schools of the Future, Weeks 5 to 11 build on the gained knowledge and understanding to consider the purposes and role of schooling, the development of future inclusive schools in the context of globalisation, sustainability and social justice and the role of future teachers, in shaping education and prepare critical learners. A key part of the course is to critically consider the contribution of research to educational policy development as well as the influence of practice on shaping the research and educational policy agenda through, for example, critical discourse analysis.<br />
<br />
During the course, students will spend time on placement in a range of settings to gain experience of interactions between schools and various agencies aimed at supporting pupils and families and enhancing the educational experiences of learners in different environments including different areas across Scotland. Students will develop their skills in document analysis as a qualitative research method by examining legislation and policy that promotes inclusion, equality and children's rights and considers multi-agency approaches and partnerships in supporting pupils learning in different environments.<br />
