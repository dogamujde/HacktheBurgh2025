<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">The detail of what will be studied is outlined in the different course strand course booklets. The focus of the teaching is application of theory to classroom practice in traditional and non-traditional learning spaces. This SCQF level 11 course helps student teachers to engage in new ways of thinking and engaging in practice as they develop the knowledge, skills and dispositions needed for 21st century classrooms. The course enables student teachers to draw on principles of sustainability, social justice, citizenship, linguistic and cultural diversity and inclusion to critique, analyse and reflect on the wider landscape of Scottish education, and the changing nature of a more global educational context. <br />
<br />
The four strands of this programme (Critical Literacy; Teaching in Multiliterate Classrooms; Learning in the Outdoors and Philosophy with Children) have been designed to engage PGDE Secondary students in aspects of learning and teaching which will enhance their efficacy and understanding of how to apply these teaching architectures to their practice. Study of these strands will give students the opportunity to reflect critically on the multi-faceted role of teachers in the secondary school in terms of effective and innovative teaching and learning. In addition, study of these strands will address our core commitments to education where we support student teachers in thinking critically about moving beyond their subject areas, and to build a pedagogic repertoire that enables them to challenge discrimination in all its forms, respecting disciplines, languages and cultures within the student population and beyond. As such, this course supports the philosophy of life-long professional learning and reflexive praxis.</td>

<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    Course content is designed to engage and familiarise student teacher in their role as a critical and analytical agent of change, improvement and development in education, as well as an effective, reflexive practitioner, as they work towards forging their own individual identity as a transformative teacher. <br />
<br />
This SCQF level 11 course helps build a strong foundation in student teachers; knowledge and appreciation of the wider landscape of national and international education, whilst developing students; understanding of their professional remit and responsibilities as a teacher in the classroom, in the school and in society. This preparation is firmly in accordance with the GTCS Standard for Provisional Registration and takes full account of the Donaldson Review of Teacher Education (2010).  <br />
<br />
Students work and learn in multi-disciplinary groups, exploring the implications and expectations of educational theory being employed effectively in practice. As the key part of this process, students are required to read and respond critically and analytically to research based literature, educational policy and government legislation relating to a wide range of salient issues, themes and topics, including inclusive pedagogies and diversity in education.  <br />
<br />
In sum, this course teaches, guides and encourages student teachers to engage in: reflective and reflexive practice; individual and collaborative based  critical engagement with relevant and contemporary academic literature and professional documentation. The overarching aim is to improve and develop students; professional skills and abilities, knowledge and understanding, in order to enable them to become an informed and effective classroom practitioner, as well as an agent of educational change and future improvement.
