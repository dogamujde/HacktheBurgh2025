This will be examined alongside a range of biological, social, economic, political, cultural and generational factors. These influences are considered in relation to two core themes: learning, attainment and personal development; and health, safety and physical activity. During the course particular attention is paid to children and young people's experiences in relation to periods of transition. Emphasis is also placed on the extent to which children and young people themselves actively shape their own lives.</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    Academic description<br />
This interdisciplinary course draws on theoretical frameworks and research findings from Developmental Psychology, Childhood Studies and Youth Studies to explore two broad interlinked aspects of children and young people's lives:<br />
<br />
- Learning, attainment and personal development<br />
- Health, safety and physical activity<br />
<br />
On this course students will build on the knowledge and expertise they developed on the Children and Young People (1) course, and will have the opportunity to apply this learning to the examination of the additional aspects of children and young people's lives listed above. In particular, students will extend their critical understanding of theory and research from a range of social science disciplines used to understand the lives of children and young people (including education, psychology, sociology and social policy). Throughout, classic and contemporary theory and research are used to explore the two themes in detail, critically considering:<br />
<br />
- how these aspects are considered within key policies, including the Curriculum for Excellence (particularly within the Health and Wellbeing strand) and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.<br />
- the micro- and macro- influences on these aspects of the lives of children and young people, including biological, social, economic, political, cultural and generational influences, with particular attention paid to issues of inequality and intersectionality<br />
- the extent to which educators influence these aspects of the lives of children and young people <br />
- children and young people's rights and the extent to which they actively influence these aspects of their own lives.<br />
<br />
Throughout, the course will build on Children and Young People (1) by extending the exploration of young people's experiences of transition (e.g. from nursery to primary, into secondary, and post-school transition), and by including a specific practical focus on post-transition issues.<br />
<br />
During the course, students' campus-based studies will be complemented by site-based learning in educational and community settings, allowing them to develop a critical awareness of current issues relating to the lives of children and young people, and to actively engage in consideration of how drawing upon research evidence from social science disciplines can enable them to affect change in the lives of the children and young people with whom they work.<br />
<br />
Student Learning Experience<br />
The course includes: <br />
- on-campus classes, which will take the form of seminars, panel discussions, and small group activities (10 hours)<br />
- self-directed study, which will include reading, seminar preparation, assessment work, and site-based learning (90 hours)
