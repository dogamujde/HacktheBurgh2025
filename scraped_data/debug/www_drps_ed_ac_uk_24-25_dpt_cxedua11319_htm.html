<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">This course explores how the assessment of students and their learning is rapidly evolving in ways that capitalise on developments in digital technologies considering pedagogical and technological considerations, as well as conceptual and practical issues.  Underpinning our exploration is a review of key assessment purposes, processes and guiding principles which allows us to take a more questioning eye to newly emerging and more established directions in digital education and assessment.  <br />
<br />
The purpose of this course is to provide participants with the opportunity to engage with online assessment and the issues it raises, both practically and theoretically.  It will provide the opportunity for participants to relate what they learn through the interactions and activities of the course to their own context, discipline or institution.  The course is aimed at instructors, tutors or teachers who have an interest in digital assessments and who would like to engage more deeply with aspects of the topic.<br />
<br />
Students from outwith the Digital Education programme wishing to enrol for this course or take it on a 'class only' basis must liaise directly with the course secretary before enrolling.</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    The course covers:<br />
*Assessment purposes and perspectives.  The course opens with an opportunity to review your experiences of being assessed and share with others your initial thoughts on what makes for a good assessment. We then turn to the fundamental question of what purposes can underlie assessment, how different 'stakeholders' tend to vary in which purposes they value most, and what tensions may arise from these differences.<br />
*Frameworks and principles.  A recurring theme in the assessment literature is the problematic interrelationship between assessment-for-grading ('summative assessment') and assessment- for-learning ('formative assessment'), allied to concerns that the former has all too often flourished at the expense of the latter. Here we invite you to take a critical look at a number of frameworks and manifestos that each seek to put assessment-for- learning to the forefront and articulate evidence-informed guiding principles.<br />
*Digital contexts and multimodal assessments.  Novel, online forms of assessment provoke new questions about what the informal ground-rules (and even the implications for more formal assessment regulations) might be.  This theme explores the implications for assessment in digital environments.  We will examine a variety of actual online assessments and consider how they open up opportunities for students to communicate what they know, understand and can do and how they ask us, as educators, to consider the interpretative role of the assessor and to re-think conventional wisdom about assessment and feedback.<br />
*Feedback, feedforward and dialogue.  Here we focus on the opportunities digital environments afford to enhance assessment-for-learning by facilitating and boosting guidance and feedback to students on their progress and performance. We will consider applications that range from comments on coursework assignments, through initiatives that enable students to self-test periodically, to electronic voting systems that provide a systematic check on how well what has been taught has been understood.<br />
*Assessment literacy.  Traditionally, assessment has been a relatively arcane and mysterious practice - understood only by those few judged sufficiently expert to be assessors in a given field and taking place in private, behind closed doors. But the mysteries of assessment have been falling away, and there has been growing recognition that itÂ¿s hard for students to perform consistently well if they donÂ¿t have a good grasp of what high-quality work looks like, and of how to go about achieving it. This Â¿insiderÂ¿ view of assessment practices is precisely what Â¿assessment literacyÂ¿ aims to develop in students. Here we explore emerging perspectives on assessment literacy and the activities designed to promote it, such as peer review and the use of exemplars.<br />
*Collaborative learning and assessment.  Digital technologies have opened up exciting new opportunities for students to work collaboratively, whether through new forms of communication and interaction as they pursue shared or pooled tasks, or through co-authoring tools that allow writing and revising of joint publications, presentations or other output.  But assessing such collaborative activities also poses tricky issues for educational systems that have traditionally evaluated and rewarded individual rather than group endeavour and where the borderlines between cooperation and collusion may be fuzzy rather than clear-cut.   During this theme we will tease out some of our own ways of working collaboratively in preparation for our own group-based assessment.<br />
*Emerging themes and the Â¿big questionsÂ¿ assignment.  Here we explore some of the emerging challenges that new technologies might bring to traditional understandings of the relationship between teacher, student and assessment.  We will also be engaging in our group-based assessment for the course, our 'Big Questions' assignment.<br />
<br />
ALDE, as with all our courses, is delivered entirely online, using as its main delivery platform the virtual learning environment Moodle, but also making extensive use of environments for collaborative working and assessment (e.g. wiki, Google Doc) and synchronous sessions (e.g. Skype, Adobe Connect, Discord).<br />
 <br />
The approach to teaching in the course takes various forms. Most weeks will include guided core and follow-up reading from a range of sources, alongside various activities like forum discussions, group authoring, and synchronous seminars.  In particular, in this course, we value sharing our experiences and insights with one another, alongside what we discover along the way Â¿ a new idea or application, for instance, or an unfamiliar term that can be put to good use. And through the assignments, you will have the chance to review developments in digital assessment in a field of your own choosing.<br />
 <br />
Successful participation in this course will require around 7-10 hours a week in discussion, reading, exploration and writing, with more than this likely around the time of assignment completion. As suggested in the introduction to this handbook, you will need to make a significant commitment to the course in order to contribute to class discussions, activities and the collaborative work. We would recommend logging in to Moodle almost every day to keep track of class discussions.  You will also need to set aside good chunks of time three or four times a week for undertaking course activities, doing the readings and keeping apace with the course work.
