The cultural and creative industries are an important area of study. The Cultural and Creative Industries described by UK government as the Creative Industries are those industries 'which have their origin in individual creativity, skill and talent and which have a potential for wealth and job creation through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property'. British fashion, architecture, publishing, craft and design, film and TV, video games and software, museums, theatre, dance, popular and classical music and visual arts are internationally recognized as world class. 1.7 million people work in these UK industries. Together they contribute almost Â£77bn in value added, equivalent to 5.0% of the UK economy. The latest DCMS estimates show that they grew by 9.9% in 2013, higher than any other sector. Allowing for the contribution of creative talent outside the creative industries, the creative economy's share may be approaching one-tenth of UK's economy. <br />
<br />
Behind all these figures and within all these industries there are complex creative people, practices and processes and this brings distinct challenges, organisationally and managerially. Within this course we explore these complexities practically and theoretically.</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    This course seeks to give students an understanding of the cultural, social and economic importance of creativity and the creative industries, and insights into the organisational and management practices within the cultural and creative industries, in addition to insights into creative lives and creative work processes.  The course will have invited guest speakers from creative organisations and institutions, as well as academic specialists in the field of cultural and creative industries. The reflective learning practices and innovative, empirically based assessments aim to develop your practice-based skills for your future careers. In so doing this course aims to provide practically applicable knowledge and skills for those seeking to work within the cultural and creative industries, and organisations more generally - the practices that have been common in organisations in the cultural and creative industries are increasingly of particular relevance more broadly as organisations in other sectors seek to be creative, focused on performance, flexibly organised, work across organisational boundaries and engaged with customers/service users. This practice-based work will be done in conjunction with theory based learning i.e. theories of management in the creative industries, creative process, artistic and organisational practice within the cultural and creative industries, in addition to cultural entrepreneurship and leadership. Thus the course aims to provide an understanding of managing and organising creativity by interlinking theory and practice. Mutually productive links between theory and practice will be forged through reading and class examination of academic and practitioner literature; interdisciplinary learning with ECA cohorts; detailed analysis of particular examples and contexts; and engagement with industry partners.<br />

Student Learning Experience:<br />
This course brings together practice and theoretical learning in a range of different ways, for example guest practitioner speakers and lecturers, research led teaching and the course assignments.<br />
<br />
Group Assignment (40% of the final mark)<br />
For the group project this year Creativity: Theory and Practice students will collaborate with ECA 4th year filmmakers to create a marketing and crowdfunding strategy for the 4th year filmmakers' films. CTP students will work with a filmmaker of their choosing throughout the semester to create their strategy. In week 11 CTP students will present their strategies to the Charlotte Gilmore (CTP) and Tracey Fearnehough (ECA). Groups are also expected to create a group webfolio documenting their group's creative processes. <br />
<br />
Individual assignment (60% of the final mark)<br />
For the individual assignment, students create an individual webfolio which each week they develop through reflections on the week's lecture and readings, this is then supported and illustrated by their creative resource section, which allows students to draw on any creative resources that they may wish to use for example, photos, soundclips, videos etc. The end submission is a reflective web based portfolio drawing together the student's experiences of the course and their own expressions of creativity.
