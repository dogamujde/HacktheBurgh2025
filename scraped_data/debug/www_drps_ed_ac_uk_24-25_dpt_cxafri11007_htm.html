<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">This course examines some of the key debates that displacement raises for students, researchers, and practitioners of development: How should the international community respond to refugee crises? What determines whether transnational diasporas are peace-makers or peace-breakers? Are distinctions between migrants due to poverty, those fleeing conflict, or those escaping natural disasters helpful or hurtful? Do labels like 'migrant', 'refugee','IDP', and 'asylum seekers' facilitate humanitarian protection or political containment? These questions examine the contentious relationship between approaches and 'solutions' to forced displacement and development, critically analysing and assessing both solutions and development  for whom, where, and with what (un)intended consequences?<br />
<br />
This course provides students with the necessary tools to frame their own nuanced, analytical answers to such questions. By examining key debates in forced migration studies, students learn to evaluate the dynamics of acute displacement as well as the policy responses that have helped shape the politics of 'migration management' in the greater context of international development. These skills and knowledge are imperative to a holistic understanding of international development and engagement with the discipline as theory, practice, and policy.<br />
<br />
These aims are pursued by dividing the course into three mutually reinforcing components. The first part provides an introduction to the basic concepts of the study of migration (categorisations of forcibly displaced people; the international legal framework and pertinent institutions; and the drivers of forced migration). The second part focuses on experiences of displacement (life in camps; journeys to countries of asylum; and protracted displacement situations). The third and final part examines durable solutions for refugees and their agency in these processes. <br />

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    Forced displacement has recently come to the forefront of popular debate in the guise of Europe's Refugee Crisis, enshrouded in anti-immigrant rhetoric concerning the spread of terrorism and insecurity. The study of forced migration, relatedly, has become vogue. This course aims to debunk the myths associated with these developments. It does so through a rigorous examination of displacement in context  as the prolonged and prevailing reality of 1 in 113 people across the world (UNHCR, 2016); and as a complex humanitarian crisis inextricable from approaches to and policies of international development. <br />
<br />
The course introduces students to the key theories and concepts needed to understand debates concerning current and continuing developments in displacement and development, and the contentious relationship between these topical disciplines. Students are challenged to engage critically with these academic and popular debates, using the tools and skills gained throughout the course to posit their own analyses and assessments in a rigorous and analytical manner. <br />
<br />
The course emphasizes the critical analysis of the nexus between displacement and development, examining approaches to basic concepts, refugee livelihoods, and durable solutions for refugees. In this vein, it is divided into three parts, each corresponding to these inter-related themes. The first part provides an introduction to the basic concepts of the study of migration (categorisations of forcibly displaced people; the international legal framework and pertinent institutions; and the drivers of forced migration). The second part focuses on experiences of displacement (life in camps; journeys to countries of asylum; and protracted displacement situations). The third and final part examines durable solutions for refugees and their agency in these processes. <br />
<br />
The ultimate objective of this course is to provide students with the necessary tools, skills, and knowledge to engage in a critical and informed manner with contemporary debates and developments concerning displacement and development as responsible citizens, researchers, activists, practitioners, and policy-makers.  <br />

<td colspan="14">Components of Assessment:<br />
Students will be assessed on three formal assignments, two of which are part of a formative assessment and feedback process, and the third which is summative:<br />
<br />
(i)	Participation in online discussion forums (10%); students will be marked according to (1) the frequency and consistency of their contributions as well as ; (2) the quality of their contributions (engagement with and reference to relevant readings, concepts, and theories; justified use of case studies and / or examples; critical assessment and analysis of key debates); and (3) commitment to fostering the on-line discussion community. Students are expected to demonstrate growth and improvement in the quality of their contributions throughout the course. Consideration will be given to students' diverse communication and learning styles, language skills, and mitigating circumstances as communicated to lecturers (competing professional responsibilities or unforeseen complications, for example). <br />
(ii)	Portfolio selection of at least two of the five online activities from the course and the essay plan (20%). If more than one activity is submitted, the final mark will be the average of the different activities. These activities are designed to help students develop their ideas; engage with and critically analyse key literatures and debates; and formulate and structure persuasive arguments grounded in theoretical and / or empirical evidence. Students will receive feedback on these assignments prior to the summative, final assignment to foster and augment their research, writing, and presentation skills. <br />
(iii)	A 3,000-word final essay (70%) based on the plan and feedback discussed above (ii). Due to temporal constraints, the course is incapable of covering all actors and sectors of international development. Thus, the final, summative evaluation is the student's own analysis of one particular actor and sector not covered explicitly in the course and its approach to international development. Students will be strongly encouraged to consider their topic / sector well in advance of writing their essay plans, so that they may integrate that focus into their online activities (for example, the info-graphic, mind-map, case study, etc.)<br />
