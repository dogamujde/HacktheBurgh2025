<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">This course will explore the literary afterlives of the decadent movement of the fin de siÃ¨cle. It will begin by considering late-nineteenth-century literary decadence, aestheticism, and cosmopolitanism, focusing in particular on the relationship between aesthetics, form, politics, and community in fin-de-siÃ¨cle anglophone literature. This work will then be used as a foundation to examine the way in which literary decadence was used by later writers in responding to some of the major crises and conflicts of the twentieth century.  <br />
<br />
Where decadence has tended to be represented as an individualistic aestheticized form of retreat, associated with a feminised, queer, or in other ways marginalised frivolity, this course will consider the ways in which writers from across the twentieth century harnessed and weaponised this very frivolity as a way of both interrogating and resisting racism, militarism, fascism, and misogyny. In particular, the course will address the ways in which decadence as form, touchstone, exemplar, and inspiration, offered writers resisting various modes of racial subordination, colonialism, and fascism a means of both formal literary resistance and identification with a transnational and transhistorical literary community.</td>

<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    While literary decadence is traditionally associated with endings of empires, civilisations, or centuries, this course instead takes the literary decadence of the end of the nineteenth century as its beginning. Students will consider the various ways in which writers throughout the twentieth century responded to, represented, and utilized decadent themes, tropes and forms in their own responses to crises, anxieties, and alienation. With a particular focus on the transatlantic anglophone afterlives of European literary decadence (in the UK, the US, and the Caribbean), the course will allow students to explore the relationship between literature and politics, as well as the transnational, transhistorical transmission of literary histories, themes, and forms. <br />
<br />
Beginning with a number of the foundational texts of literary decadence, including by Charles Baudelaire, Walter Pater, and Oscar Wilde, the course will first introduce students to decadence as a movement, in its historical, political, and cultural contexts. The course will then move through the twentieth century, from the First World War, the Harlem Renaissance, the late colonial Caribbean, and the rise of fascism in 1930s Europe, to the Second World War and its aftermath, the decline of the British empire, the AIDS crisis, and counter-cultural decadence in the 1970s, 1980s, and beyond. Students will read primary texts which, in various ways and modes, engage with decadence in their response to these historical events and phenomena, alongside a range of secondary reading placing these texts in both cultural and historical context, and will be asked to consider the different kinds of relationship between aesthetics, history, and social, sexual, and cultural politics which these texts offer. <br />
<br />
The course will complement and build on students existing knowledge of Victorian, Edwardian, modern, and contemporary literature, while also probing the usefulness of, and tensions and overlaps between, these terms. Possible readings will include well-known texts, such as Christopher Isherwood's Goodbye to Berlin (1939), Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited (1945), and Quentin Crisp's The Naked Civil Servant (1968), and these will be studied alongside lesser-known works, which might include texts such as Vernon Lee's The Ballet of the Nations (1915), the interwar poetry of Una Marson and W. Adolphe Roberts, and Neil Bartlett's Who Was That Man? A Present for Mr. Oscar Wilde (1988). Primary texts will potentially include novels, short stories, poetry, memoir, journalism, and drama. Students will also have the opportunity to discuss non-literary forms and modes of response to decadence, including art, music, film, and fashion. <br />
<br />
Seminars will be used to discuss the formal, aesthetic, political, and philosophical qualities of decadent literature, together with the social, sexual, cultural, and political contexts and commitments of the literature under discussion. In order to prepare for these seminars, students will be required to meet weekly in their small Autonomous Learning Groups (ALGs) to discuss the week's reading and to prepare materials for each seminar. These materials will be presented to the class in a range of formats (including written reports, formal verbal presentations, and informal contributions to class discussion). This course will be assessed through the completion of one 2,000-word coursework essay (30%) and one 3,000-word final essay (70%).

<td class="rowhead1" width="15%">Graduate Attributes and Skills</td>
<td width="85%">Students will be encouraged to think critically and with nuance about complex and challenging ideas, and to consider alternative perspectives through research and enquiry. <br />
<br />
Students will develop their skills in close reading, in historical and cultural contextualisation, and in crafting and substantiating nuanced and coherent written arguments about literary and cultural texts. They will also gain more experience in verbally presenting and debating specialised material with their peers and other specialists. <br />
<br />
Although working with guidance from the course leader, students will gain further experience of working in a self-motivated and independent fashion, and will be supported in seeking out further primary and secondary texts to develop their own areas of interest.</td>
