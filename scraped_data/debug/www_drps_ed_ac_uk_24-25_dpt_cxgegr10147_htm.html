The course will conceptually introduce students to Black Geographies, beginning from the global production of Blackness and Edinburgh's Black history, and then focus on key themes such as racial capitalism, Black ecologies, Black feminist embodiment, spatial poetics, abolition and repair, and Black practicing of plotting and commoning (marronage, etc.). To interrogate these topics in ways that attend to Black ways of knowing, the course will include text-based, visual, sound materials, and artistsÂ¿ works, draws on experiential practices, and includes a walking tour.<br />
<br />
Within this course, students will develop their own critical-creative practice at a selected Edinburgh site/display, to deploy Black Geographies approaches that presence Black history and Black life and demonstrate a reflection on their own positionality.<br />
<br />
The course will consist of weekly two-hour sessions of lecture and seminar, as well as tutorial sessions for students across the semester, and a two-hour external visit (walking tour).

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    This course provides a grounded introduction to key concepts and themes in Black Geographies. Black Geographies encompasses the ways that we understand the interdisciplinary nature of Black life through geographic frames, as well as refers to the expansion of geographic knowledge that takes place when we intentionally centre Black experiences, questions, and ways of knowing. This course draws on the myriad ways that Black life has been historically shaped and takes place in African and African diaspora contexts. The course interrogates the racial production of Blackness through the interrelated global projects of enslavement and colonisation, as well as attends to the continued creative, interdisciplinary production of Black life by peoples and in contexts racialised as Black.<br />
<br />
Recognising the City of Edinburgh's deep connections to enslavement and colonisation, the course engages Edinburgh as a situated location from which to learn, develop and apply Black geographic critiques. Students will critically interrogate and presence enslavement and colonial histories, and use Black spatial and social justice critiques, creative practices and interventions.<br />
<br />
The course proceeds in two parts:<br />
<br />
Part 1 will conceptually orient students to the production of Blackness and Black Geographies as a situated and critical approach. Lectures will provide an overview of key topic and ideas, seminars will operate as 'reading groups' where students bring their questions, reflections and responses to materials. Tutorial sessions will include, for example, a positionality reflection and workshop and walking tour of Edinburgh's Black History. These sessions will enable students to think about how we can approach Black Geographies from our different racialised positions, situate the course's Black Geographic focus within Edinburgh, and students will select one Edinburgh site or display (for example, a building, street, monument, etc.) for their focus within the course. The students will maintain the same one site over the course of the semester.<br />
<br />
Part 2 will cover selected topics in Black Geographies, students will apply their learnings to their selected site, and they will be supported to develop their own original critical-creative practices, which are grounded in a Black methodology, in their selected site. In seminar sessions, students will be supported to develop their understandings of each topic. Tutorial sessions will be designed around practical tasks to directly guide and support students progress and preparation. They will be supported to develop their understandings of each topic, and they will have the opportunity to apply their understandings to their selected Edinburgh sites (through tasks such as writing fieldnotes at their site, online research on their site's history, analysing examples of site-specific practices, experimenting and testing out selected spatial practices, etc.).<br />
<br />
The emphasis on students maintaining the same site is a pedagogical approach that directs them to develop a deep familiarity with their site through extended engagement and opportunity to use the site to work through course concepts, which will inform their site-specific practice. The students' work will be to presence the Black history of the site and then developing a critical-creative, site-specific practice in the site.<br />

In this tutorial workshop, students critically unpack their positionalities and how it orients their engagement with Blackness and Black Geographies.<br />
<br />
Three summatibe assessments will be linked to the studentÂ¿s selection of one Edinburgh site connected to the city's enslavement, colonial, and wider Black history:<br />
<br />
Selected Site/Display Essay (30%): Word count: 1000 words. The essay will presence the site's connections to enslavement, colonisation, or other aspects of Black histories, alongside a positionality reflection and the student's relation to the site. <br />
<br />
Student Project Presentation (Formative Assessment): Students submit a 5-minute recorded presentation on developing site-specific practice, and then provide peer-to-peer feedback to two student colleagues.<br />
<br />
Student shares their intended practice, explaining how the practice is site-specific, outlining the Black geographic methodology they intend to use, and how it responds to the politics of their site, with visual/sound/performed/written example from initial research.<br />
<br />
Site-Specific Practice Essay (70%): Word count: 2500 words.Student presents their critical-creative and <br />
 site-specific practice, they provide evidences of activity (fieldnotes, images, recording etc), they critically analyze how their practice deploys a Black methodology, and they reflect on their experience developing their practice from their positionality and from Edinburgh as a Black geographic location.<br />
