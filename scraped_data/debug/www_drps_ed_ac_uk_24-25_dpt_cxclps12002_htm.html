Trainees will gather experience of engagement, assessment, formulation, intervention and evaluation across a range of psychological problems, typically including, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and the effects of trauma. Trainees will be expected to use and develop a significant range of the competencies associated with working as a psychologist in adult mental health services. As is typical of psychological therapy, trainees will be expected to deal with complex issues and make informed judgements, considering multiple sources of information, which may sometimes be incomplete. Trainees will be expected to form appropriate professional relationships with colleagues and clients / patients. Trainees will be expected to work from a professional code of ethics and to interpret and apply this. Trainees will also be expected to work from the evidence base, using practices based on research evidence and to engage in reflection through regular supervision of practice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    a) Academic Description <br />
 <br />
The placement will take place in NHS settings under the supervision of a Clinical Psychologist. There may be situations where trainees are supervised by more than one supervisor or by other Applied Psychologist(s) (e.g. Counselling, Forensic) or by members of other professions according to the Programme Eligibility criteria for supervisor which are found in the NHS and Clinical Practice Placements Handbook. In the remainder of this text the word supervisor denotes supervisor(s). <br />
 <br />
The placement will be scheduled to last a minimum of 5-6 months and trainees will be on placement for 4 days each week apart from weeks when they have teaching (see Handbook for details). During the placement, trainees are required to demonstrate principles of work relevant to clinical psychology practice and the application of evidence-based practice governed by psychological models and concepts. During Adult Mental health placement, trainees will have 1 study day per week apart from weeks when they are receiving teaching (see Handbook for details). This time is for reading and study relating to placement as well as relating to any academic coursework. <br />
 <br />
b) Outline Content <br />
 <br />
Trainees will see a range of clients of working age for psychological therapy. The range of problems may include phobias, OCD, PTSD or other post-trauma work including childhood abuse, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, psychosis, complex bereavement, psychosexual problems and interpersonal/relationship problems. Trainees can expect to experience cases involving assessment of presenting problems, leading to formulation and treatment plans, direct treatment with clients with whom the trainee is the prime worker, indirect work with clients e.g. advising staff or relatives, development of skills in interviewing, formulation/treatment and use of and interpretation of relevant testing/questionnaire material, including neuropsychological assessment where possible. Trainees will gain experience of cognitive behavioural techniques. Where possible, they should also have the opportunity to participate in teamwork. During the placement, trainees are expected to have a range of experiences and client contacts, such that they are able to demonstrate competencies in the application of psychological theory to practice relevant to this population. All trainees are to complete client feedback questionnaires with at least two clients per placement and a session-by-session feedback questionnaire on client experience with at least one client during training. <br />
 <br />
c) Student Learning Experience <br />
 <br />
Trainees will be on placement in NHS settings working clinically with clients/patients. These placements are frequently within NHS adult psychology services, though a wide range of other service settings may be encountered, such as community mental health teams, in patient mental health settings or other services for people with psychological disorder. The placement may take place across different locations or services. Trainees will receive regular supervision from their supervisor(s) in line with guidance from the professional/accrediting bodies, in addition to other informal contact and input, sometimes from other psychologists or team members. Trainees can expect to observe their supervisor(s) on at least 5 occasions during the placement. Trainees are expected to be observed on at least 5 occasions by their supervisor(s) during the placement, in order to receive feedback on their performance and for the supervisor to be able to evaluate their progress towards their standard and personalised learning objectives and implementation of agreed changes. It is expected that the supervisor(s) will use the Cognitive Therapy Scale - Revised (CTS-R) as a structured assessment of competence to provide formative feedback on at least 3 of these observations of the trainee.

<td class="rowhead1" stlye="width:15%;">Feedback</td>
<td colspan="14">Formative feedback is given on an ongoing basis as part of regular supervision and case discussion. It is also given after the trainee is observed by the supervisor, whether by sitting in with a trainee's session or by using a video or audio recording of a session. As described above, for some observations, the supervisor is expected to use the CTS-R to provide the trainee with specific formative feedback on their CBT competences. Detailed formative feedback is given prior to the mid-placement visit, when the supervisor completes the Evaluation of Clinical competence (ECC) Form. The supervisor discusses this with the trainee in advance of the mid-placement visit. During the mid-placement visit, the ECC is discussed with the trainee and the supervisor by the mid-placement visitor. <br />
 <br />
Summative feedback is provided at the end of placement by the supervisor completing the ECC form, to make a recommendation regarding the placement grade, and this is discussed with the trainee. The ECC form and other placement documentation are reviewed at the End of Placement meeting or Joint Annual Review where the decision is made on the placement grade that will be submitted to the Board of Examiners . <br />
 <br />
Please refer to Section 3 of the NHS and Clinical Practice Placement Handbook for full guidance on mid-placement visits, End of Placement meetings and Joint Annual Reviews.</td>
