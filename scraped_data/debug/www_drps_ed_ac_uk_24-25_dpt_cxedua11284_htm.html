Focus of the course units is on the knowledge base of second language teachers and how we, as second language teacher educators, can help teachers learn this knowledge. <br />
<br />
It is desirable to have had some relevant experience of TESOL teacher education, although this is not a specific requirement of entry to the course. An immediate outcome of this course will be ideas and understanding, at the level of both theory and practice, of ways of managing innovation and change in teachers' professional classroom practice. Students may wish to develop these ideas further as part of their dissertation.</td>

    We will consider what it means to know a second language and what it means to know how to teach a second language. <br />
There are four interrelated themes: <br />
-	the knowledge base of second language teaching<br />
-	second language teacher identity<br />
-	reflective learning<br />
-	language and critical pedagogy.Indicative content<br />
<br />
Block 1 (lectures 1-3): introduction to the 4 themes; the knowledge base of second language teachers; knowledge and knowing; the relation between teacher knowledge and teacher identity.<br />
<br />
Block 2 (lecture 4): reflective writing and practice for teacher development<br />
<br />
Block 3 (lectures 5-6): observing teaching; teacher training and education<br />
<br />
Block 4 (lectures 7-8): action research for continuing professional development; putting it altogether - I am a critical language teacher educator who promotes reflective practice on a complex but clearly expressed knowledge base.<br />

<td colspan="14">Assessment<br />
1. Formative assignment<br />
Paired writing task. This assignment is not graded.<br />
<br />
Students will work with a Critical Friend and look at their journal entries for weeks 1-4. <br />
Together, they write one short  (500-600 word) reflective essay in which they:<br />
-	describe an aspect of their learning <br />
-	analyse what is changing, or has changed, in their thinking about teacher education<br />
-	relate this to a context or contexts with which they are familiar. <br />
<br />
Students are encouraged do this with their Critical Friend because the process of writing together involves saying out loud what they are thinking and having to collaborate to reach a shared understanding helping both of them to sort out what they actually believe. It is easier if students agree on the same aspect of their learning (e.g. the concept of the teacher's knowledge base). The writing will perhaps include a comparison how each student feels their thinking is changing. Examples from the journals should be used to support the claims that are made.<br />
<br />
References to the relevant academic literature should be included (minimum 3, maximum 10).<br />
<br />
Note: This assignment is formative: it practices the skills needed for the Critical Review of Reflective Journal essay (Part 1) of the course assessment.<br />
<br />
2. Final assignment<br />
This assignment is in two parts. <br />
<br />
Part 1.<br />
Part 1 is based on the reflective journal* which you will write every week during the course.<br />
You are required to write a critical review of the way your ideas about teaching and teacher learning, and your own reflective writing, have developed over the course. You should use the journal entries as data which you can include in the assignment as evidence. This part of the assessment is particularly relevant for <br />
<br />
(*The reflective journal is a place for writing about any topics or issues which interest you as a result of studying the Second Language Teacher Education course. You may wish to discuss topics that have reinforced, influenced or changed your ideas on teaching and the training of other teachers. You may also wish to write about your practical experiences in the classroom, or within teacher education contexts, and show how these relate to theory.  These reflections must be supported with the relevant literature that is discussed on a weekly basis during the course. You are encouraged to develop your writing to be more than just descriptive so that you begin to ask questions about SLTE and discuss possible answers as you write down your thoughts. In your writing about specific ideas, you are also encouraged to think about the wider social context in which second language teachers work.<br />
You are required to write your journal reflections on a facility set up by the course tutor on LEARN.  The journal is a public document which can be seen by class members and tutors. This means that the content of the journal needs to be appropriate and follow professional standards.  You are required to post weekly comments on the reflections of two other class members in order to facilitate a critical reflective process.  Tutors on the course will comment twice on each student's journal.)<br />
1200 words*. This part is worth 30% of the total.<br />
This part relates to Learning Outcomes 3 and 4.<br />
<br />
Part 2.<br />
Part 2 requires you to plan and critically evaluate a proposal for SLTE in a second language teaching context with which you are familiar. The proposal is not for a single training session but rather an appropriate programme of SLTE to meet some needs that you have identified. The decisions you make should be based on current theory of SLTE. Your paper will show that you know what is considered important for teachers to learn and how teachers are thought to learn.<br />
You should make clear how your practical activities are applying the theory. In your writing, there should be a balance theory and practice and you will support your ideas with references to relevant literature.<br />
<br />
You should describe the context (in which you have been a teacher or a learner).<br />
You should identify the content of the SLTE you propose and explain what is to be included and why it is relevant and necessary.<br />
You should explain how the SLTE will take place (e.g. the time period, the type of activities the teacher educator and teacher-learners will take part in, how you will evaluate the SLTE). You should justify your ideas with reference to theory about how teachers learn. You should indicate what you think are the strengths and possible weaknesses in you plan.<br />
<br />
2,800 words**. This part is worth 70% of the total. This part of the assessment relates to Learning Outcomes 1, 2 and 5.<br />
**References are not part of the word count.<br />
