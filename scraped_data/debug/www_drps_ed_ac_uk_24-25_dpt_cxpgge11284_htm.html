<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    This course builds on Foundations in Ecological Economics. The purpose of the course is to facilitate students in acquiring deeper, specialist knowledge about topic areas within Ecological Economics in which they are interested. Because the course is focused on creating opportunities for students to pursue their own interests, much of the content of this course will be either student-led or come from a process of co-creation with staff. There will also be formal elements of peer/self-review. Thus, students who pursue this course should have clear interests in Ecological Economics, a high degree of self-motivation, and a collaborative spirit.  <br />
 <br />
Students will receive training in evidence synthesis, and will then design, conduct, and write up a review on a topic area of their own choosing within Ecological Economics. The methodological training will equip students with a skill that is useful much more broadly than this course (including in research and post-MSc employment). The result of the review will be a much deeper understanding of one part of Ecological Economics as a discipline. <br />
 <br />
Students will also receive training and guidance in designing and delivering workshops (focused, specifically, on educational and knowledge exchange workshops). Students will act on this training by designing and delivering a workshop to educate their peers on the outcomes of their review.  <br />
 <br />
Finally, students will reflect on what they have learned from their peersÂ¿ workshops, and how this expands up and refines the foundational Ecological Economics knowledge they gained in semester 1.  <br />
 <br />
The course will be conducted primarily using a flipped-classroom, which means students will need to prepare in specific ways (e.g. by completing readings and pre-recorded lectures) prior to coming to class.  <br />
 <br />
In the first 7 weeks, class time will be spent advancing, and getting feedback on studentsÂ¿ evidence synthesis pieces. Feedback will come from both staff and students. The remaining weeks of class will be focused on the design and delivery of the workshops (where, again, feedback will come from both students and staff).  <br />
 <br />
Following the completing of class-based activities, students will have a period to reflect, synthetically, on their learning.

<td class="rowhead1" stlye="width:15%;">Additional Information (Assessment)</td>
<td colspan="14">There are three components to the assessment in this course: <br />
 <br />
Written Evidence Synthesis  <br />
(5,000 words max - 50%) <br />
<br />
Workshop Design &amp; Delivery <br />
(2,500 words max - 25%) <br />
 <br />
Self-Reflection  <br />
(2,500 words max - 25%) <br />
 <br />
The written evidence synthesis pertains directly to LO1 and LO2. Students will propose a question they want answered within a topic area of Ecological Economics in which they are interested. They will <br />
- select a style of evidence synthesis (e.g. rapid evidence assessment, systematic map, etc.) to conduct <br />
- design a protocol to enable them to answer their question <br />
- conduct the review <br />
- write the review <br />
<br />
Through this process they will acquire experience and skills in conducting evidence synthesis, and deepen their academic knowledge of Ecological Economics. <br />
<br />
They will then design a workshop that will enable them to teach the others in the class what it is they have learned through their evidence synthesis. This relates directly to LO3.  <br />
<br />
They will be assessed on a combination of the following: <br />
<br />
A written piece that explains the objectives for their session, their design, and the reasons for it <br />
<br />
The delivery of the session <br />
<br />
The mark will come in part from staff assessment, and part from peer/self-assessment. In line with the theme of student-led, co-creation of the course, the exact ratio of staff to student evaluation will be determined within the class itself. Students will contribute a maximum of 40% of the mark for the second assessment (i.e. a max of 10% of the overall course mark).  <br />
<br />
The final component of the assessment is a piece of reflective writing in which students reflect on 1) the most important things learned about Ecological Economics from the sessions presented by other students in their workshops and 2) how this connects to the foundational knowledge gained in semester 1. This directly relates to LO1, and is important to help students consolidate what they have learned in this course with what they have learned in Foundations in Ecological Economics in semester 1  <br />
<br />
Note: The first two assignments may, in some years and for some students, be completed by teams of students. The final assignment will always be individual. Whenever students work in teams, any team-based marks will be individualized using a process of qualitative peer/self-review derived from Team-Based Learning, and which has been used extensively within the Ecological Economics programme over the past 5 years.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" stlye="width:15%;">Feedback</td>
<td colspan="14">Much of the class time will be spent on the task of formative feedback using an approach similar to mentoring or supervision).  <br />
 <br />
In the first part of the course, core lecture content will be delivered almost exclusively through pre-recorded lectures, and will be assigned as preparation for class. Students will be given milestones to help ensure they are progressing through their reviews. Students will be asked each week to share updates on their progress within the class. Each person will get feedback on that progress. Both students and staff will be involved in giving this feedback, but the balance between staff/student feedback, and the level of detail will depend to a large extent on how many people are in the course.  The structure for class time will also depend on numbers.  <br />
 <br />
In the second part of the course, students will get individual feedback from staff on their ideas for how to deliver their workshop teaching their peers about the outcome of their reviews. Depending on numbers, they may also get feedback from their peers at this stage. Several weeks of class time will be allocated to these workshops themselves.  <br />
 <br />
Feedback on the summative elements of the course will come from staff (for all three assessments), and from peer/self-review (for the workshop themselves).</td>

These will pertain to approaches/methods for conducting evidence synthesis and the design and delivery of workshops. <br />
