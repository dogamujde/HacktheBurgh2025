<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">This course uses the Student-Led Individually Created Course (SLICC) university-wide framework for self-designed experiential learning.  It offers a highly flexible yet supported approach, where students develop their own defined experience or series of related activities and experiences with a theme, to address their own specific academic and professional demands. Students reflect regularly and throughout their defined experience, specifically by reflective blogging, which they collect and curate as a reflective e-portfolio, to provide evidence of their learning. <br />
<br />
As a participating student, undertaking a SLICC will enable you to create a learning experience which is unique to you and your own needs and academic and professional aims.  You will demonstrate your learning and academic achievement against learning outcomes in a defined experiential learning and assessment framework.<br />
<br />
This course will require you to demonstrate the development of your skills and understanding in terms of critical analysis, application, self-reflection, recognising and developing your skills and mindsets, and evaluation within the context of the learning experience you have defined. This course will also enable you to demonstrate your ability to exercise autonomy and initiative, and deal with challenges that may present themselves in an academic subject/discipline (or other approved) area, and/or at an applied professional level in practice.<br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    A SLICC requires you to propose, develop and manage your own learning experience within a supported learning and assessment framework that will enable you to evidence how you have achieved the learning outcomes of the course.  It offers you autonomy and flexibility to address your own learning requirements, and academic and professional needs.<br />
<br />
Your self-designed learning experience is required to adhere to a defined learning and assessment framework that supports and enables you to self-direct and manage your own learning experience. Within this structure however, you have real autonomy and flexibility regarding the topic or theme, content of study and nature of your experience, provided your proposal is academically feasible, and is approved by your tutor.<br />
<br />
Your SLICC may, for example, be based upon a particular extra-curricular learning opportunity such as an internship, work experience, pro-bono activity, community engagement, volunteering, study-abroad or indeed may be entirely self-directed. In agreement with your own programme, your SLICC could also be based on your wider co-curricular range of activities in which you engage to support your main course of study, and how these contribute to your wider development.  These may include your learning and its usage and application, from what would otherwise be co- or extra-curricular activities.   It may focus on a theme of professional and /or personal interest such as sustainability, social responsibility, external engagement, equality and cultural diversity, or a disciplinary or interdisciplinary-based research theme or application.<br />
<br />
This course can enable flexibility in course delivery and curriculum design for students in their postgraduate programme.  By way of examples, students may be working on interdisciplinary activities, in groups from different years of study.  Activities may be exploring 'wicked' or global problems, where there is a risk of achieving a perceived successful outcome, if that is defined as a project report. <br />
<br />
The steps in undertaking a SLICC are as follows:<br />
1) Identify a suitable opportunity within which to undertake your learning experience<br />
2) Write your draft proposal and submit to your tutor/advisor for approval<br />
3) Self-direct and manage your own learning experience, as detailed within the framework<br />
4) Actively and regularly reflect upon and document your experience with evidence and use that as a basis for writing your self-critical 'Interim Reflective Report', then your 'Final Reflective Report'<br />
5) Formatively self-assess and submit your 'Final Reflective Report' for summative assessment by your tutor.<br />
<br />
The steps identified above each require a significant amount of thought and input and will ultimately form part of a 'time-based' e-portfolio of reflective evidence, which you will curate and use in the assessment of your SLICC.<br />
<br />
Undertaking a SLICC you will not only develop the content of your learning experience but also produce an agreed portfolio of outputs.  You must evidence what you have learned and, importantly, where you demonstrate how you have met the learning outcomes for the course.<br />

The 'Interim Reflective Report' is in the same format as the 'Final Reflective Report', so this formative feedback aligns directly with the final summative assessment, to enable you to improve and develop you assessed submission.<br />
You will also be asked to offer a 'self-assessment' using the SLICC marking criteria and rubric, to help you develop your assessment literacy.<br />

<td class="rowhead1" width="15%">Graduate Attributes and Skills</td>
<td width="85%">Undertaking a SLICC will enable each student to develop their abilities in self-critical reflection, organisation and time-management, self-assessment, evaluation of standards and competencies achieved, application of prior learning in a defined context, and provide opportunities to further develop analytical and presentation skills. The SLICC learning outcomes are derived from and embedded in the institutional 'Graduate Attributes' (https://www.ed.ac.uk/graduate-attributes). The learning outcomes are flexible to provide students with autonomy. With guidance from your assigned academic tutor, this flexibility of choice enables you, in the context of your own chosen experience, to focus on your own particular 'skills' (Learning Outcome 3) and 'mindsets' (Learning Outcome 4). You can select the specific attributes that you consider are the most important to reflect upon, looking into your current and future professional and personal aims and career aspirations.</td>
