The aims of this course are achieved through core themes related to: curriculum; learning and teaching; research, equalities, diversity, values, sustainability and teacher identity.  <br />
<br />
This course prepares student teachers in pedagogical and curricular learning, as well as providing opportunities for professional development, necessary for the delivery of high quality Expressive Arts or Physical Education provision within the Scottish primary school sector, in line with the GTCS Standards for Provisional Registration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    A range of effective pedagogies, strategies, structures and techniques are considered, investigated and critically analysed through practical, activity based workshops. Students learn through cognitive apprenticeship, social pedagogy and experiential learning methodologies, exploring ideas and approaches to teaching, learning and assessment from both the perspective of the pupil and of the teacher. Models of effective practice are experienced and explored practically, before being deconstructed and critically investigated in terms of related pedagogical theories, method, strengths and potential issues in practice. The approaches outlined here exemplify a core commitment to reflective and reflexive praxis, where the values that underpin how, why and what we teach inform our actions.  This helps student teachers to broaden their pedagogic understanding from being solely classroom based, and to extend to include aspects of citizenship and belonging in the wider community.  Students are therefore supported in closing the gap between what they value and how they act in the world.<br />
<br />
In addition, students' critical engagement with a wide range of relevant academic literature, educational policy and legislation, analysed within their sociopolitical/historical contexts, underpins this experience. Subsequent critical analysis, through the employment of a range of theoretical perspectives helps student teachers to analyse and evaluate pedagogical approaches that can be refined and adapted to work effectively within a primary setting and context.  <br />
<br />
Ideally, the course will include a brief primary school experience, if available. This experience takes place either during Block Placement 1or 2. Experience of working within the primary school introduces students to the potential of becoming a peripatetic, specialist teacher working within the primary sector.
