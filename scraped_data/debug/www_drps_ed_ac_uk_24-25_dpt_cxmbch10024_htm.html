It equips students with a solid foundation in the generalities of medical practice.  Most of the knowledge-based curriculum will be presented online.  Clinical experience will be gained through placements in a variety of secondary care settings as well as three sessions per week in general practice.  <br />
The course covers the fundamentals of how patients present, how the clinical team works, communication and consultation skills, and how clinical management is determined and implemented by healthcare teams, in partnership with the patient and their carers.<br />
<br />
In hospital and primary care settings, students will put into practice the foundational knowledge and skills developed in HCP-Med: Foundations of Medicine 1 and 2.  They will assess patients by taking clinical histories and clinical examination, they will propose and interpret investigations and formulate clinical management plans. The course emphasises  a holistic, patient-centred approach, which recognises and addresses the physical, social and psychological dimensions of illness and wellbeing.  <br />

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    HCP-Med: Process of Care 1 consists of 40 weeks of teaching and comprises three residential weeks, each of which include 41 hours of student effort.  The remaining 37 weeks of include online teaching and time in clinical placements.  The online/clinical weeks each involve 21 hours of student effort. <br />
<br />
Teaching and learning includes the following approaches:<br />
Online teaching has two broad aims: <br />
(i) To present high quality resources which engage and challenge students and <br />
(ii) To create and support a community of learning.  <br />
<br />
A range of teaching methods will be used:<br />
	- Each module will start with a video introduction, including the learning outcomes<br />
	- Pre-recorded narrated lectures, with slides which will cover the main learning points<br />
	- Discussion boards will be used for both general discussion and specific tasks<br />
	- Students will monitor their learning through frequent online quizzes<br />
	- Virtual tutorials will use problem-based or case-based learning<br />
	- Students will be provided with links to curated online resources<br />
<br />
Residential weeks will include lectures, tutorials, group-work, workshops for communication skills and clinical skills, and practical demonstrations for anatomy.<br />
General practices placements will use a variety of teaching methods: <br />
(i) apprentice-style observation of surgeries, which will provide early exposure to a wide range of clinical cases and allow ad-hoc discussion of cases relevant to the online curriculum; <br />
(ii) tutorials covering aspects of professional knowledge, skills and behaviours to complement online teaching; and <br />
(iii) shadowing members of the primary care team to reinforce online teaching. <br />
<br />
Other clinical placements will include teaching in outpatient clinics, wards, operating theatres, and sessions to learn about imaging and the work of investigative laboratories.  <br />
<br />
Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to develop self-directed learning,  This will pose a challenge for the students and they will be supported in this approach.  Clear guidance will be given so that students can prioritise their reading.  Self-directed learning will be supplemented by interactive tutorials, online and often in clinical settings.  <br />

<td colspan="14">Knowledge-based assessment<br />
Students will sit a maximum of four papers. Each paper consists of 80 items, with approximately 90% SBA and 10% VSAQ. All papers utilise the same blueprint, meaning you will be tested on concepts that you may not have had formal teaching on, particularly in the early papers. However, you will have encountered the principles of these concepts during Years 1 &amp; 2. This counts as 70% of the course overall mark.<br />
<br />
Practical exam<br />
The OSCE will consist of 10 stations<br />
Students who have not achieved the pass score plus 1 standard error of the estimate or have not passed Â»50% of stations will take the sequential test of a further 8 stations. Students will need to achieve the pass score AND pass Â» 50% of stations to pass the OSCE. <br />
Students who fail following the Sequential OSCE will be offered a resit of Year 3 as a second sitting. This counts as 30% of the course overall mark.<br />
<br />
Clinical portfolio<br />
A Clinical workbook will be used for placement requirements and sign off, clinical skills and all other requirements. It is expected that sign offs should be performed by colleagues representing the entire range of seniority, this should include consultant / GP and registrars as well as FY<br />
All requirements will need to be completed to progress. This includes submission of case base discussions. <br />
<br />
Professionalism is monitored throughout the year focusing on the four GMC domains of professionalism:<br />
1.	Knowledge, skills and performance<br />
2.	Safety and quality<br />
3.	Communication, partnership and teamwork<br />
4.	Maintaining trust<br />
<br />
Clinical Portfolio and Professionalism must be passed in order to progress but will not contribute to the total mark for the course.<br />
