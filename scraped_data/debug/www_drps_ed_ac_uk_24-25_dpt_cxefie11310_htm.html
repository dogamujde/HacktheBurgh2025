<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">This is a course for students who want to learn about technology start up thinking,  innovation and entrepreneurship. The course is an introduction for students with early-stage start up ideas, or who are just at the beginning of that ideation process. The course focuses on three key things: helping you turn an idea into a sustainable business; breaking down barriers to the start up world by demystifying the jargon around tech entrepreneurship; and sharing toolkits and frameworks of product and service innovation to give students the power to respond to fast change and cultivate resilience in a turbulent world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    The course will introduce the principles of startup culture through a series of pre-recorded videos from CodeBase member companies and entrepreneurs that have been on the startup journey, articles and other resources.  Students will form teams to introduce the Challenge Theme.  <br />
<br />
Teams will work to explore an opportunity for social innovation.  Discussion boards will be available to help students demystify the jargon used and get you ready for the intensive study period.      <br />
<br />
The intensive study period will be delivered in fusion form, with students remaining in their teams. The sessions will pursue four core concepts:<br />
<br />
1) Intro to Startups: This introductory lecture will cover what role startups play in modern economies, how they innovate, what makes them different to other organisations, why most of them fail, and why startup careers have become so viable in the last 30 years. In the workshop section students will focus on defining a 'good' problem, which they will focus on for the rest of the intensive, to explore a social innovation opportunity within the course Challenge Theme.<br />
<br />
2) Understanding Markets: Introductory lecture on markets and market research, followed by a challenge-based exercise in defining a social innovation opportunity. <br />
<br />
3) Product Discovery will be introduced with a situated example and lecture exploring Jobs-to-Be-Done theory and customer interviewing techniques, followed by group exercises in lean experimentation methods to test business ideas with real customers.  <br />
<br />
4) Business Models and Pitching will be covered by a lecture followed by an introduction to the role of pitching and Pitch Decks. Teams will work on exploring their business model on one sheet of paper and develop storytelling skills, becoming ready to pitch their hypothetical idea to a variety of stakeholders. <br />
<br />
Following the intensive study periid, individuals in each team will choose one particular aspect of the core concepts: markets, product discovery or business models and pitching. Each student will carry out some practical work relating to their chosen concept and develop a response that demonstrates insight and understanding.   <br />
                 <br />

<br />
Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:<br />
<br />
The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities.<br />
<br />
Students should be aware that:<br />
- Classrooms used in this course will have additional technology in place: students might not be able to sit in areas away from microphones or outside the field of view of all cameras.<br />
- Unless the lecturer or tutor indicates otherwise you should assume the session is being recorded.<br />
<br />
As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.

Feedback on the summative assessment will be provided in written form via Learn, the University of Edinburgh's Virtual Learning Environment (VLE).<br />
<br />
Following the presentation of the pitch decks at the end of each intensive day, tutors and peers will provide instant feedback     that highlight strengths and weaknesses in the ideas.<br />
<br />
Groups will be formed around each of the core concepts associated with the development of new products and services: markets, Jobs To Be Done, Build-Measure-Learn and business models/ investment. These groups will provide peer support and feedback toward the production of the final individual summative submission.</td>
