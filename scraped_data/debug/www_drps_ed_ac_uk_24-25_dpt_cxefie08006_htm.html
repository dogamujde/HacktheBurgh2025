<br />
Please Note:<br />
This course is only available to students enrolled on the Edinburgh Futures Institute's undergraduate programme Interdisciplinary Futures (MA) degree.<br />
<br />
This course will allow you to develop further practice and confidence in your work as a change agent. You will gain deep insight into a complex problem linked to one of our global challenge themes through work on a 'real world' issue faced by one of our external partners (the exact challenge statement will be confirmed shortly before the semester starts). Put your research, teamworking and problem-solving skills to use and make your learning benefit local communities!</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    In EFI Change Agents, you will practice and deepen your skills in research, team working and problem solving developed in your first year of study, whilst exploring a new topic and gaining deep knowledge and insight into a different complex set of problems. <br />
<br />
You will work in a small team of students to explore a challenge that has been proposed by an external partner and produce a set of outputs and recommendations that will help the external develop a solution for the problem. The problem statement that you and your team will be working on is linked to one of our overarching global challenge themes (e.g., sustainability, global health, inequality, conflict), and you will have access to a range of resources, which may include reading material, lectures (live or recorded), panel discussions and workshops, allowing you to develop a deeper understanding of this year's challenge theme. This will provide a useful broader context for the problem statement negotiated with the external partner, helping you to make the link between wider global issues and their manifestations at local level. <br />
<br />
The overarching theme and exact challenge statement will change year on year; examples from similar projects in previous years include topics such as 'How can the mental health of children living in Scotland be improved?', 'How can more sustainable tourism be encouraged in Edinburgh?', or 'How might we reduce food waste in cafeterias?'<br />
<br />
Throughout the course, you will use and further build on the skills in creative problem solving that you have developed in first year, and you will apply your knowledge and understanding of different methods of academic enquiry and analysis developed through 'Researching Global Challenges 1 and 2'; this includes researching and analysing different types of data (including numerical and digital data) and considering the ethical dimensions of working with data. A main focus of EFI Change Agents will be the further development of effective team working skills, including work on addressing the problems that arise when collaborating in diverse groups.<br />
<br />
The semester will start with a general introduction to the course and the challenge area, and you will get to know your team and work on a team charter to help you set your goals and build the foundations for successful collaboration. Early on, the external partner will be present to provide some context to the challenge from their point of view, and you will have opportunity to negotiate the exact focus of the problem statement before you start your research and, subsequently, the idea generation phase of the course. Compared to first year, you will be given greater agency in your research and choice of methods for problem solving, encouraging you and your team to work at a higher level of independence. You will be supported in your work by group coaches whom you will meet in fortnightly sessions to discuss your team's progress and any problems you may encounter. At a session half-way through the course, all teams will be given the opportunity to present their thinking so far and receive feedback on the plans for their projects. <br />
<br />
The final output will be presented to the external partner at the end of the course. Teams will have a choice in selecting a format for their final output, appropriate to their project's aims and approach (e.g., business-style report, process map, prototype with implementation plan). In addition to the group output, each student will submit an individual reflective piece to capture the learning on the challenge area, the process of responding to complex problems as member of a diverse team, and the individual contribution to the group project. The group output and the individual reflection together make up the assessment for the course (pass/fail, with both components having to be passed).

<td colspan="14">The course will be assessed on a pass/fail basis.<br />
<br />
This means that no numerical marks will be given. The assessment is on coursework only, there is no exam.<br />
<br />
There are two components of assessment:<br />
<br />
Both components must be passed.<br />
<br />
1) Group Assignment (Pass/Fail)<br />
<br />
Groups will communicate the results of their project in a format that is appropriate for the approach they have taken and that is of value to the external partner. They will select from a choice of formats which may include: <br />
<br />
a) A written business style report of no more than 3,000 words and including some visuals that describes the approach to the challenge, the data and methodology used, the results of the data analysis and the recommendations based on these results; or <br />
<br />
b) A process map with accompanying guidance; or<br />
<br />
c) Web content of no more than 3,000 words and including a selection of appropriate visuals and links; or<br />
<br />
d) The outline of a (social) media campaign.<br />
<br />
Other formats for the group output can be agreed by groups in negotiation with the external partner and the course organiser. Whatever output is chosen needs to evidence the approach to the challenge, the data and methodology used, the results of the data analysis and how the output draws on these results. The group assignment will be assessed on the quality of data analysis, the level of critical awareness of the challenge in wider contexts, the clarity and appropriateness of the language and visuals used to communicate the ideas, and on technical quality. <br />
<br />
(LOs 1, 3, 4 and 5)<br />
<br />
The group assignment will be submitted for assessment by one student on behalf of the whole group, and all students on the group will receive the same result (pass or fail). The submission will be via Learn in week 11 of semester 2. At that stage, the output will also be presented to the external organisation that has set the challenge, both in writing and in a presentation.<br />
<br />
B) Individual Reflection (Pass/Fail)<br />
<br />
Each student will produce an individual reflection on their learning process and how their research, knowledge and skills set has contributed to the group project. It will be assessed on the depth and quality of the reflection - including critical evaluation of the individual's contribution to the group output - as well as on structure and clarity of language. The reflection will be 1000 words long. <br />
<br />
(LOs 1, 2 and 4)</td>

<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" stlye="width:15%;">Feedback</td>
<td colspan="14">Students will receive verbal feedback from both staff and their peers on their contribution to the group projects throughout the course. Groups will receive feedback on their project plans in a formative assessment and feedback event halfway through the course (in week 11 of semester 1 and/or week 2 of semester 2), in preparation of the more detailed work in the second part of the course. <br />
<br />
Students will receive written feedback on both their group projects and their individual reflections within 15 working days after submission.</td>
