Students will be introduced to a range of acrylic painting approaches including preparing painting surfaces, mark-making and colour theory. Students are guided through their development of ideas to create resolved paintings which show a coherency. The course is designed to encourage a more independent approach from the students and to steer further development of their art practice.</td>

<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    1) Academic Description<br />
 The aim of this course is for students to understand and practise ways of transferring ideas and visual research into a series of personally ambitious and compelling paintings. The course investigates several ways of making these steps including ways of recording visual information in a sketchbook, how to investigate the paintings of other artists, exploring ways of applying paint, and implementing colour theory, composition and tonal design.<br />
 The course is practical in nature with the emphasis on painting. The immersive nature of the course will provide an in-depth understanding of the iterative and experimental nature of creative practice as well as the practicalities of translating ideas developed in a sketchbook into resolved outcomes. To complement this there will be demonstrations of sketchbook use, mind-mapping and colour theory. There will also be frequent referrals made to the paintings of other artists and the opportunity for one-to-one, peer-to-peer and group critiques and discussions. <br />
<br />
 <br />
2) Outline Content <br />
Throughout the duration of this class students will gain practise and competency in developing ideas through painting. This will be supported through various exercises which will include: <br />
Â· Value of the sketchbook<br />
Â· Generating ideas through the use of mind-maps<br />
Â· Investigating Composition<br />
Â· Employing a range of tools <br />
Â· Exploring collage and mono-printing techniques<br />
Â· Colour mixing and tonal design <br />
Â· Working from the model (optional) <br />
Â· Working with limited palettes <br />
Â· Gesture and layering <br />
Â· Working with coloured grounds<br />
Â· Scaling-up <br />
Students will work initially from still life and the model. Thereafter students will develop their own ideas with an emphasis on how to translate these ideas into visual outcomes. Studio practice will also be covered, including how to set up an efficient workspace, different ways of laying out a palette and cleaning up.<br />
<br />
3) Student Learning Experience <br />
The contact hours of this course will be delivered in a fit-for-purpose art and design studio and will include a range of theoretical and contextual presentations and discussions. This course involves hands-on learning approaches with introductions to techniques, concepts and practical and experimental making. <br />
By working through a series of activities, both in and outwith the class, students will focus on developing a series of studies based on ideas, observations and insights which they will use to develop into more resolved works.<br />
The course will draw from some group activities leading towards a focus on individual interests and personal projects. Over the course the students progress will be monitored and supported by the tutor via presentations, practical demonstrations, one to one tuition, group discussions and critiques.<br />
<br />
For the necessary study hours, out with class contact time, students will be required to self-motivate their personal learning with direction provided in advance by the tutor. Directed study will include research into a range of suggested artists and associated movements to engender a contextual awareness. Students will be expected to demonstrate how their research has informed their work with particular attention given to the student's use of sketchbooks, photography and critical note-keeping from gallery visits and fieldwork.<br />
 <br />
There will be an emphasis on keeping a Learning Journal throughout the course, which should provide a clear and continuous reflective record of any research, ideas and practical work, and a place to record and analyse any challenges experienced and to reflect upon how these were addressed.<br />
 <br />
Students will be actively encouraged to investigate the work of other artists through looking at books brought into the studio and visiting the library themselves. There will be an emphasis not only on well-known historical and contemporary painters, but lesser-known artists who may be found through online platforms. Students will be prompted to attend exhibitions and record opinions from these and their reading in their Learning Journal as well as sharing with the class.<br />
 <br />
Formative feedback will be offered by the course tutor to the student via their Learning Journals. On completion of the course, students will submit a portfolio of work ready for summative assessment. To pass students will be required to meet the three learning outcomes.

<br />
Each student will record and reflect on their presentation through their ongoing Learning Journal and tutor feedback will be summarised in written form through the Leaning Journal and back to the student focusing on specific strengths and what areas need to be addressed in order to meet the learning outcomes based on the formative assessment presentation. <br />
<br />

<br />
Learning Journal<br />
A reflective Learning Journal should be kept at regular intervals throughout the course. Ideally, students will submit one or two paragraphs each week comprising of around 100-200 words. supported by visual references as and when required. The Learning Journal is then submitted electronically alongside the portfolio submission. The Learning Journal accounts for 20% (20 hours) of the indicative hours of the course and feeds equally into all three Learning Outcomes.<br />
