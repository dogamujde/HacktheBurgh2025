<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">The ePortfolio course is designed to enable students to hone their critical gaze and analytical skills, required for professional development and reflective practice. Offered in the final year of the part-time MSc programme, students are given an opportunity to craft and present an evidence based professional account of their learning progression. <br />
This course, which is an alternative to submission of a research-focused dissertation, builds on the foundations of critical inquiry. The dissertation by ePortfolio is set to support students to adopt a more systematic, disciplined and rigorous way of thinking about both their practice and their learning. Learners will also develop a stronger, more confidant sense of academic identity or self-authorship, using communication tools such as blogs/vlogs and other (social) media channels. <br />
Using a collection of authentic artefacts, the student should present diverse evidence to demonstrate attainment of intended learning outcomes. Artefacts can be audio and/or video files as well as written or pictorial digital assets.  The rationale for and the integration of artefacts, as part of a cohesive collection, must be linked to core themes in the MSc programme as a whole.<br />
A framework for the final submission should demonstrate learner's achievements in capturing evidence that they have gained competencies across the 7 facets of mastersness:<br />
Level of complexity, Degree of abstraction, Depth of learning, Research and enquiry, Degree of autonomy and responsibility, Complexity and unpredictability and Professionalism (Bamber 2013).<br />

    Academic description<br />
The final stage of the MSc programme culminates in an extended, self-directed piece of work based on a project that was agreed in advance with a supervisor/mentor. The role of the supervisor, in supporting the learner, is critical and ongoing interaction is essential for the success of the course. We will have a dedicated resource and a robust plan to ensure supervisors are prepared for their role, in advance of the start of the course.<br />
At the heart of a dissertation project is the  application of meta cognitive skills, learnt whilst on the MSc programme, and the acquisition of new Skills. This dissertation course aims to give students options and an opportunity to further develop their practice. Learners need to apply their learning by crafting a substantial and sustained independent piece of work to showcase 'Masterness'. <br />
<br />
Outline Content<br />
The dissertation will assess the students' ability to design and complete a significant project, investigation or development. It encourages students to creatively tackle a challenge and to reflect and critically review their progress. Learners will be expected to consolidate as well as extend their knowledge, skills and practice as well as communicate outcomes and impact in an accessible and relatable way.<br />
<br />
Student Learning Experience <br />
The e-portfolio takes nine months (part-time) to complete, and is largely self-directed. The course supports students with a dedicated virtual learning environment (PebblePad), online tools, as well as interactions with a dedicated supervisor. <br />
SupervisorÂ¿s support can take on many forms and may be provided face-to-face, or remotely, to best meet individual needs. Supervisory support will be supplemented by the detailed dissertation course handbook given to all students.<br />
It is advisable for learners to seek mentorship and support from their place of work, to ensure the final outcome has the desired impact on and in practice.<br />

<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" width="15%">Graduate Attributes and Skills</td>
<td width="85%">1) Mindsets:<br />
<br />
Enquiry and lifelong learning<br />
Students on this course will be encouraged to seek out ways to develop their expertise in leadership and digital transformation. They will also be encouraged to strive for excellence in their professional practice and to use established and developed approaches to share learning with peers and networks.<br />
<br />
Aspiration and personal development<br />
Students will be encouraged to draw on the quality, depth and breadth of their experiences to expand their potential and identify areas they wish to develop and grow. Students will also be encouraged to understand their responsibility within and contribute positively, ethically and respectfully to the health, housing and social care community while acknowledging that different students and community members will have other priorities and goals.<br />
<br />
Outlook and engagement<br />
Students will be expected to take responsibility for their learning. Students will be asked to use their initiative and experience, often explicitly relating to their professional, educational, geographical or cultural context, to engage with and enhance the learning of students from the diverse communities on the programme. Students will also be asked to reflect on the experience of their peers and identify opportunities to enhance their learning.<br />
<br />
2) Skills: <br />
<br />
Research and enquiry<br />
Students will use self-reflection to seek out learning opportunities. Students will also use the newly acquired knowledge and critical assessment to identify and creatively tackle challenges faced by service users and providers.<br />
<br />
Personal and intellectual autonomy<br />
Students will be encouraged to use their personal and intellectual autonomy to critically evaluate the literature and their learning. Students will be supported through their active participation in self-directed learning, discussion boards and collaborative activities to critically evaluate concepts, evidence and experiences of peers and supervisors from an open-minded and reasoned perspective. <br />
<br />
Personal effectiveness<br />
Students will need to be effective and proactive learners that can articulate what they have learned and have an awareness of their strengths and limitations and a commitment to learning and reflection to complete this course successfully.<br />
<br />
Communication<br />
Effective leaders in the health, housing and social care sectors require excellent oral and written communication, presentation and interpersonal skills. The structure of the dissertation courses will reinforce and develop these skills.<br />
