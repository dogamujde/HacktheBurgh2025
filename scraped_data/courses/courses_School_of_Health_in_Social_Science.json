The live sessions are timetabled, whilst the asynchronous sessions are not. In total the course is made up of 15 lessons, each one is approximately 1.5 hours of asynchronous learning and 1.5 hours of live online session. The course will embrace a flipped classroom pedagogy, in which live digital interaction will be used to deepen and practice elements of education that are delivered in a self-paced manner.The course covers the basic conceptual knowledge, skills and personal qualities required to deliver the modern form of cognitive behavioural therapy called Acceptance & Commitment Therapy.",
    "course_description": "This course will introduce you to the Head, Hands and Heart of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT, said as one word, never as three letters). The head of ACT is the knowledge and concepts of ACT, the theory of Psychological Flexibility, the underpinning theory and philosophical assumptions of Contextual Behavioural Science, and the parallel development of Relational Frame Theory. In addition, you will learn about the empirical evidence for ACT in cross sectional, experimental and controlled trial outcome research. The hands of ACT refers to the craft and skills of delivering ACT, the practice elements of how to actually do it. The heart of ACT refers to the personal qualities of the therapist that ACT training aims to cultivate. This involves the therapist becoming more psychologically flexible in their professional environment. You will learn these aspects through pre-recorded lectures, watching video of simulated therapy, analysing these interactions, discussion, Q&A, and engaging in role-play and real play in an online platform.",

The course will reflect on the challenges of this phase of therapy and build re-formulation skills.Successful students will be able to explain the difference between assessment and formulation, be able to demonstrate the formulation of a range of common clinical presentations and illustrate how formulation individualizes a treatment plan.Students will be expected to reflect on key issues in formulation i.e. diagnosis vs. formulation, the evidence-base for formulation-driven therapy, adapting formulation to specific client groups.",
    "course_description": "This course will cover the core features of engagement, developing formulation and the assessment required to ensure a successful formulation is possible. Students will develop the skills to build an account of why and how problems have developed and to analyse how processes are maintaining difficulties in the present.  Students will explore the types of assessment information available and the methods that can be employed to gather knowledge.  Through practical methods students will learn types of formulation, how to reformulate in the face of new evidence and how to manage the challenges and pitfalls of this essential part of the therapeutic process. Students will learn to adapt their formulation skills to a range of presentations, developmental stages and settings.  Course content will contribute the British Association of Behavioural & Cognitive Psychotherapy Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes Framework and so will support individual accreditation.This course will support students to understand the key aspects of formulation and to develop the ability to adapt these skills to a range of clinical presentations, age groups and clinical settings.  Assessment and formulation are key clinical skills and students will learn in a practical-based format using case examples, fictional scenarios and observing expert practice.  Lecturers will cover the knowledge and describe key skills and small group formats will be used to practice case-based skill development.",

Formulation is central to the successful use of evidence-based interventions such as CBT.  Formulations helps the client and the therapist understand where and how the current problems have come from and what is maintaining them, often making connections and sense of a wide range of positive and negative factors. Being able to formulate well will allow students to take understanding from the general to the specific and allows  interventions to reflect the specific challenges in a person's life.  Students who learn to formulate well will learn to how keep therapy on track by providing an understanding of the personal barriers and blocks that people bring to therapy.  By learning to share formulations with clients, students will empower the clients through the provision of a shared rationale for understanding of the issues and how the intervention is expected to make a difference.  This shared understanding empowers a client to become their own therapist and helps the students plan for discharge, relapse and the natural challenges of day to day life after therapy.",

These will provide students with a theoretical basis from which to understand what, and how, different factors contribute to the development (and maintenance) of psychological disorders in this client group.The course will also introduce students to the concept of formulation through the provision of formulation models applicable to the client group.  These will illustrate the way in which information gathered through multiple assessment processes can be integrated to provide an explanatory account of a client's presenting difficulties. Further, the use of such models will provide a platform from which to identify appropriate forms of intervention for children, young people and families.The course will introduce students to a range of clinical problems and presentations relevant to the client group varying in severity and complexity. This will provide a knowledge base from which trainees can make informed assessments of the needs of children and young people experiencing a wide range of clinical difficulties.Please note: this course is available to students on the MSc Applied Psychology for Children and Young People programme only.",

They will also be introduced to a range of research methods in this field, and how research questions can follow from observations of humans and animals, and lead to theoretical and practical implications. There will be reference to informative case studies throughout the course.The content will include:-\tAn introduction to biological psychology as a field, biological systems (neural, and endocrine) and research methods-\tThe stress response and its relationship to health, behaviour and mental health-\tCircadian rhythms, sleep, dreaming and disorder-\tBiological contributions to mental illness (e.g. schizophrenia, depression, substance abuse)-\tSex hormones, cognition and behaviour-\tDrug effects, addiction and psychopharmacologyStudents are expected to engage with about 2.5 hours of structured teaching activities every week. This will include pre-recorded short lectures, online activities and group work. Structured teaching will be complemented by additional reading available on Learn. The course is designed for students to gain breadth of knowledge of the field and the debates within it, as is appropriate for a Psychology conversion degree course.

Through a series of workshops drawing on the expertise of visiting clinical contributors, and regular online synchronous and asynchronous tasks, students will be introduced to the core elements of CBT as they applied to complex presentations, including formulation and re-formulation, engaging young people in a change strategy, and developing and maintaining a therapeutic relationship in the context of interpersonal difficulties. Students will simultaneously complete a supervised placement comprising a minimum 50 hours of clinical contact with at least 5 cases presenting with various complex disorders (minimum 3 different types of presentation should be evident). Students will develop a portfolio of supervised clinical work demonstrating CBT practice, reflection and evaluation. Students may wish to increase their contact hours to a level that allows for application for individual practitioner accreditation with BABCP.",

    "course_description": "International migration has increased over the past five decades, with an estimated total of 272 million migrants, including 79.5 million forcibly displaced people at the end of 2019 (UN IOM, 2020; UNHCR, 2021). The most recent global estimate of child migrants is approximately 31 million, and of these, 13 million are child refugees, 936,000 asylum-seeking children, and 17 million children who have been forcibly displaced inside their own country (UN IOM, 2020). It is well established that migration puts children at an increased risk of developing mental health problems due to exposure to adverse migration experience.This course provides an introduction to the key theories and concepts of development, psychopathology and social psychology within a migration context, and implications for policy and practice. Through a combination of synchronous and asynchronous learning activities (e.g., online lectures, tutorials, group work and discussions) the course offers students an opportunity to develop critical awareness and biopsychosocial understanding of the link between migration experiences and mental health outcomes in migrant children, asylum-seeking children and child refugees, and their families.The course assumes a biopsychosocial approach to understanding and conceptualising mental health problems in the migration context of children and young people, and it will cover a multiplicity of themes that are divided into four components, including 1) developmental theories (e.g., psychosocial development theory, ecological systems theory, attachment theory) as a framework to conceptualise the complexities and influence of migration on human development; 2) psychological difficulties associated with migration experiences (e.g., common mental health problems, migratory mourning and stress); 3) social psychology theories to evaluate the influence of social and cultural factors (e.g. acculturation, identity development, group processes, discrimination, social networks) on migrant children's, asylum-seeking children's, and child refugees' mental health and wellbeing; and 4) culturally-sensitive clinical practice and policy development (e.g., housing, welfare, schooling, employment) and settlement policies.

    "summary": "The need to train more front line professionals in evidence-based approaches to enhance children's mental health and psychological well-being is a high level policy priority of both the Department of Health (DH) and the Department for Children, Schools & Families (DCSF). Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) has been identified as one of the most evidence-based interventions available currently and is a priority area for increased training provision. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder all recommend CBT and other psychological interventions as a key treatment of choice.This course will provide participants with knowledge and understanding of the evidence-base for psychological interventions to promote psychological well-being in children and young people.  The strengths and limitations of cognitive behavioural, interpersonal and family based approaches, and how, drawing on systemic and other approaches, they can be adapted to work with young people will be covered.",
    "course_description": "The course will provide teaching on methodologies used to develop, test and critically appraise evidence-based psychological interventions and clinical research.  This will include some teaching on quantitative and qualitative research methods commonly used in clinical treatment research and how to interpret such findings.This course aims to provide participants with the knowledge and theoretical understanding of effective, evaluated interventions for children and young people experiencing a range of difficulties with social and emotional aspects of their development. Crucially, participants are encouraged to take an outcomes-based approach in ascertaining the interventions most appropriate to promote psychological well-being. We also aim to develop participants' skills in evaluating the impact of their own work in order to be able to reflect on and modify practice in future. The course will facilitate a forum for developing and sharing creative and flexible practice with colleagues from a range of professional backgrounds.",

    "course_description": "This postgraduate course is designed to enable learners to engage with different disciplinary approaches to global mental health, presenting these different perspectives as applied to key challenges in the global mental health field. The course will promote inter-disciplinary awareness and critical reflection via exposure to different perspectives on a number of global mental health grand challenges (e.g. common mental health disorders, scalability of services, perinatal mental health, young people's wellbeing; delivering cross-cultural mental health care;). Delivery will be by members of staff from the School of Health in Social Science and the School of Social and Political Science, alongside other professional disciplines from the Edinburgh GMH Network (e.g. psychiatry) and NHS colleagues, with one approach featured per session. The aim is to develop interdisciplinary awareness in the context of its translation into research, practice, and  policy.Over the course, students will be introduced to interdisciplinary perspectives via an overview of key concepts, and the identification of a number of interdisciplinary 'grand challenges' in global mental health. The course will then introduce interdisciplinary perspectives through showcases (based on different deliveries including face-to-face and podcast) of different disciplinary/professional approaches to a topic e.g. psychiatry, clinical psychology, social work and anthropology. As the course progresses, students will learn how to integrate these perspectives and translate this into a format that can inform research, policy and practice.The course will be taught over 10 weeks.  Lectures/seminars will combine face-to-face or podcast delivery with group discussion. Each session will be led by a University of Edinburgh lecturer or external stakeholders. These sessions will be supplemented by online reading and peer-led discussion boards. Students will engage in peer-learning through interactions with course deliverers; through discussion in the seminars and by participation in the assessments.",

    "course_description": "Interpersonal Psychotherapy provides a pragmatic, time-limited and focused approach to the treatment of major depression.  It is modest in its use of psychotherapy jargon and promotes attention to the relationship-based issues, which are central to the experience of many depressed patients.  The treatment does not become entangled in questions of causation, acknowledging the capacity for depression to both precipitate and reflect interpersonal change and difficulty.  Instead, it attends to difficulties arising in the daily experience of maintaining relationships and resolving difficulties while suffering an episode of major depression.  The fundamental clinical task of IPT is to help patients to learn to link mood with interpersonal contacts, and to recognise that, by appropriately addressing interpersonal situations, they may simultaneously improve both their relationships and depressive state.IPT strategies reflect a bias of attention towards the social world of the patient, while the techniques employed are common to many forms of psychotherapy.  IPT assumes a common experience among depressed patients, manifest in their social withdrawal, and declining expectations and performance across work, social and family domains as they are increasingly burdened by the emotional, cognitive and physical changes associated with a major depressive episode.The course will consist of a mix of lectures and seminars supplemented by online discussions.",

    "course_description": "This course is delivered entirely online as part of the MSc Mental Health in Children and Young People: Psychological Approaches (OL) programme; it can also be taken as a CPD option.The impact of social inequality on children has been well documented with research consistently highlighting negative outcomes in a range of areas. Research also highlights that with each step up the socio-economic ladder, the prospects for child well-being improves and that these improvements result in significant economic returns to society that far outweigh the original investment. Tackling social inequality, therefore, underpins a number of the Scottish Government's recent policies (The Early Years Framework, Achieving our Potential, Curriculum for Excellence, Equally Well, and Skills for Scotland) and the Getting it Right for Every Child (GIRFEC) agenda. This national framework requires that a comprehensive range of factors, including the child's developmental needs, parent's capacity to meet those needs, the child's environment and wider world, and the connections between these domains, be taken into account when considering the needs of children and young people; however, whilst significant guidance was provided, this focused less on the child's environment and wider world and the impact of social inequality in this domain.This course aims to consider this gap. The course will examine research on the impact of social inequality on children and young people and the recent policy direction aimed at tackling the problem. Further, by focusing on the ecology of childhood, which sees the child as part of a number of interconnected systems, including the family, social networks, schools, and the wider community, the course will also consider how inequality, within different domains of the child's life, can impact on their well-being, and how inequality in one domain can interact with those in another, to compound the disadvantage of individual children, young people and families.",

    "course_description": "Each module comprises of one 2-2.5hour lecture and some assigned reading; additional reading and multimedia materials are provided for further (optional) self-directed study. Each module will include applications of core social psychological theory to the analysis of mental health, including making connections through specific readings, consideration of research practice and findings, and academic interpretation of real-world phenomena. Overall, we will consider how many factors exist and interact within a wider Â¿systemÂ¿ of mental health for individuals and groups within the scope of social psychology.For example, the lecture on Self & Identity will include an introduction to Self-Concept, which is our cognitive representation of self. We will critically explore what happens when we feel/act/think at odds with ourselves and the implications for our mental health; we do this by analysing the application of self-discrepancy theory with explanatory example scenarios. In this way, we will study notions of self and develop critical, research-informed understandings of the specific role of identity. In this module, we also use primary readings to highlight how social psychology can contribute to understanding the protective and risk factors for various mental health issues (e.g., depression) and experiences (e.g., traumatic).The course is a core component of the MSc Psychology of Mental Health (Conversion) and is not open to students from other programmes. The course will run in the first teaching block of Semester 2.",

Trainees will gather experience of engagement, assessment, formulation, intervention and evaluation across a range of psychological problems, typically including, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and the effects of trauma. Trainees will be expected to use and develop a significant range of the competencies associated with working as a psychologist in adult mental health services. As is typical of psychological therapy, trainees will be expected to deal with complex issues and make informed judgements, considering multiple sources of information, which may sometimes be incomplete. Trainees will be expected to form appropriate professional relationships with colleagues and clients / patients. Trainees will be expected to work from a professional code of ethics and to interpret and apply this. Trainees will also be expected to work from the evidence base, using practices based on research evidence and to engage in reflection through regular supervision of practice.",
    "course_description": "a) Academic DescriptionThe placement will take place in NHS settings under the supervision of a Clinical Psychologist. There may be situations where trainees are supervised by more than one supervisor or by other Applied Psychologist(s) (e.g. Counselling, Forensic) or by members of other professions according to the Programme Eligibility criteria for supervisor which are found in the NHS and Clinical Practice Placements Handbook. In the remainder of this text the word supervisor denotes supervisor(s).The placement will be scheduled to last a minimum of 5-6 months and trainees will be on placement for 4 days each week apart from weeks when they have teaching (see Handbook for details). During the placement, trainees are required to demonstrate principles of work relevant to clinical psychology practice and the application of evidence-based practice governed by psychological models and concepts. During Adult Mental health placement, trainees will have 1 study day per week apart from weeks when they are receiving teaching (see Handbook for details). This time is for reading and study relating to placement as well as relating to any academic coursework.b) Outline ContentTrainees will see a range of clients of working age for psychological therapy. The range of problems may include phobias, OCD, PTSD or other post-trauma work including childhood abuse, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, psychosis, complex bereavement, psychosexual problems and interpersonal/relationship problems. Trainees can expect to experience cases involving assessment of presenting problems, leading to formulation and treatment plans, direct treatment with clients with whom the trainee is the prime worker, indirect work with clients e.g. advising staff or relatives, development of skills in interviewing, formulation/treatment and use of and interpretation of relevant testing/questionnaire material, including neuropsychological assessment where possible. Trainees will gain experience of cognitive behavioural techniques. Where possible, they should also have the opportunity to participate in teamwork. During the placement, trainees are expected to have a range of experiences and client contacts, such that they are able to demonstrate competencies in the application of psychological theory to practice relevant to this population. All trainees are to complete client feedback questionnaires with at least two clients per placement and a session-by-session feedback questionnaire on client experience with at least one client during training.c) Student Learning ExperienceTrainees will be on placement in NHS settings working clinically with clients/patients. These placements are frequently within NHS adult psychology services, though a wide range of other service settings may be encountered, such as community mental health teams, in patient mental health settings or other services for people with psychological disorder. The placement may take place across different locations or services. Trainees will receive regular supervision from their supervisor(s) in line with guidance from the professional/accrediting bodies, in addition to other informal contact and input, sometimes from other psychologists or team members. Trainees can expect to observe their supervisor(s) on at least 5 occasions during the placement. Trainees are expected to be observed on at least 5 occasions by their supervisor(s) during the placement, in order to receive feedback on their performance and for the supervisor to be able to evaluate their progress towards their standard and personalised learning objectives and implementation of agreed changes. It is expected that the supervisor(s) will use the Cognitive Therapy Scale - Revised (CTS-R) as a structured assessment of competence to provide formative feedback on at least 3 of these observations of the trainee.",

These  take the form of a paper describing a piece of empirical research and a systematic review/meta-analysis of the literature in a related area.Please note that due to the nature of the course, which essentially takes part over 3 years for full time trainees, the course credits are spread across the years of training. Twenty credits are nominally allocated to year 1 and year two with the remainder, comprising 140 credits in total, awarded in the final year.",
    "course_description": "The DClinPsychol thesis is a 140-credit doctoral thesis which trainees work towards during all years of their training. Whilst most tuition for the thesis is provided via individually tailored research supervision with academic thesis supervisor(s), relevant whole class teaching is shared with the Research 1 course (which involves preparing a thesis proposal to aid trainees in project risk assessment and project planning) and the Research 2 course (which involves undertaking a small service related project). There is an emphasis on teaching transferable research competencies, such as project management, data management, writing concisely, preparing research reports for publication and systematic critical appraisal of literature.Specifically, learning and teaching activities comprise; Lecture hours 55, Project supervision 72, Fieldwork hours 540, Feedback / Feedforward hours 43, Summative assessment hours 2, programme level learning and teaching hours 28, directed learning and independent learning hours 660. Total hours 1400.Academic thesis supervisors are selected to enable a best possible match of their research expertise to the requirements of the project. These academic supervisors are allocated within the first few months of training and then meet with the trainee for research supervision once a month, in addition to providing feedback on drafts of proposals and chapters. A clinical thesis field supervisor with expertise in the area of the project is also expected to be part of the research team. Class teaching and thesis supervision are supplemented by e-learning resources on the Research and Statistics and Thesis sections of Learn.Assessment is via a doctoral thesis, which includes a systematic review and an empirical project written up according to the guidelines for a suitable peer reviewed journal. The thesis should not exceed 30,000 words and is assessed in accordance with the current University of Edinburgh Postgraduate Assessment Regulations for Research Degrees.",

There may be situations where trainees are supervised by more than one supervisor, by other Applied Psychologist(s) (e.g. Counselling, Forensic), or by members of other professions according to the Programme Eligibility criteria for supervisors which are found in the NHS and Clinical Practice Placements Handbook. In the remainder of this text the word Â¿supervisorÂ¿ denotes supervisor(s)Depending on the availability of placements, it may be that some trainees will complete a split placement in conjunction with an elective half placement.The placement will be scheduled to last a minimum of 5-6 months and trainees will typically be on placement for 4 days each week apart from weeks when they have teaching (see Handbook for details). During the placement, trainees are required to demonstrate principles of work relevant to clinical psychology practice and the application of evidence-based practice governed by psychological models and concepts. During this placement, trainees will have 1 study day per week apart from weeks when they are teaching (see Handbook for details). This time is for reading and study relating to placement as well as academic coursework.b) Outline ContentDuring the placement, trainees are expected to have a range of experiences and client contacts, such that they are able to demonstrate competencies in the application of psychological theory to practice relevant to this population. If the trainee is on a split placement, particular key experiences will be prioritised.Relevant experience might include:1) Assessments for intellectual disability (using reliable and valid measures), that show an integration of cognitive functioning, adaptive functioning and development history.2) Work with clients presenting with emotional and behavioural difficulties.3) Case(s) where there is an issue of declining cognitive abilities.4) Case(s) involving transitional issues, for example, an adolescent leaving school/home or an adult moving from one care setting to another.5) Cases(s) that involve sexuality or relationship issues.6) Cases involving behaviour that challenges, using assessments and interventions based on Positive Behavioural Support.7) Indirect work, which will encompass describing psychological principles to staff and family carers.8) Collaborative multidisciplinary (and if possible multi-agency) work.9) All trainees are to complete client feedback questionnaires with at least two clients per placement and a session-by-session feedback questionnaire on client experience with at least one client during training.A wide range of referrals should be aimed for and could include the following categories:1) Clients presenting with a significant and a severe level of intellectual impairment.2) Experience of clients with sensory difficulties.3) Experience of clients with physical difficulties.4) Children (if possible).5) Working within a range of settings such as hospital (where possible) and community settings (for example, clients' homes, day provision and residential establishments).6) Participating in Teamwork.c) Student Learning ExperienceTrainees will be on placement in NHS settings working clinically with clients/patients. The settings may be in a psychology department or in a multi-disciplinary or multi-agency team. The placement may take place across different locations or services. Working with families or carers or staff from NHS and other agencies (eg social services, education) is usually a key element of intellectual disability clinical placements. Trainees will receive regular supervision from their supervisor(s) in line with guidance from the professional/accrediting bodies, in addition to other informal contact and input, sometimes from other psychologists or team members. Trainees can expect to observe their supervisor(s) on at least 5 occasions during the placement. Trainees are expected to be observed by their supervisor(s) on at least 5 occasions during the placement,  in order to receive feedback on their performance and for the supervisor to be able to evaluate their progress towards their standard and personalised learning objectives and implementation of agreed changes. It is expected that the supervisor(s) will use Structured Assessments of Competence to provide formative feedback on at least 3 of these observations of the trainee.",

Taking an historical perspective, the course starts with the discipline's foundations in psychoanalysis and traces its development through person-centred, humanistic and cognitve-behavioural therapy through to contemporary third wave and mindfulness-based therapies. The principles and core skills of therapeutic practice, along with the key features of the therapeutic relationship, are covered. The social and political contexts in which emotional and psychological distress emerges, and is treated, are examined. The course takes a decolonizing perspective, offering critique of the individualizing and Eurocentric bias of the theories of mental health problems that underpin the talking therapies and critically reflecting on therapeutic practice itself. While not providing a training in counselling skills, the course does contain an experiential component where students will have the opportunity to practise active listening and are encouraged to reflect on relevant personal experience of both help-seeking and help-giving.",

It uses a chronological approach to trace the origins of the discipline over time, beginning with the disciplineÂ¿s foundations in psychoanalysis and tracing its development through person-centred, humanistic and cognitve-behavioural therapy through to contemporary third wave therapies. Taking a social science and decolonizing perspective, the course offers critical reflections on how emotional and psychological distress and mental ill health have been conceptualised and treated by the talking therapies through time. Students are introduced to the common factors and shared skills of counselling and psychotherapeutic practice, while also taught the distinctive features of the various main theoretical orientations. Although not a counselling skills training, students will have the opportunity to practise active listening and will be encouraged to reflect on relevant personal experience of both help-seeking and help-giving.The course will be relevant to any student with an interest in emotional and psychological distress, mental health and the role of the talking therapies in alleviating distress and helping people live more fulfilling lives.The course is open to any student from any discipline.ContentSession 1: IntroductionSession 2 and 3: PsychoanalysisSessions 4 and 5: Person-centred/humanistic therapiesSessions 6 and 7: Cognitive-Behavioural TherapySessions 8 and 9: Contemporary Third Wave and Mindfulness-Based TherapiesSession 10: ConclusionStudent Learning ExperienceStudents will have a range of learning experiences, including interactive lectures, group work, discussion groups, blogs and listening skills practice in tutorial groups.

Underpinning this is the understanding that adverse childhood experiences (ACEÂ¿s) play an important role in the life chances of individuals.

    "course_description": "This course brings together a range of academic disciplines and literature to give students a broad understanding of drug policy, both international and national. While drug use and policy may be discussed as part of other courses, this is the only course that focuses specifically on drug policy, and the impact it has on society today.Drug policy is becoming increasingly visible as an important component of both health and legal policy. Around the world there are shifts which see drug policy moving to a health matter, and the contradictions that can have in the development and delivery of criminal justice and public health frameworks. The aim of the course will be to explore both criminal justice and public health approaches to drug policy, and will introduce students to the broader concept of a 'public good' approach.This course will be divided into three blocks:1.\tDrug use and Society: this block will look at why people use drugs, and explore the interaction between risk, harm, health andmorality in the development of drug policy. This section will have a sociological and health based focus.2.\tDrug policy frameworks: this set of lectures will introduce students to international and national drug policy frameworks,including regulations and legislation on the production, trafficking, supply, possession and use of illicit substances, and recentmoves towards decriminalization and legalization of drugs. This section will have a legal and public policy focus.3.\tPublic good approaches: this block will look at public good approaches to drug use, including how this interacts with bothpublic health and criminal justice approaches to drug use. Within this students will explore new and innovative uses for illicitdrugs in the treatment of depression, trauma and addiction. This section will have a social policy, legal and health based focus.Students will be expected to attend a weekly lecture and 1 tutorial per week, but there will be a range of online activities to develop and complete in addition to this. Drug use has become an important part of media and entertainment, and we will be looking at films, documentaries and online content to explore the narratives driving drug policy, and develop deeper understandings of how these narratives impact individuals and society.The assessments will provide several ways in which students can demonstrate their learning outcomes.Formative Assessment (not marked):An in class exercise where you will mark another students work and discuss. More details in class.The essay will allow you to expand on a topic covered in the first four weeks in greater detail.With the policy brief students will show that they understand the topic, and will be supported to develop a policy brief that highlights the tensions between public health and criminal justice approaches to drug use.",

In doing so it will give them a deeper understanding of the complexity surrounding evidence based health policy, criminal justice policy, and social attitudes to what can be termed 'wicked problems'.The course will also complement professional and academic learning across the School of Health in Social Science by introducing drug policy as a health issue. This in turn will enhance students' understanding of the complexity surrounding health issues that are also governed by criminal justice interventions - similar to recent Covid restrictions. As a result students will develop the attributes of being creative and critical researchers and thinkers, promoting confidence and courage to expand and fulfill their potential.Feedback from single lectures that have been delivered on other courses, but utilize this course content, have shown that students are introduced to ideas and material they have not come across before, and often this relates to personal experiences of problem drug use with family or friends. As a result there is an increase in understanding and compassion towards those suffering from drug dependencies, as well a wider acceptance of behavior which may not be desirable, but additionally may not be suitable to criminal interventions. As can be seen from the feedback, this will often give them the passion to engage both locally and globally on this very relevant topic.Finally, the assessment (both formative and summative) will enhance their learning by providing a space for them to become skilled communicators, and encourage them to be effective and influential contributors both in class and in their future career.",

Students are introduced to a range of social scientific perspectives on bodies and embodiment, and will learn to critically apply these to understanding human health, including a consideration of health experience, health care and health research.Topics covered are likely to include: symbolic, constructed and lived bodies in health and illness; the construction of race, ethnicity, sex and gender in healthcare practice and research; how embodied metaphors shape understandings of human health and ill-health, normality and abnormality.The course uses blended learning incorporating weekly 2 hour seminars and online activities. Seminars combine formal lectures with student led activity. Full participation in online and offline class activity is essential.

    "summary": "This course has been developed in association with EUSA's Disabled Students' Officer and in consultation with UG students from across the University to provide an opportunity for students to study disability from a social sciences perspective.  This intersectional, critical, social science course focuses on advocacy and the lived experience of disabled people.",
    "course_description": "This interdisciplinary course introduces students to the growing and important field of disability studies.  Recent events have drawn attention to the urgent need for societies to work towards ensuring that all people are enabled to participate fully and to be treated equitably at every level of social organisation.This course has a strong focus on the lived experience of disability and values the knowledge embodied in this experience.  It takes an explicit advocacy orientation,  exploring the range of challenges experienced by disabled people locally, nationally and globally, while critically examining policies and interventions aimed at helping to reduce and eliminate barriers to full participation.  It also takes an intersectional approach, looking at how disability intersecting with other aspects of identity such as race, ethnicity, age and gender provide additional challenges that need to be taken into account in interventions aimed at eliminating inequities.As an interdisciplinary course, we welcome students with an interest in the topic from any and every part of the University to join us in discussing and learning about this important topic and in building an academic community in which no one is excluded.The voices of disabled people are at the centre of this course, providing students with the opportunity to learn from the embodied, lived experience of disability.  In order to deepen understandings of this lived experience and to develop critical capacities in relation to evaluating policies and interventions for improving access and participation for all, the course will introduce perspectives from a range of social science disciplines.  We will critically examine the different ways in which disability has been (and continues to be) defined and understood within and without the social sciences and how this impacts on lived experience.  The course is team taught and from year to year will cover a different range of additional topics, which might include:;Disability in professional practice. How disability is approached across health and social-care practices and how this is experienced by disabled peopleNarratives of disability. How people story their lived experiences and how these stories come into conflict with and are shaped by other stories.Disability and gender.  How the intersections of gender and disability impact on lived experience and how taking an intersectional approach helps to improve advocacy, interventions and policy-makingDisability and design.  How can the design field and their approaches to disability help us to understand disability in the social sciencesDisability and technology.  How is technology changing the way disabled people participate in society?Care and disability.  Taking a feminist ethics approach to disability in society.The geography of disability.  How can human geography help us to understand the lived experience of disability?In keeping with best practices for accessible learning, the course will be delivered in a blended format, enabling flexible engagement on the part of students as needed.  This blended delivery includes on-campus teaching, which will be recorded and posted online, as well as online activities for everyone to engage in.  There will also be tutorial groups for pre-honours students and a weekly one-hour seminar for honours students.  Again, these will be delivered in a blended format, so that if students are unable to attend their group one week, they will be enabled to participate in some other capacity.All assessments will be coursework-based and are aimed at giving students the opportunity to focus on an area of disability studies of particular relevance, while integrating learning across the ten weeks of the programme.  In keeping of the advocacy orientation of this course, part of the assessment will be outward-facing, in the form of a blog-post.",

    "course_description": "Each year, students on the course will be presented with a real-world problem to work on in the local area. In 2018-2019, the topic explored was be how biodiversity impacts on human health in relation to University of Edinburgh greenspaces.The course will meet twice a week over the ten weeks of teaching.  The first meeting of the week will be delivered seminar-style in a classroom.  The second meeting will be longer (2 hours) and will involve a range of activities from group work to site visits and fieldwork.  Any costs involved in fieldtrips, such as public transit fares, will need to be covered by students.During the first week of class, you will be briefed on the issue to be addressed.  You will be supported in developing a learning plan for yourself and a collective learning plan with your classmates, which will provide the roadmap for the work that you undertake to prepare yourselves for and implement a strategy for investigating the problem and proposing potential ways to address it. During the last week of class, you will present your findings and your proposed interventions to relevant community members.  The final report will be due during the exam period.The course will be student-led, meaning that you will collectively set the direction of study and research, with the course organiser and associated staff providing support and acting as resources for learning. Group work will play a significant part in your learning and assessment.  Two of the learning outcomes concern your ability to work in a group context. Support and resources will be provided throughout the course to enable you to develop and hone your group-work skills.You will be assessed both individually and as a group. Individually, your attendance, participation and awareness and evidence of how you worked in and contributed to the group and to group assessments will be assessed. Collectively, as a group you will be assessed on your ability to identify, define, conceptualise and analyse a real world problem and execute a defined project of research to address that problem. You will also be assessed collectively on your abilities to present your findings to an informed audience.This course will provide you with the opportunity to further your academic learning, your critical thinking skills and your employability, it will also enable you to make a positive difference in your local community and in the world right now.",

    "summary": "The changes, both advances and challenges, in the current global circumstances have an impact on mental health as well as on what we understand health or illness to be. This course reviews the role of counselling in addressing mental health in the light of this changing landscape. To this end, it will explore in depth 1. the appropriateness and limitations of counselling considering its meaning as, predominantly, a one to one, face to face talking therapy; and 2. What it can learn from alternative approaches within counselling and from other disciplinary approaches and practices that are concerned with questions about suffering and wellbeing.",
    "course_description": "Current changes occurring on a global scale, e.g., migration/mobility, growing spectrum of diversity (gender, neurodivergence), climate crisis, health and economic precarity, ask for evermore critical and innovative approaches to mental health. Counselling (predominantly understood as one-to-one talking therapy) is socially recognised as one of the means that supports people through emotional challenges and life upheavals. However, historically and across different cultures a wider range of systems of knowledge and practices have assumed this role, some of which are increasingly met in the Western world informing and/or challenging the predominance of one-to-one talking therapies. The course will explore alternative ways of thinking and working with human suffering across different disciplinary fields and socio-cultural contexts. Its aim is to challenge as well as inform dominant notions of counselling through examining notions of suffering, mental health and healing across different borders. By borders, we mean the geographical borders as well as socio-political, cultural and disciplinary borders that shape and produce different approaches to mental health and subsequent helping practices.The course is designed to develop around different approaches to suffering and healing within counselling as well as across other disciplines and geo-political locations. Keeping counselling at the centre of each lecture, we will review how existing and developing approaches, within and outside the counselling field, can inform the practice of counselling. The course will critically review the contribution that approaches outside of counselling can make to suffering and healing, namely: 1. decolonial, 2. queer, and 3. spiritual approaches. The course will also review and critically explore existing or developing approaches within counselling, namely: 4. creative, 5. existential/philosophical, 6. ecological, 7. community based, and 8. virtual approaches. The lectures will focus on how each of the above approaches holds different assumptions about what constitutes suffering and healing.The course will run for 10 consecutive weeks and will consist of weekly lectures directly followed by group seminars. The lectures will explore in critical depth the above approaches and how they challenge and/or advance existing approaches to counselling. The course materials will include theoretical papers and case studies from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds to ensure students critical and practical engagement with the topic in its breadth. The group seminars aim to offer an experiential and collaborative space of learning by inviting students to engage with the materials from the place of their own practice/experience in their helping roles.Aims of the course:-\tTo develop critical perspectives that broaden the conceptualisation and practice of counselling as a one-to-one talking therapy.-\tTo foster a critical awareness of how difference and diversity can be addressed through alternative and interdisciplinary approaches to counselling.-\tTo critically examine how power dynamics shape dominant notions of suffering, mental health and helping practices.-\tTo apply alternative approaches to healing and mental health to enhance and broaden helping practices such as counselling.",

This course focuses on situations where language and/or country of origin/nationality/ethnicity are not shared in the therapeutic (or educational) context. This 'large culture' approach is not intending to 'other' foreign individuals or to reduce or overgeneralise their experiences but to attend to issues that seem to be at the core of counselling (and counsellor education) in today's globalised world. This course will help students advance their awareness and understanding of the 'field' of intercultural counselling and will assist them to critically appraise common theories and practices in counselling practice and education. It will also invite them to use creativity for self-reflection and for considering alternative practices in counselling and counsellor education.The course will be delivered as a series of 8 2.5hr-long seminars. Each seminar will entail theory delivery, reflexive individual work, a creative element to assist self-reflection or promote understanding of the topic, experiential group work and discussion. A 'self-directed learning' approach will be endorsed, with students being invited to have an active role in the direction, focus and deepening of their learning.",

It introduces students to psychosocial thinking on how these histories play out in the ongoing present and offers opportunities to reflect on counseling and psychotherapy as a political project for working through historical trauma, racial oppression, marginalisation and violence in the collective history. Topical issues such as the political totalitarianism, hostile environment, alt-right extremism such as the Incel movements, will be explored to prompt in-depth, personal, psychosocial reflections on the connections between sociopolitical issues and psychological experiences. Students will further draw on these explorations to form thoroughgoing reflections on how an anti-oppressive, politically responsive, and decolonial practice may be embodied in counselling and psychotherapy training, practice, and research as well as what barriers there are to these in relation to decolonising counselling and psychotherapy.",
    "course_description": "1.\tAcademic Description of course (learning aims, nature and context)This course is born out of the growing recognition of the need, as well as the political urgency, to decolonise counselling and psychotherapy as informed by post-colonial critiques and racial justice, with a key aim to challenge the Eurocentric lens which informs traditional therapeutic approaches to training, practice, and scholarship and to develop more politically progressive and responsive alternatives in line with the EDI incentives. This is the first course within the subject area that makes explicit its decolonial aims and centres the decolonial project in counselling and psychotherapy.The course aims to develop and promote critical awareness of racial oppression and inequalities in the aftermath of colonialism and Eurocentric supremacy and how these are sustained by ongoing sociopolitical practices, policies and discourses which exclude and subjugate \"the other\". The course content situates the historical traces of colonialism as key shaping forces of the contemporary sociopolitical landscapes and social imaginations of how we perceive, understand, and relate to those who are subject to the oppressive processes. Students will be introduced to psychosocial thinking as a critical thinking apparatus to explore ways in which the inner world and the social environments are interrelated rather than separate and each permeate, influence, and give rise to the other in ways that are often unpredictable and non-linear. They will explore the role of the unconscious and unconscious processes in producing and maintaining sociopolitical and psychological mechanisms of forms of othering against the minority and disadvantaged groups and examine ways in which these impact on the psychological experience, identity, and social relations of the oppressed. Students will learn decolonial and postcolonial influences on counselling and psychotherapy to form creative and practical considerations of how relational, psychosocial approaches to counselling and psychotherapy may support and work with clients who are impacted by racial oppression as well as what may potentially generate and sustain oppressive practice in and through therapy.2.\tOutline ContentThe course introduces students to a range of topical, interrelated themes such as nationalism, whiteness, hostile environment, authoritarianism, and transgenerational racial trauma to facilitate psychosocial reflections on the impacts of racial oppression, marginalization and violence on culture and society at the macro level as well as on identity and psychological experiences of individuals and communities at the micro level, Most importantly, how these shape the past and present approaches to counselling and psychotherapy and inaugurate decolonial and postcolonial frames for counselling and psychotherapy training, practice, and scholarship. Each week students will learn key psychosocial theories addressing a topic, exploring the processes and the relationship between \"psyche\" and \"social\" in a context-specific, theoretically informed manner. Through this, students will be supported to develop a capacity to reflexively consider: \"what is happening\", \"how is this happening\", \"how do people do what they do and feel what they feel\". This will be done so in a manner that locates colonialism, racism and political violence as the empirical object of study. Connecting this with activist praxis, students will further draw on these understandings to develop reflexive connections between different forms of sociopolitical oppression and their implications for counselling and psychotherapy as a relational practice.3.\tStudent Learning ExperienceThe course will be a demanding learning journey, as it requires critical, explorative, interpersonal, and reflexive engagements with the course materials and course aims. To support the co-creation of an anti-oppressive, culturally sensitive learning environment, students and the teaching staff will collaborate on a learning contract at the start of the course that make explicit the expectations and demands of the course; the contract will outline ground rules that take respect for difference and diversity seriously and highlight the importance of self-care and wellbeing with signposts to ways and potential sources of psychological support. Please note that full attendance is expected of all students as an active member and co-creator of the learning environment.The ongoing, sustained psychosocial reflections invite students to draw on their lived experiences in exploring and understanding ways in which the personal is impacted by the socio-political and vice versa. Students will be supported to make theoretical engagement in line with the weekly theme during lectures and will be invited to reflect on their positionality and how this informs their views to enrich and contextualise theoretical engagement. For example, they will reflexively consider how their own identity and socialpolitical positions may influence their understanding of \"who is struggling\" and how. Students will be encouraged to share personal reflections and professional experiences during the lecture and seminar and to both hold and consider divisive views across differences in order to bring together criticality and relationality, to critique as well as to remain reflexive of our own critiques. This is in line with the course's psychosocial premises that our own affective responses, viewpoints, and assumptions (and what generate these) have important, often implicit ramifications on how we relate to others and conceptualise counselling and psychotherapy. The learning experience on the course will be highly invigorating and rewarding as it equips students with frameworks and perspectives with which to understand the connections between forms of othering, oppressive mechanisms at the macro level and the psychological processes, relationships, identity, and interpersonal relationships at the micro level and how these may manifest in therapy and become worked through.",

    "summary": "This course is delivered at the cutting edge of rapid and somewhat contested developments in the field of health / medical humanities and the arts. It aims to enable students to consider what different insights into the human condition add to understandings of health, illness and disability and to engage critically and creatively with philosophical, ethical and cultural questions raised by such understandings and the policy, research and practice implications. The course also aims to support students to participate in and help shape debates about the field's future directions and applications as they continue to unfold.The course incorporates critical social scientific approaches, drawing upon different understandings and traditions of 'critique'. Grounded in feminist theorising and its concerns with political and ethical questions related to difference and vulnerability, the course draws upon a range of contemporary and provocative perspectives including queer, critical disability, postcolonial and post-humanist theories to reveal and question liberal assumptions about what it is to be human and what this means for individual, community and global health.The course also critically explores the healing potential of the arts and their contribution to health. Students discover whether and how the humanities and the arts offer both intellectually stimulating and creative ways of (re)conceptualising and (re)presenting health, illness and disability, and how they might enrich knowledge of individual and community experiences of health and illness while challenging structural issues in society. To this end, it uses innovative, experiential and collaborative approaches to encourage 'hands-on' learning; and acknowledges and encourages the expression of personal experiences in the co-construction of Health Humanities and Arts knowledge. Creativity and 'research as practice' are central throughout this process. As students explore theories and concepts, they enjoy opportunities to write, reflect, philosophise and critique applied Health Humanities and Arts perspectives and practices and their lived effects.",
    "course_description": "Using active and participatory approaches to learning, this course considers the philosophical, social, spiritual, political and economic implications of individuals in relationship with human (and nonhuman) others and within wider systems against a backdrop of persistent local and global health inequalities and threats to sustainable development.It consists of ten 2 hour immersive sessions which focus on the following indicative themes:What is Health Humanities and the Arts, what are its origins and what are the key contemporary developments in the field?What does it mean to be well and healthy? What does it mean to be human?What are the (emergent) applications of the humanities and arts in addressing contemporary issues of individual, community and global health and illness?Student learning is collaborative, creative and active. Students will be encouraged to be 'outward facing', thinking critically about the ways that knowledge developed in the course can be applied in a range of settings.",

Students will learn and evaluate the philosophical bases for ethical practice and the underlying principles that inform core ethical codes and frameworks. Codes of ethics will be discussed in relation to practice issues, and understandings and theories of boundaries will be explored.  Students will examine these topics by drawing on their own professional and personal experience, considering and debating hypothetical ethical dilemmas, examining the impact of their personal values and accessing recent research literature.",
    "course_description": "This course aims to instill ethical awareness and promote ethical competence in postgraduate students prior to their placement work with clients.Students undertaking the full-time Master of Counselling (Interpersonal Dialogue) and Professional Doctorate in Psychotherapy and Counselling are expected to start therapeutic work with clients at an early stage in the programme. It is therefore necessary and professionally appropriate that they undertake a course focused on ethical practice prior to beginning their work with clients. While there is an existing course called Ethics, Boundaries and Supervision, it was designed to meet the needs of part-time Postgraduate Certificate students who are not in therapeutic practice but who may be working in a variety of helping roles (e.g. teaching, nursing, voluntary work), and is therefore pitched at a more general level. Consequently there is a need for a more specific, practice-oriented course geared toward the needs of full-time students about to enter their first therapeutic relationships under supervision.",

It will introduce students to various theoretical foundations for this type of work and to specific issues that may arise through the use of humanities and arts-informed methods, including ethical issues and questions around analysing and presenting the resulting data. Students will have the opportunity to explore humanities and arts-informed methods in relation to their own research interests and plans.",
    "course_description": "Health humanities is an emergent discipline, but one that builds on a rich recent history of humanities and arts-informed research into health. This course introduces students to a range of humanities and arts-informed methods for researching health. Methods under consideration will be subject to critical assessment, and students supported to reflect on the epistemological and ontological bases of different approaches, as well as the ethical challenges associated. The course is one of the core courses for the MSc Health Humanities and Arts, but will be of interest to postgraduate students across the University who are interested in employing humanities and arts-informed methods in the study of health.The course is structured around weekly 2 hour seminars. In most weeks, the course focuses on a particular humanities or arts-informed method (likely to vary from year to year, but examples might include poetry, narrative/fiction, participatory arts and film). Expert input, drawn from the School of Health in Social Science and other Schools, and occasionally from external speakers, will be complemented each week with supported discussion by the Course Organiser. This approach enables students to benefit from hearing a range of experience and expertise, practical engagement with different methods, whilst maintaining a critical stance in relation to methodological decisions and practice.Students will be encouraged to keep a reflective diary across the course. This will be drawn on in class discussions and used to support learning. Formative and Summative assessments provide opportunities for students to evidence and demonstrate achievement of learning outcomes. In each case, emphasis is placed on applying concepts learned in the course in a critical assessment of or response to humanities and arts-informed methods in 'real life' settings. This will encourage students to think critically about the benefits and limitations of 'doing' humanities and arts-informed research in the arena of health.",

    "summary": "This course will introduce students to key theoretical, philosophical, and historical perspectives, issues and debates on queerness. At the heart of this programme is the view that emphasises a multiplicity of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, Asexual, and + (LGBTQIA+) experiences that are grounded within specific political and ideological contexts. The course uses a decolonial optic that challenges dominant Western centrism within queer studies. The course engages with topics such as the everyday lives of LGBTQIA+ people; the construction of normal and abnormal genders, sexualities, relationships and bodies; queer futures; intersectionality of queer experience while keeping the focus on the locality and particular socio-historical context of queer lives. The course brings resources on transgender, gender expansive, and queer lives, touching upon struggles, resistances, and possibilities from diverse geographical locations and disciplinary perspectives. The implications and applications of such concepts and perspectives to real-world contexts, communities, and disciplines within health and social sciences will be considered. The course is open to counselling students and practitioners as well as other students and professionals such as healthcare and social workers, mental health practitioners, nurses, educators, and related disciplines.",
    "course_description": "Historically, research in counselling, health, and social science has seen Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, Asexual, and other nonconforming (LGBTQIA+) people through a heteronormative lens. Sociological, psychological, medical, and legal disciplines have often investigated these populations from a perspective of sexuality, which has created a limited view of what LGBTQIA+ life is and can be. Queer theorists have engaged with those limited conceptualisations of LGBTQIA+ life by showing there is more to queer life than the politics of sexuality. This course will introduce students to some of the key theoretical, philosophical, and historical perspectives, issues, and debates on queerness 'to confront the default heteronormativity of modern culture' (Warner 1991, 16).The course will engage with the multiplicity of LGBTQIA+ experiences and discuss to expose the axis of power around which queer life is evaluated. Thus, the course departs from a position that questions hegemonic narratives of social dominance, such as: the closet as a paradigmatic symbol of queerness (Adams, 2010), Western gaze as the predominant way of seeing the gay body (Lemebel 2000), contemporary research focusing on perils and struggles of queer life (Lalor 2018), amongst others. The course seeks to explore the potential of LGBTQIA+ life, what queer life can aspire to, dream of, and how it can be made possible like MuÃ±oz's (2009) work on queer futures and queer worldmaking.Bringing resources from diverse geographical locations and disciplinary perspectives, the course engages with topics such as the everyday lives of LGBTQIA+ people; the construction of identities, genders, sexualities, relationships, and bodies; intersectionality of queer experience; and queer futurity. The implications of such perspectives to real-world contexts, communities, and disciplines within health and social sciences will be considered. The course is open to a range of students from programmes across schools, including counsellors and psychotherapists, healthcare and social workers, mental health practitioners, nurses, educators, and other related disciplines.Course content will include:-\tIntroducing Queer theories and the implications of labels, identities, definitions, and language.-\tExploring the histories of normality and abnormality of queer lives and the parameters society uses to tell them apart.-       Queering ways of working with LGBTQIA+ people in mental health settings and other contexts.-\tMapping queerness to explore how the personal becomes political and how gender, sex and sexuality become politicised.-\tReflecting on the legacy of colonialism and the current ways in which coloniality is alive within queer lives and knowledge of LGBTQIA+ people.-\tThe everyday life and the ordinary: personal, social and cultural converge.-\tBeginning to know the plurality and intersections through discussion of the particular challenges of the LGBTQIA+ communities and the marginalisations within.-\tExploring queer futurity and queer thriving.In teaching this course that focuses on diverse queer experiences in applied social science settings, we are informed by queer pedagogy in our approach to teaching by deconstructing and disrupting the normalcies (Kumashiro 2002; Alexander 2005; Hickman 2011; Seal 2019; Mayo and Roriquez 2019). We are also drawing on Haraway's (1988) situated knowledge, and decolonial theories (Anzaldu'a 2012; Kulpa and Silva 2016; Johnson 2000; Lugones 2007) to speak to the multiplicity and particularity of localised subjectivities. By drawing on different locales and contexts and histories and moving away from the dominance of 'Anglophone hegemony' and Western-centrism (Kulpa and Silva 2016, 140), we want to present students with materials from across different borders. Hence, within our teaching, we will be consistently engaging with often under-represented queer subjectivities from the global South and East.Challenging some of the entrenched meanings and assumptions can be difficult and unsettling for students (and educators). In facing those uneasy conversations, feelings, and experiences, we do not aspire to create a 'safe space'. Instead, within the class, we want to encourage students to enter uncomfortable, 'brave places' (Arao and Clemens, 2013). As pointed out by Patti Lather (1998), educators (and following them, students) often try to avoid crises, closing off places of stuckness and discomfort in an attempt to maintain some form of control over what students learn. However, such attempts of control can often hinder anti-oppressive change and problematic dynamics within education settings (Kumashiro 2002; Allen 2015). We believe that along with the 'friendly', 'safe' and 'enjoyable' potential of learning environment, 'risky' and 'uncomfortable' are in fact pedagogically productive and, therefore, we want to embrace and cultivate the whole spectrum of spaces and experiences.Another aspect of 'queering' and 'decolonising' that we will be practicing in delivering this course, is moving away from deductive teaching methods to include more experiential, multimodal and relational teaching practices throughout our course. This incorporates moving away from pure reliance on peer-reviewed academic publications and including art, poetry, films, podcasts, activist sources and other materials that are produced by LGBTQI+ identifying people from around the world (whilst prioritising 'voices' from non-Western locales).",

These include, demonstrating advanced listening skills (beyond those required to be successful at PgCert level), evidence a capacity to begin client work, apply for and secure a placement as a trainee counsellor within the community, work with clients on a one to one basis, undertake supervision regularly to support this, engage in the learning tasks of the programme, make use of group work to continue to develop self-awareness, meet interpersonal challenges and continue to develop interpersonal resilience.  Because of these demands  which exceed what is required for successful completion of year 1 of their studies (the PgCert in Counselling Studies) - this course is intended to provide an opportunity to assess a student's readiness for counselling training.   This course and its assessment, needs to be successfully completed for students to progress into year 2 of their part-time professional training.

      "full_text": "This course is a pass/failThis course is assessed in 2 parts:Part 1: Self-assessment of readiness for counselling trainingEach of the assessment criteria for readiness should be used as a separate header, under which you should reflect on the degree to which you feel you meet the criterion. In your reflections you should include reflections on what you understand to be both your strengths and limits/ areas of potential challenge for you.  There are 10 assessment criteria to speak into and the submission is expected to be between 2000 - 3000 words in length. The headers are:1.\tMaturity and stability2.\tCapacity to learn from experience3.\tSelf-awareness4.\tEvident reflective process5.\tPotential to cope with the emotional demands of the training6.\tOpen to learning, feedback and personal development7.\tRespect for difference, diversity and principles of equality8.\tAbility to form and sustain helping relationships9.\tGood Interpersonal skills10.\tWell matched to the core orientation of the programmeAn accompanying professional reference should also be included in your submission. This should be provided by somebody that knows (or has known) you in a professional capacity. This can include having known you in a paid work role, voluntary role, or as a co-member of a committee of organisation (PTA for example). The referee should be asked to speak (as far as they are able) into each of the assessment criteria.Pass/fail CriteraYour written self-assessment will be assessed as a pass if the following are met:-\tA full and completed submission (self-assessment and professional reference)-\tThere is an acknowledgement of personal limits/ challenges as well as strengths represented within the submission.-\tAreas of development are acknowledged and identified as part of your written submission.-\tYour written submission includes a reflective account of your own process demonstrating a capacity for reflection.Your written self-assessment will be assessed as a fail if any of the following apply:-\tAn incomplete submission (this would include a missing professional reference missing sections of the self-assessment etc.)-\tA failure to acknowledge and identify areas of development as part of your self-assessment.-\tA failure to acknowledge personal limits/ challenges as well as strengths.-\tA descriptive rather than reflective account of your own process, failing to demonstrate a capacity for reflection.The written self-assessment will be marked by two members of the professional programmes teaching team. If the written submission is assessed as a pass, then the student will be invited to proceed to part 2 which is an oral assessment of their readiness for counselling training. If the written submission is assessed as a fail the student will be provided with feedback under the following criteria:-\tAn incomplete submission (this would include a missing professional reference missing sections of the self-assessment etc.)-\tA failure to acknowledge and identify areas of development as part of your self-assessment.-\tA failure to acknowledge personal limits/ challenges as well as strengths.-\tA descriptive rather than a reflective account of your own process, failing to demonstrate a capacity for reflection.Part 2: Oral Assessment of readiness for counselling trainingStudents who pass Part 1 will be invited to engage in an oral assessment of their readiness for counselling training. This will take the form of a meeting with two members of the Professional Programme Teaching Team, usually in the month of May on a day and at a time negotiated with the student. These are two professional colleagues, both of whom are usually involved in the Postgraduate Diploma training and are practitioners in the field of counselling and psychotherapy. This means they are well placed to understand the demands of counselling training and of client work. Occasionally, a placement manager, practise supervisor, or other colleague within the subject area will be one of the tutors who would be involved in this assessment, but in all instances, at least one of the two tutors will be involved in Diploma level training and post qualifying counselling practise. The two core PgCert tutors working closely with the student in year 1 will not be among the two professional colleagues involved in the oral assessment of a student's readiness for counselling training.The two tutors will formally assess the student's readiness for counselling training by asking the student to speak to a series of questions. They will use the readiness criteria to assess the student as either 'ready' or 'not yet ready' for counselling training.  If they assess the student as not yet ready for counselling training, they would expect to provide some feedback on their experience and assessment of the student to help them understand why they have reached their decision. They might also make some suggestions about activities that could help the student develop in one or more of the areas in which they felt further work was required to become ready for counselling training.We recognise that an oral assessment in the form of this type of meeting with two unknown professionals may feel challenging for some students.  However, the work of counselling is a deeply relational activity, and will require trainee students to meet new people with some frequency while on programme.  For example, students are expected to demonstrate interpersonal listening and responding skills as part of the placement readiness process in year 2. They also need to apply for a placement(s) as a trainee counsellor and often attend an interview(s) for selection. Sometimes the placement interview can be with a panel of placement staff. Students are also expected to begin their practice and come into relationship with clients (who may be especially vulnerable) and to be responsive and relationally oriented in these contexts.  While there is considerable support on the Diploma to support preparedness for this, it is also important that students are assessed in advance of this to ensure they are in a position to make good use of this support, and that they have personal circumstances and capacities to go on to meet the academic, personal, emotional, practical and relational demands of the training.It is hoped that this oral assessment gives an early opportunity for the student to present themselves to others, to come into relationship with others with authenticity, openness, and to make use of, draw on, and communicate their experiences to others effectively. It also offers feedback in the form of an assessment of their readiness for counselling training."

    "course_description": "Reflexivity is a core element of the professional and academic development of students in the social sciences (see Etherington, 2017; Finlay, 2003, 2017; SchÃ¶n, 2008). The importance of questioning our assumptions and how our subjectivity is part of our work has become paramount as a criterion for good professional practice and qualitative research scholarship.The conceptualisation of reflexivity is far from being univocal, reflexivities (Finlay, 2017) being a more appropriate term. Feminist and decolonial theories have thought about reflexivity as a political practice where the standpoint of people in underprivileged positions is crucial (Harding, 1991; Wynter & McKittrick, 2015). Poststructural and posthumanist theories (see Barad, 2007; Butler, 2005) have challenged the conceptualisation and practice of reflexivity. Put simply, these theories argue that there is not an already formed self to be reflexive about, and emphasise how knowledge, including reflexive knowledge, helps to produce a self rather than represent a self. These theories have questioned the autonomy and sovereignty of subjectivity and stressed the limits of our reflexive capacity. These challenges have inspired authors to both move away from reflexive practice (e.g. towards Â´diffractionÂ´- see, Barad, 2007; Davies, 2014) and to develop new conceptualisations of reflexivity whilst valuing what earlier forms of reflexivity produce/enable. (see, Pillow, 2003, 2015; Serra Undurraga, 2020,2021)This course will provide an in-depth review of the conceptualisation and practice of reflexivities across different theoretical frameworks. After reviewing the main ways in which reflexivity is understood, the course will explore how feminist, decolonial, poststructural and posthumanist conceptualisations of subjectivity radically challenge and transform how we think about the reflexive practice of making sense of ourselves. The course will have a pluralistic perspective (Serra Undurraga, 2020), critically considering how different types of reflexivity are the most useful in particular contexts because of what they produce/enable.In this course, the students will learn different ways in which subjectivity and reflexivity can be conceptualised and practised. Students will be encouraged to apply what they learn in each class to their professional practice and/or research. After completing this course, students will be equipped to critically analyse what different conceptualisations and practices of reflexivity (reflexivities) enable. The students will be able to conceptualise and make use of reflexivity in novel ways that will be applicable to professional practice and research.Content outline:- What do we mean by reflexivity and reflexive practice? Reflection and reflexivity in the social sciences- Feminism and reflexivity: Standpoint theories and strong reflexivity- Decolonial approaches to reflexivity: Gaze from below and borderlands- Reflexivity: an isolated practice? Relational conceptualisations of the self in reflexivity- Reflexivity and culture: Poststructural theories of subjectivity and reflexivity- Critiques of reflexivity: Posthumanist theories of subjectivity and reflexivity- Contemporary conceptualisations of reflexivity: Uncomfortable reflexivity, reflexivity as genealogy, diffractive reflexivity, performative meta-reflexivity- Integration and conclusions",

    "summary": "Service providers now have the responsibility to include local people or affected communities in their professional practice, particularly in the design and evaluation of interventions. Research, notably on health and social issues, is required to demonstrate community participation - more recently using terms such as public engagement and co-production. However, the extension of involvement in the traditionally expert-led processes of research, design and evaluation raises significant methodological and ethical questions for the research process.This course meets a training need for a range of individuals and organisations attempting to establish individual projects and the transformation of organisations towards greater community participation in research and evaluation. Organisations include statutory bodies (NHS, NICE, HSE), government departments and agencies, local authorities, independent health and social care providers (including charities), research and innovation institutions (universities, NIHR, MRC) overseas governments and international agencies (World Health Organisation, United Nations High Commission on Refugees, Oxfam). It aims to provide practitioners with a structured opportunity for study, dialogue, application and reflection.It will be offered as an option for students on the following  MSc degree courses Â¿ Public Health, International Health, Global Health: Non communicable Diseases, Integrated Service Improvement and Science Communication. When taken together, the two residential sessions will also constitute a stand alone CPD short course, with assessed and accredited components.This course will be taught using blended and work-based learning, including the use of a virtual learning environment. Students will gain an understanding of approaches to participatory research that involve communities as collaborators. Using an examination of a series of case studies, they will learn how to apply them in a range of contexts in professional practice, including the framing of research questions, data gathering and the interpretation of results for policy-makers. Students will learn core skills such as building collaborations with diverse types of individuals and communities, the co-design of research protocols and deliberative processes of dialogue and mutual learning.The course is aimed both at professionals attempting to apply these techniques in their organisations and graduate students who will propose, and where possible carry out, projects in collaboration with public and third sector organisations.",

A further key use of information is to increase organisational learning and knowledge by disseminating not just the outcomes of the service change but also the challenges met and addressed. This module will provide an introduction to the different methodologies, which can be employed in generating knowledge.",

Although endocrine conditions are not common, apart from diabetes mellitus (not covered in this option) and thyroid disorders the wide ranging effects of endocrine dysfunction and the fact that endocrine disease can affect every system in the body make it important that all nurses have at least a general understanding of this field.The proposed honours option will be taught in ten sessions of two hours in length over a ten week period. This format allows time for the introduction of theoretical content and subsequent discussion and debate about the relationship between theory, policy and nursing care. Visiting lecturers will be invited to share their knowledge and clinical expertise.  The course will use formal lectures, group work, discussion, multimedia presentations, practical sessions for clinical skills teaching, reflection and workshop type sessions to explore this complex and challenging topic.The course will address concepts such as quality of life and compliance and concordance, discussing these concepts in terms of real life issues encountered by endocrine patients.  The role of the specialist endocrine nurse versus that of the general nurse will be examined and nursing care of these patients discussed. The importance of good communication will be highlighted and the role of patient support groups explored, again with direct reference to endocrine patients.Throughout the course, attention will be given to the links between theory, policy and practice. Each topic will be explored in detail using a variety of learning and teaching styles in order to promote understanding of the theory and facilitate students' exploration of the relationship between theory, policy and practice.",

They will then undertake a long block of full time placement learning over the summer months to complete the required number of practice hours. Placements will be in a variety of settings and will provide students with the opportunity to experience practice with nurses, physicians and Allied Health Professionals. Students will be expected to work as supernumerary members of the multi-disciplinary team within the placement learning environment.  The final placement in this year provides the opportunity for students to experience healthcare in an international context, or a UK context outwith the standard provision for students within NHS Lothian and NHS Borders.Within the placement learning environment, students are supported by Practice Supervisors who are members of staff within the placement environment who have been suitably prepared to meet NMC requirements for the role.Fortnightly facilitated group reflective practice sessions will run in semester 1 and 2 to facilitate student learning through critical reflection on practice, bringing together their academic knowledge to understand their experiences and critically engage with their practice. These sessions will be structured and take a specific focus across the curriculum to encourage students to critically reflect on all aspects of nursing and healthcare. Students are required to keep a critical reflective account of their learning through these reflective practice sessions to support their learning.Students will engage in clinical skills development within the simulated environment including interprofessional simulation with medical students.

It takes the form of a research proposal on a discreet area of enquiry of potential impact to the discipline of nursing. Consistent with the aims of a research-led degree, the honours dissertation allows the student to demonstrate the ability to independently present a research proposal with the appropriate level of critical appraisal and knowledge of research and enquiry in the discipline of nursing.",
    "course_description": "The Honours Dissertation Course is designed to allow students to demonstrate their ability to work independently to construct a research proposal.Students are assigned a supervisor whom they work with on a one to one basis, preparing them to undertake extended independent work which addresses practice-based issues by employing methods of research. The dissertation supervisor provides one to one supervision sessions amounting to approximately 6 hours over two semesters.The production of a research proposal involves constructing a research question through the employment of a review of the relevant literature. The research proposal includes the composition of a clear plan of research with the overall research design and the associated research methods of data collection clearly appraised.Students will illustrate and appraise research methods, ethics and governance, in order to construct a critical analysis in which they safely use, share and apply research findings to potentially promote and inform the discipline of nursing.Students will evaluate what research has shown to be most effective for evidence-based to inform the discipline of nursing on their topic and by judging the evidence, examine policy and/or practice relevant to the health and/or social care of people.The composing of this dissertation contributes to developing the confidence and ability to illustrate thinking critically, applying knowledge and skills, and the ability to employ expert, evidence-based, knowledge and skills as required for registered nursing practice.",

The course aims to develop student understanding of complexity in healthcare, considering complex health needs across the lifespan. Through exploration of a series of complex health situations, students will be introduced to the challenges of co-morbidity and transition through and between healthcare systems. The role of the nurse in assessment and support of complex healthcare needs will be explicitly considered within the context of interdisciplinary teamworking. Students will engage with issues relating to pharmacological treatment and medicines management for people with complex needs, including legal aspects.  This course builds on learning in the life sciences and brings this knowledge together with learning around professional roles within the wider healthcare context. Transitions between healthcare services and between different phases of health/ill health will be considered within the context of lifespan.Outline ContentContent is expected to draw from complex healthcare experiences across the lifespan. Examples of material include; autistic spectrum disorders, childhood malignancy, learning disability, sensory impairment, moving between child and adult services, long term conditions, Multiple Sclerosis, Motor Neurone Disease, Parkinson's Disease, kidney disease, thrombophilia & haematological disorders, dementia, ageing, frailty, comprehensive geriatric assessment.Student Learning ExperienceThe course will be delivered in 8 classroom based teaching sessions and 2 seminar sessions. The classroom based sessions will include some lecture content, group work, facilitated discussion and engagement with digital resources. This variety of approaches aims to support a range of learning styles. Students are also expected to spend time reading supporting material and literature to enhance understanding. Online reading lists will be used to facilitate student engagement with the literature. Seminar sessions will offer an opportunity to engage with specialists in particular conditions and healthcare approaches. This is intended to permit multidisciplinary engagement and provide opportunity for students to questions those with expertise in particular areas of care. NHS partners and colleagues from within the wider University will contribute to teaching in particular areas. Group work will enable to students to explore topics in depth and to present critical explorations of relevant topics.The formative assessment feedback sessions will take place within a teaching session. Summative assessment presentations (30%) will take place in a specifically scheduled session of 3 hours. The presentation specifically is focused on LO4 but will include learning from across the course. All 4 learning outcomes will be assessed through a 'seen' exam allowing students to engage more deeply with topics which are of interest to them and explore literature in order to fully address the learning outcomes. The seen exam format allows students to work in exam conditions, within the examination period, reducing the demand of course work mid-semester and while on placement. The pre-prepared format encourages deeper engagement with the literature than a traditional examination format and is appropriate to the nature of this multifaceted material.",

This course builds on the previous Life Sciences content and skills alongside practice experiences. Key to this course is the co-construction of the content with the students. By drawing on their past learning and knowledge and skills acquisition they will be meaningful contributors to the planning and/or approval processes. With appropriate support, students will be able to apply and integrate their content knowledge of the pathophysiological processes in health deviation acquired in years 1and 2, and experiential knowledge from practice placements, and become equipped to deepen their understanding and critical appraisal of care to meet the desired and shared learning outcomes.",
    "course_description": "The aim of this course, at SCQF 10, is to enhance understanding of the pathophysiology, treatment and nursing care, and care experiences, of patients diagnosed with particular acute disease conditions. The content includes pathophysiology, aetiology, epidemiology, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, pharmacology and related patient care. Critically, students gain an understanding of complex clinical situations, the dependence of patients in vulnerable situations and the autonomy of patients whenever possible. The course focuses on identified pathological changes, investigations, therapeutic interventions and the care patients require in order to manage their illness and emphasises the importance of working in partnership with patients and their families in the delivery of holistic care. This co-constructed course is designed, therefore, to foster an assimilation of this material into an existing cognitive framework, drawing on a sound knowledge of life sciences, nursing care and decision making from the earlier courses in the programme. Learning will be part lectures, part student-led seminars appropriate for students at Honours level learning and relate to the learning outcomes and how these will be assessed.",

    "course_description": "Within this course you will study the principles of rehabilitation underpinned by a person-centred interdisciplinary approach.The course will explore common issues faced in neurological practice including physical issues of fatigue, spasticity, swallowing, pain, continence; neurobehavioral issues around cognition, behaviour, anger, rage with lack of inhibition or insight,  intellectual processing, memory, speech and language; wider issues around employment, family and social engagement.The issues will be related to the underlying neuroscience.Online lectures will introduce new topics in order. Discussion approaches, other online activities (e.g. Padlets, Blogs, Journals) and interactive exercises will enable you to explore, discuss and reflect on the key learning outcomes for specific material. You will have a weekly study pattern consisting of 1-2 hours of core material alongside ongoing interactive activities and reading; you will be studying and researching independently and reflecting on your practice experience. The course will be informed by the experiences of young stroke survivors.This course will run over a 10 week period. You will be expected to engage each week with the online material, with its directed activities, further study (both individual and collaborative), reading and reflection. The direct online input will be around 2 hours per week, but the follow on activities including online interaction with staff and other students will require additional time. Formative assessment tasks will be undertaken in weeks 3 and 6 with both peer and staff feedback. Summative assessment will be focussed on patient experience from their narratives and personal reflection.",

It will have a specific focus on the needs of young adults with stroke or other Acquired Brain Injury (ABI), their family and carers, but be relevant to a wider range of conditions and age groups.You will study the principles of rehabilitation underpinned by a person-centred interdisciplinary approach. The course will explore common issues faced in neurological practice such as the physical issues of fatigue, spasticity, swallowing, pain, continence; neurobehavioral issues around cognition, behaviour, anger, rage with lack of inhibition or insight,  intellectual processing, memory, speech and language; and wider issues around employment, family and social engagement. The issues will be related to the underlying neuroscience.Online lectures and other resources will introduce new topics in order. Discussion approaches, with other activities and interactive exercises will be supported by live seminar/ tutorial sessions and facilitated study circles on campus. You will have a weekly study pattern consisting of 1-2 hours of core material alongside ongoing interactive activities and reading; you will be studying and researching independently and reflecting on your practice experience.

This course provides students with the opportunity to work in small groups on a research project of their choice and to complete a dissertation.",
    "course_description": "The dissertation is an extended piece of writing of up to 10,000 words (minimum 9,000 words), based on independent study of a research topic. Students will, where possible, be encouraged to work in small groups (maximum of four), which will provide an additional element of peer learning and social support. Working in small groups will also allow students to engage in larger-scale projects, some of which may be publication worthy. However, all students will submit independent dissertations for assessment.This course allows students to conduct research collaboratively, to organise effectively bigger quantities of information and to communicate research findings in a fluent and structured fashion. The topic is negotiated with a supervisor from within the broad field of nursing, health and social science.This is a supervised course in which students will work autonomously, although work should be aligned with the research themes within Nursing Studies. The course consists of group study and research, under the guidance of a supervisor. The timetable is for students to negotiate with their supervisor, working from January through to the submission date of mid-August. Students will meet their supervisor regularly in that period, and receive advice on what to read, on emerging ideas, and - in due course - on drafts of the dissertation.",

Blended learning will involve online learning, lectures, tutorials and other materials accessible via the virtual learning environment (VLE).Students will be assigned a named supervisor for the duration of this course who will support students through student initiated supervisory meetings at regular intervals [ 8 hours in total] and providing feedback during these sessions on any discussion / written work as appropriate.",

Students will undertake a critical analysis of the literature and use this to design and present a research proposal. This course provides students with the opportunity to work with an academic supervisor on a research project of their choice and to complete a dissertation.The dissertation is an extended piece of writing of up to 15,000 words (minimum 10,000 words), based on independent study of a topic largely of the individual student's own choosing. It tests their ability to conduct a review of the scholarly literature in a systematic manner, to organise effectively larger quantities of information and to communicate research findings in a fluent and structured fashion. The topic is negotiated with a supervisor from within the broad field of nursing, health and social science.This is a supervised course in which students will work autonomously, although work should be aligned with the research themes within Nursing Studies. The course consists of individual study and research, under the guidance of a supervisor. The timetable is for students to negotiate with their supervisor, working from April through to the submission date of mid-August. Students will meet their supervisor regularly in that period, and receive advice on what to read, on emerging ideas, and - in due course - on drafts of the dissertation.",

Students may choose to take a single workshop although credit cannot be awarded for only one workshop.A typical workshop will consist of a 3 hour workshop session with a follow up. The latter may be conducted online or via email.The usual structure will consist of:- An introduction by an expert in the area, which will outline core themes and debates.- A hands-on workshop session with students. Students will be expected to come prepared to work and contribute.- A report-back and review.The follow-up will be for students taking the workshop for credit. It will consist of a set of reflections by the student on the themes and questions relevant to them that emerged from the workshop and commentary by the workshop leader. The workshop leader will advise on relevant literature for the student to review before completing their final report.Examples of workshops are:Grounded theory in health and social science researchSystematic reviews in healthcareConducting research with people with incapacityThe narrative approach in health care researchEthical issues in research with adults with incapacityQuantitative methods in natural experiment evaluation",

The content will provide students with a broad knowledge that enables them to identify signs of those who might be experiencing mental health problems and would benefit from specialist assessment and students will be equipped with an understanding of, and the ability to competently practice, a range of interpersonal and communication skills. Overall, this course will enable students to develop as reflective practitioners.The following is indicative content. The balance of content is subject to alteration in line with UK and global priorities in order to remain contemporary:- Historical, policy and global context of mental health and mental health services including stigma- Social, psychological and biological theory of mental illness- Recovery and recovery-oriented practice- Therapeutic approaches including pharmaceutical, psychological therapies, family based and psychosocial approaches- People experiencing altered perceptions- People experiencing altered mood- Adverse childhood events, trauma and mental health- Suicide and self-harm- Mental health as it relates to ages and life stages- Mental health as it relates to particular groups such as asylum seekers, LGBT+ community, people who misuse substances- Mental health legislation- Physical health care of people with mental health problems- Therapeutic relationships and interpersonal skills theory and practice- Promoting mental health- Assessment and care planning- Multi-disciplinary team members and their scope of practiceStudents will learn through three main routes: lectures, study circles and skills workshops.The course contains 20 hours of lectures to introduce students to main concepts in mental health care. These lectures provide students with the required building blocks of knowledge to be able to engage with the scenario-based study circle (Suoranta and Moisio 2006) work. The lectures will include discussion and other forms of interaction and some will be taught as flipped classroom with online lectures to be viewed prior to attending class. To maximise student learning the key reading should be done in advance.Study circles are based on the work of Suoranta and Moisio (2006) who developed these as a means of engaging students with their own and others' expertise in the teaching of social sciences. The circles will be formed of 4-6 students who will undertake the reading, make detailed summary notes of the main concepts and themes and present these to the group, participate in the group discussion.  The study circles will be focused on working through a scenario acquiring and sharing the necessary knowledge to undertake the assignment.Communication and interpersonal skills workshops will run across five sessions in which students practice, reflect on and develop an understanding of their own skills as well as the theories underpinning therapeutic communication. These workshops include a workshop focused on working with a person who practises self-harm, and another focused on talking with a person who is experiencing suicidal thoughts.",

    "course_description": "We will explore the dynamics of political influencing and political leadership by way of leadership capital drawing on relevant theories (Bourdieu, 1987; Bennister, t'Hart & Worthy, 2017) as a lens to understand how these align with political leadership and influencing in the sphere of nursing.In contemporary health care and policy, nursing has the opportunity to influence and lead change. What makes a successful political nurse leader? How much can they influence? How can we define political leadership in nursing? These are areas of critical reflection and learning students will engage with.Through Case Studies, students will be exposed to the role and influence of nursing political leadership on health-related policies linked to the initiation, development, influence and provision of diverse health care and programmes across the world. In addition, practical experience to focus and develop skills and techniques successfully, will be developed to enable students to 'read' the policy environment; identify targets for influence and develop and mobilise resources that lead the case for policy change. Together this will enable students to develop their political leadership, awareness and presence.The course will be taught over 10 weeks and will consist of 10 x 2hour online classroom sessions incorporating a Virtual Internship (Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10).  There will also be 10 x 1 hour (Skills/Techniques Development Groups) and will be student led with specific guidance focusing on a skill identified from classroom sessions. The Virtual Internship, will involve students having the opportunity to engage with local/global stakeholder organisations and nurse leaders on a topic related to political leadership. This element will be facilitated by an academic and the use of 'An Audience with Case Studies' from the Virtual Internships.This course will be taught as hybrid delivery drawing on the Case Studies from a range of nurse political leaders from across the globe. Students are expected to engage with their learning through group discussions, lectures, reading relevant scholarly literature and interaction with stakeholders in the field of health policy through taught sessions.",

Many more people are living into their old age with an associated increase in the prevalence of chronic and age related disorders. The use of Telecare, to support care at home, is celebrated as a means to promote efficient and effective health and care service provision. Yet,  advanced practitioners must adopt a critical approach to understanding the ways Telecare is being implemented, evaluated and used, to ensure innovative practice remains needs led rather than technology driven.This course offers students an opportunity to acquire knowledge and skills with which to examine Telecare 'solutions' and tools to critique its use. It offers an insight into current trends and future developments of assistive technologies, whilst highlighting the benefits as well as the risks to service users, healthcare providers and society as a whole.",
    "course_description": "Over the course of 10 weeks the online course is covering three main themes:1.  The technology: examining Telecare solutions and exploring user centred design.2.  The home: critiquing the transformation of the domestic environment into a smart extension of a care environment.3.  The practice: exploring issues around an evidence based approach, ethics and potential risks to service users and providers of health and care services.To support a vibrant community of learners, students are asked to contribute to a weekly discussion board and have an opportunity to engage with the course leader regularly. For this 10 credit course students are expected to spend 100 hours of learning.By the end of the course the student should have acquired the skills to:Evaluate different types (generations) of assistive technologies and identify implementation methods for devices that support independent living;Summarise and critically assess the existing empirical evidence regarding Telecare evaluations;Chart the transformation pathway of the home from a caring domestic environment to a 'smart' extension of a care facility;Explore the potential of embedding Telecare as part of a holistic care package, which addresses the effects of social isolation in older adults.",

These topics will change in order to keep up-to-date with changing patterns of disease and global health concerns but example topics for the course will include subject areas as diverse as: ageing health and long term conditions in a global world, refugee and migrant health, global mental health, communicable and non-communicable diseases, global digital health, and cancer.",

In addition, each health issue will be approached through a different research methodology, thereby introducing the students to a variety of different research methodologies commonly used in the field of health research. By considering research questions, methods of approach and key findings in relation to each health topic, students will build knowledge of each global health topic and also of a variety of research approaches.",

Once we have introduced core concepts to understand the embodied self, the reflexive self and the development of identity, in part two we will focus on health, illness and impairment. We will explore different sociological theories to explore how experiences of impairment and illness can disrupt, but also produce, our sense of self. Part three of the course will introduce different ill health experiences and disabilities (such as chronic illness, dementia, panic and self-harm) and examine these through different interdisciplinary lenses (counselling, clinical psychology, nursing, sociology).We will consider how we can understand each of these ill-health experiences, and how they can affect our sense of self and identity. In the fourth and final part of the course, we will look at the influence of wider systems and society more broadly. We will explore interactions within health and social care systems and discuss how these shape experiences of ill health and impairment.Organisational and societal responsesAn outline of contemporary responses to the perceived challenges of providing health and social care in a globalised and growing population. Issues covered include: patients as partners; empowerment and person-centred care.",

This intersectional, critical, social science course focuses on advocacy and the lived experience of disabled people.",
    "course_description": "This interdisciplinary course introduces you to the growing and important field of disability studies.  Recent events have drawn attention to the urgent need for societies to work towards ensuring that all people are enabled to participate fully and to be treated equitably at every level of social organisation.This course has a strong focus on the lived experience of disability and values the knowledge embodied in this experience.  It takes an explicit advocacy orientation, exploring the range of challenges experienced by disabled people locally, nationally and globally, while critically examining policies and interventions aimed at helping to reduce and eliminate barriers to full participation.  It also takes an intersectional approach, looking at how disability intersecting with other aspects of identity such as race, ethnicity, age and gender provide additional challenges that need to be taken into account in interventions aimed at eliminating inequities.As an interdisciplinary course, we welcome students with an interest in the topic from any and every part of the University to join us in discussing and learning about this important topic and in building an academic community in which no one is excluded.The voices of disabled people are at the centre of this course, providing students with the opportunity to learn from the embodied, lived experience of disability.  In order to deepen understandings of this lived experience and to develop critical capacities in relation to evaluating policies and interventions for improving access and participation for all, the course will introduce perspectives from a range of social science disciplines.  We will critically examine the different ways in which disability has been (and continues to be) defined and understood within and without the social sciences and how this impacts on lived experience.  The course is team taught and from year to year will cover a different range of additional topics, which might includeDisability in professional practice. How disability is approached across health and social-care practices and how this is experienced by disabled peopleNarratives of disability. How people story their lived experiences and how these stories come into conflict with and are shaped by other stories.Disability and gender.  How the intersections of gender and disability impact on lived experience and how taking an intersectional approach helps to improve advocacy, interventions and policy-makingDisability and design.  How can the design field and their approaches to disability help us to understand disability in the social sciencesDisability and technology.  How is technology changing the way disabled people participate in society?Care and disability.  Taking a feminist ethics approach to disability in society.The geography of disability.  How can human geography help us to understand the lived experience of disability?In keeping with best practices for accessible learning, the course will be delivered in a blended format, enabling flexible engagement on the part of students as needed.  This blended delivery includes on-campus teaching, which will be recorded and posted online, as well as online activities for everyone to engage in.  There will also be tutorial groups for pre-honours students and a weekly one-hour seminar for honours students.  Again, these will be delivered in a blended format, so that if students are unable to attend their group one week, they will be enabled to participate in some other capacity.All assessments will be coursework-based and are aimed at giving you an opportunity to focus on an area of disability studies of particular relevance to you while integrating your learning across the ten weeks of the programme.  In keeping of the advocacy orientation of this course, part of the assessment will be outward-facing, in the form of a blog-post.",

Priority is given to students on this degree programme.  It is designed to complement the second semester core course Identity and Experience in Health and Society through personal experience of engagement in the community with persons with needs which compromise their health.  The course offers students the opportunity to develop new skills and knowledge and enrich their learning experience through working on a voluntary basis for a non-profit organisation.  It is thus also an opportunity to develop civic responsibility and understanding of social ethics through a genuine contribution to local people's lives.  The organisations involved are deeply concerned with supporting vulnerable or disadvantaged people in our local community, and are offering full training and support for students who take this option.Please note:1. Initial meetings and training for voluntary roles take place in semester 1. Students interested in this course should contact the course organiser ideally before end October.  Places will NOT be available after end November.2.\tExpenses involved in taking this course:  printing costs for an academic poster; travel costs (local buses) may be needed to reach some volunteering locations.",
    "course_description": "This course offers practical real-life experience of assisting people with pressing needs improve their lives.  Through personal engagement with individuals, students will simultaneously be making a contribution to the quality of others' lives in our local community and enhancing their understanding of situated individual experience and its consequences on health and daily living.  Hands-on activity will be integrated with academic work to provide an innovative learning opportunity that will deepen appreciation of academic course materials while developing life and employability skills.Students taking this option course will be introduced to a hosting non-profit organisation (NPO) in semester 1 where, with oversight from the course organiser, a package of work will be agreed. The precise nature of the work may vary according to NPO, but will involve supporting the work of the organisation, often through sustained personal contact with specified users of the organisation's services. This will involve the ability to establish supportive and friendly working relationships according to the requirements of the immediate context.All necessary training, supervision and support will be provided by the NPO, but students will be required to maintain contact with a designated member of the course team.  Alongside the practical work, students will undertake regular independent study activities of reading, writing and critical reflection designed to support understanding of the relationship between academic study of materials and actual life experience.The timetable for the practical work involved in this course will be flexible, depending on student timetables and the requirements of the voluntary work undertaken.  Although most work will be carried out independently, there will be ten class meetings through the semester which will provide a formal point of contact and support towards achieving the learning objectives.  These are a required element of the course.Initial meetings between the participating student and the NPO will take place in semester 1, so that students are prepared and confident to start work at the beginning of semester 2.Initial training for the voluntary work agreed will be given by the hosting NPO.  Learning will take place through contributions to the services provided by the NPO in the local community throughout the semester.  There will also be 10 classroom sessions to discuss the work and experiences of students and to guide reading and reflection in relation to academic materials, and a system of support offered by the course team.The student will be expected to develop and maintain contact with the non-profit organisation (NPO), attend training as required and participate in their system of supervision.  She or he will be required to complete around 36 hours of dedicated time as planned in conjunction with the NPO and course director, across the 12 weeks of semester 2.Developmental activity will be embedded in the course through regular writing of a reflective diary throughout the semester, and this will support the writing of the final summative assignment (70%), which will take the form of an essay.   Other summative assessment will take the form of a poster (30%).  Formative assessment will take the form of the presentation of draft posters in class but ahead of the submission deadline, and this will allow guided peer sharing and learning through class discussion to support learning outcomes, enhance appreciation of experiential learning and confidence in completing the summative assessments.  This will give students direct feedback/feed forward from peers and the tutor on their work in preparation for the summative poster, and provide orientation towards the written assignment.",

In this course, we engage in an in-depth exploration of the wider ways in which society shapes understandings and experiences of, and responses to, mental health and illness.The course is delivered by a multi-disciplinary team of experts within the School of Health in Social Science, and seeks to introduce students to social scientific approaches to explaining, understanding and responding to mental health and illness. The course draws heavily on the sociology of health and illness, as well as anthropology, geography, critical mental health, mad studies and disability studies. Ultimately, the course seeks to challenge students to think about mental health and illness differently, and to ask questions about taken for granted aspects of how mental health and illness are represented and treated, as well as commonly held ideas about the causes of mental health and illnessMental health is a rapidly growing area of concern for policy makers, health services, and wider society. Historically, mental health has been seen as secondary to physical health, and there are enduring inequalities in how funding for health services is distributed. However, with greater interest and urgency around developing more effective and equitable responses to mental health, comes a greater need for social scientific approaches to mental health to be more widely understood.The course will cover:- key approaches and challenges with defining and measuring mental illness;- understanding and explaining inequalities in mental illness;- critically assessing treatment approaches - considering 'whole society', community-based, and peer-led support - addressing how this plays out in diverse global contexts;- addressing stigma as a dominant model for understanding and responding to mental illness;- considering survivor-led, 'mad studies' and non-medical ways of understanding mental illness.Each week, an introductory lecture will set out the topic and give a basic grounding. This is followed by a midweek tutorial that presents a problem or issue that students will discuss, debate, or engage in a creative activity in order to explore. During the tutorial, tutors (with student input where possible) will upload feedback or insights to discussion boards in Learn, these will then provide material for revision and further learning, as well as being drawn on in the second lecture of the week. The second lecture each week will build on the learning from the first lecture and tutorials, deepening students' understanding. Content for the second lecture each week will not be reliant on student engagement in tutorials, but will be enhanced by it.",

    "summary": "The aim of this course is to introduce students to the concept of drug policy, explore how it is enacted both internationally and nationally, and invites critical reflection on policy responses to drug use. It combines perspectives drawn from health studies, law, criminology, social policy, sociology, public health and public policy to explore the interaction between drug use and society, and the role that risk and harm play in the development of a public good approach to drug use.",
    "course_description": "This course brings together a range of academic disciplines and literature to give students a broad understanding of drug policy, both international and national. While drug use and policy may be discussed as part of other courses, this is the only course that focuses specifically on drug policy, and the impact it has on society today.Drug policy is becoming increasingly visible as an important component of both health and legal policy. Around the world there are shifts which see drug policy moving to a health matter, and the contradictions that can have in the development and delivery of criminal justice and public health frameworks. The aim of the course will be to explore both criminal justice and public health approaches to drug policy, and will introduce students to the broader concept of a 'public good' approach.This course will be divided into three blocks:1.\tDrug use and Society: this block will look at why people use drugs, and explore the interaction between risk, harm, health andmorality in the development of drug policy. This section will have a sociological and health based focus.2.\tDrug policy frameworks: this set of lectures will introduce students to international and national drug policy frameworks,including regulations and legislation on the production, trafficking, supply, possession and use of illicit substances, and recentmoves towards decriminalization and legalization of drugs. This section will have a legal and public policy focus.3.\tPublic good approaches: this block will look at public good approaches to drug use, including how this interacts with bothpublic health and criminal justice approaches to drug use. Within this students will explore new and innovative uses for illicitdrugs in the treatment of depression, trauma and addiction. This section will have a social policy, legal and health based focus.Students will be expected to attend a weekly lecture and 1 tutorial per week, but there will be a range of online activities to develop and complete in addition to this. Drug use has become an important part of media and entertainment, and we will be looking at films, documentaries and online content to explore the narratives driving drug policy, and develop deeper understandings of how these narratives impact individuals and society.The assessments will provide several ways in which students can demonstrate their learning outcomes.Formative Assessment (not marked):An in class exercise where you will mark another students work and discuss. More details in class.The essay will allow you to expand on a topic covered in the first four weeks in greater detail.With the policy brief students will show that they understand the topic, and will be supported to develop a policy brief that highlights the tensions between public health and criminal justice approaches to drug use.",

In doing so it will give them a deeper understanding of the complexity surrounding evidence based health policy, criminal justice policy, and social attitudes to what can be termed 'wicked problems'.The course will also complement professional and academic learning across the School of Health in Social Science by introducing drug policy as a health issue. This in turn will enhance students' understanding of the complexity surrounding health issues that are also governed by criminal justice interventions - similar to recent Covid restrictions. As a result students will develop the attributes of being creative and critical researchers and thinkers, promoting confidence and courage to expand and fulfill their potential.Feedback from single lectures that have been delivered on other courses, but utilize this course content, have shown that students are introduced to ideas and material they have not come across before, and often this relates to personal experiences of problem drug use with family or friends. As a result there is an increase in understanding and compassion towards those suffering from drug dependencies, as well a wider acceptance of behavior which may not be desirable, but additionally may not be suitable to criminal interventions. As can be seen from the feedback, this will often give them the passion to engage both locally and globally on this very relevant topic.Finally, the assessment (both formative and summative) will enhance their learning by providing a space for them to become skilled communicators, and encourage them to be effective and influential contributors both in class and in their future career.",

This is a compulsory course for students in the third year of the MA (Hons) in Health, Science and Society.",
    "course_description": "This course focuses on ethical practice in the caring professions. Compassion in caring will constitute a key theme through the course. Starting from an overview of the philosophical foundations of professional ethics, students will examine key debates around universality and context-dependence in professional ethics. The course will explain how moral reasoning related to professional practice goes beyond the entirely rational and requires the capacity for empathic engagement with others. Students will also apply the concept of professional wisdom to ethical practice. Through this exploration, students will gain an awareness of their personal ethics and values. Particular ethical principles relating to care and treatment will be explored, including beneficence, autonomy, self-determination, informed consent, confidentiality, human rights, dignity, respect and professional fidelity. Students will analyse the strengths and limitations of various professional ethical codes by applying them to complex ethical case studies. Ethical issues relating to the vulnerable service user/patient will be examined, including ethical challenges in relation to capacity and decision-making in the context of mental health, dementia, end of life care, critical care, childhood and intellectual disability. Key research will be introduced to extend discussion and to include a focus on how ethical practice and decision-making may be researched and informed through research.With its interdisciplinary focus, this course will benefit students from a range of backgrounds and with various career aspirations. While using examples from UK professional codes and contexts, discussion will focus on general principles and values of relevance to both UK and international students. Students will examine their personal ethical values and understand how the personal and the professional are intertwined in ethical caring practice. The course draws on the research and scholarship being undertaken by members of the School of Health in Social Science in relation to ethics in the caring professions.",

What does it mean to be a health manager?- Leadership from without (e.g. leading a group, leading others)- Leadership from within (e.g. personal mastery, alignment)- The role of creativity and values in effective leadership2. What is does it mean to be well?- Intellectual and theoretical understandings of health and well being- Understanding of health and well being in relation to the 'self', 'others' and the bigger picture (empathy and systems thinking)- Listening and learning - where intellect meets empathy - what works and what doesn't3. What is good decision-making?- What counts as evidence- Collecting and integrating different types of data- Role of communication (methods used and their impact / effectiveness, understanding your 'audience' and speaking in their language)The final session will guide students to critically reflect on what they have learned in this course and how it can be applied in real-world settings, emphasising the link between theory and practice.",

    "course_description": "Experiences and understandings of health, illness, wellness, disease and death are irrevocably tied to human bodies; yet the body has been problematized considerably by social scientific theorization and research. This course shows how social scientific work on bodies and embodiment (how people live in/with/as their bodies) offers vital resources through which to critically consider the ways in which (embodied) health is shaped by societal structures, meanings and practices. Students are introduced to a range of social scientific perspectives on bodies and embodiment, and will learn to critically apply these to understanding human health, including a consideration of health experience, health care and health research.Topics covered are likely to include: symbolic, constructed and lived bodies in health and illness; the construction of race, ethnicity, sex and gender in healthcare practice and research; how embodied metaphors shape understandings of human health and ill-health, normality and abnormality.The course uses blended learning incorporating weekly 2 hour seminars and online activities. Seminars combine formal lectures with student led activity. Full participation in online and offline class activity is essential. Students are supported to develop a critical understanding of social scientific theories of bodies and embodiment, and to apply these in a sustained study of a particular health condition.Students will evidence and demonstrate achievement of Learning Outcomes via engagement in online/offline class activity, Formative and Summative assessments.",

    "course_description": "This interdisciplinary course introduces students to the growing and important field of disability studies.  Recent events have drawn attention to the urgent need for societies to work towards ensuring that all people are enabled to participate fully and to be treated equitably at every level of social organisation.This course has a strong focus on the lived experience of disability and values the knowledge embodied in this experience.  It takes an explicit advocacy orientation,  exploring the range of challenges experienced by disabled people locally, nationally and globally, while critically examining policies and interventions aimed at helping to reduce and eliminate barriers to full participation.  It also takes an intersectional approach, looking at how disability intersecting with other aspects of identity such as race, ethnicity, age and gender provide additional challenges that need to be taken into account in interventions aimed at eliminating inequities.As an interdisciplinary course, we welcome students with an interest in the topic from any and every part of the University to join us in discussing and learning about this important topic and in building an academic community in which no one is excluded.The voices of disabled people are at the centre of this course, providing students with the opportunity to learn from the embodied, lived experience of disability.  In order to deepen understandings of this lived experience and to develop critical capacities in relation to evaluating policies and interventions for improving access and participation for all, the course will introduce perspectives from a range of social science disciplines.  We will critically examine the different ways in which disability has been (and continues to be) defined and understood within and without the social sciences and how this impacts on lived experience.  The course is team taught and from year to year will cover a different range of additional topics, which might include:;Disability in professional practice. How disability is approached across health and social-care practices and how this is experienced by disabled peopleNarratives of disability. How people story their lived experiences and how these stories come into conflict with and are shaped by other stories.Disability and gender.  How the intersections of gender and disability impact on lived experience and how taking an intersectional approach helps to improve advocacy, interventions and policy-makingDisability and design.  How can the design field and their approaches to disability help us to understand disability in the social sciencesDisability and technology.  How is technology changing the way disabled people participate in society?Care and disability.  Taking a feminist ethics approach to disability in society.The geography of disability.  How can human geography help us to understand the lived experience of disability?In keeping with best practices for accessible learning, the course will be delivered in a blended format, enabling flexible engagement on the part of students as needed.  This blended delivery includes on-campus teaching, which will be recorded and posted online, as well as online activities for everyone to engage in.  There will also be tutorial groups for pre-honours students and a weekly one-hour seminar for honours students.  Again, these will be delivered in a blended format, so that if students are unable to attend their group one week, they will be enabled to participate in some other capacity.All assessments will be coursework-based and are aimed at giving students the opportunity to focus on an area of disability studies of particular relevance, while integrating learning across the ten weeks of the programme.  In keeping of the advocacy orientation of this course, part of the assessment will be outward-facing, in the form of a blog-post.",

This course will take a living labs approach to studying the ways in which gardens, parks, flora, fauna, and biodiversity more generally may impact on the health of humans and human communities. We will use a social justice lens in our study, examining how access and engagement with nature and the outdoors is unequally distributed within communities and how environmental injustice may contribute to the observed correlation between social inequality and health inequality.",
    "course_description": "Each year, students on the course will be presented with a real-world problem to work on in the local area. In 2018-2019, the topic explored was be how biodiversity impacts on human health in relation to University of Edinburgh greenspaces.The course will meet twice a week over the ten weeks of teaching.  The first meeting of the week will be delivered seminar-style in a classroom.  The second meeting will be longer (2 hours) and will involve a range of activities from group work to site visits and fieldwork.  Any costs involved in fieldtrips, such as public transit fares, will need to be covered by students.During the first week of class, you will be briefed on the issue to be addressed.  You will be supported in developing a learning plan for yourself and a collective learning plan with your classmates, which will provide the roadmap for the work that you undertake to prepare yourselves for and implement a strategy for investigating the problem and proposing potential ways to address it. During the last week of class, you will present your findings and your proposed interventions to relevant community members.  The final report will be due during the exam period.The course will be student-led, meaning that you will collectively set the direction of study and research, with the course organiser and associated staff providing support and acting as resources for learning. Group work will play a significant part in your learning and assessment.  Two of the learning outcomes concern your ability to work in a group context. Support and resources will be provided throughout the course to enable you to develop and hone your group-work skills.You will be assessed both individually and as a group. Individually, your attendance, participation and awareness and evidence of how you worked in and contributed to the group and to group assessments will be assessed. Collectively, as a group you will be assessed on your ability to identify, define, conceptualise and analyse a real world problem and execute a defined project of research to address that problem. You will also be assessed collectively on your abilities to present your findings to an informed audience.This course will provide you with the opportunity to further your academic learning, your critical thinking skills and your employability, it will also enable you to make a positive difference in your local community and in the world right now.",

This debate plays out over the duration of the course, and draws in the 'individual' context of being an individual and the 'community' context of wider society and policy.A second axis of debate addresses the triple dimensions of time, place and person (including the role of green spaces, environment, cultural relationships, the place of religion etc). We will do this though exploration of individual neighbourhoods - exploring neighbourhoods as global yet local places in which we play out our lives and identifying ways in which they impact positively and negatively on our health and mental wellbeing.Located in the final semester of the programme, the course will extend prior learning into a place that is both familiar (our neighbourhoods) and unfamiliar (analysing this place of familiarity through the lenses of individual / community and time / place / person). Students will analyse a neighbourhood of their own choosing and this can be from anywhere in the world, enabling the students to take into subsequent employment an ability to analyse global issues at a local level.",

    "course_description": "This course will be offered as an option to students undertaking the MSc Advanced Nursing programme as well as other similar masters courses (e.g. public health, physical activity and health, psychology).The challenges that students will face in their careers are becoming more complex and interrelated, for example wicked problems and syndemics.  These challenges necessitate similarly complex interventions, and this course will provide students with the knowledge and skills to evaluate challenges and develop appropriate interventions.  Within the course the students will be walked through the 6 Steps for Quality Intervention Develop (6SQuID), by some of the team who developed this process.  6SQuID has been recommended by funders like the UKRI as an intervention development process.  The six steps are:1.\tUnderstanding the problem and its causes2.\tIdentifying modifiable causal factors3.\tIdentifying how to bring about change (theory of change)4.\tIdentifying how to deliver change mechanisms (theory of action)5.\tTesting and adaptive the intervention6.\tCollecting sufficient evidence of effectiveness to proceed to a rigorous evaluationThese six steps will be taught over 10 weeks, with 1 hour of lecture followed by 1 hour of workshop most weeks.  Within the workshops the students will apply the material from the lecture developing their own theoretical intervention, with support and feedback from the course organisers.  Initially, the students will work in small groups (3-4 members) to develop an intervention for a challenge of their choosing.  They will then present the logic model/programme theory (the combination of the theories of action and change) for their intervention for formative feedback, before separating to work on individual evaluation plans for their intervention.  The classroom experiences will be supplemented with reading and other material (e.g. videos) on the course topic.  The workshops will be opportunities for the students to work in their groups to implement the material from the preceding lecture, with input from the course staff, providing additional formative feedback.The course will primarily be delivered by members of the Scottish Collaboration for Public Health Research and Policy, who regularly apply the 6SQuID model with a variety of stakeholders.  This will give the students the opportunity to learn from a wide range of case studies.  Alongside Andrew Williams, the course organisation and delivery will be supported by Divya Sivaramakrishnan and Larry Doi.N.B.

The students will be taught these concepts within the R environment and will be given 3 course datasets to engage with during the course.The course will provide an R-recipe-book to students for easy access of R code.",
    "course_description": "This postgraduate course will equip students to have a critical understanding of  the core principles of quantitative data analysis within a modern and versatile statistical software, R.  The course will enable students to conduct basic descriptive and inferential statistical tests on their data and will instill an extensive understanding of the underlying assumptions for each test.   Additionally, students will be introduced to regression modelling at a basic level. Students who wish to use quantitative methods in research or in postgraduate study will have a firm footing in quantitative data analysis.Students will be introduced to (i) data analysis in research (ii) the importance of having clear research questions (iii) data cleaning and manipulation (iv) descriptive data analysis (v) inferential data analysis (including regression modeling) (vi) recipes in R, and (vii) scientific communication.The course will be provided over 10 weeks.  Each lecture will be followed by a practical on the following week.  Students will engage in peer learning during the practical sessions and will be given the opportunity to analyse data from 3 different scenarios and will be taught how to simulate their own data. Some of these will include data from common study designs such as pre-post designs.  The incorporation of R programming in the course will be done in a spiral approach: at first, students will copy R code into the online interface to generate output.  Gradually, they will be introduced to opportunities where they type in their own code.",
