    "summary": "Calculus is one of the most fundamental tools in mathematics and its applications. This course presents an introduction to the two main branches of calculus: differential calculus and integral calculus. At the heart of both lies the notion of the limit of a function, sequence, or series. In addition to promoting a conceptual appreciation of these foundations of calculus, the course will develop calculational facility, both of which are essential for further mathematical study.A suggested syllabus for the course is as follows. Functions. Limits and continuity. Differentiation: techniques and applications. Inverse functions. Integration: techniques and applications. Fundamental theorem of calculus. Sequences and series. Taylor and Maclaurin series. Differential equations, moments, and exponential growth.",
    "course_description": "It is probably fair to say that calculus represents one of the biggest achievements in the history of human thought. It took mankind almost two millennia to go from Archimedes first attempts to estimate areas to the birth of the subject as we know it today with the work of Newton and Leibniz in the 1600s and even after that it took another two centuries before the foundations of the subject were firmly laid.In that sense, calculus marks the birth of modern mathematics: its influence on scientific and technological developments over the centuries since its inception cannot be overstated. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to calculus; the focus will be firmly on the two traditional branches: differential calculus and integral calculus. Roughly speaking, the former is concerned with rates of change (\"derivatives\"), while the latter studies accumulated quantities (\"integrals\"). The connection between the two is established by the fundamental theorem of calculus which lies at the heart of the subject, and which in turn relies on the notion of the limit of a function.The course will explore some of the implications of these and related notions, and will cover a variety of techniques and applications of both differentiation and integration; examples include the mean value theorem, curve sketching, and (unconstrained or constrained) optimisation, as well as areas and volumes, arc length, and improper integrals. The convergence of infinite sequences and series will be another focus in the course. Further applications may include (elementary) differential equations from physics, ecology, and engineering, moments from probability theory, and growth models from economicsDepending on the mode of delivery, lectures or screencasts on assigned reading will be augmented through (formal and informal) collaborative discussion, thus implementing a \"flipped classroom\" setting. Real-time workshops will involve group-based activities to cement concepts, and expand on applications introduced in lectures or screencasts. Opportunities for practice will be provided through worksheets, online quizzes, and biweekly written homework.",

We are surrounded by important questions involving chance but our intuition on the subject is often wrong. This course aims to give an understanding of the subject that will help you understand issues where chance plays a central role as well as preparing you for further study.The course covers fundamental concepts and basic examples, assuming no previous knowledge of the subject. Some knowledge of calculus and basic combinatorics and set theory is assumed.The central topics will include:- Fundamentals of mathematical probability: sample spaces; events; independence; conditional probability and Bayes' Theorem. Discrete and continuous distributions.- Random variables: expectation; variance; sums and products.- Fundamental distributions: uniform; normal; binomial, geometric, Poisson, exponential and their applications.- The idea and applications of the central limit theorem.",

Facility comes only with practice, and students will be expected to engage with many problems during the course.The principal areas of study which are both essential foundations to Mathematics and which serve to develop the skills mentioned above are sets and functions, and number systems and their fundamental properties.",

This course extends the study of ODEs and PDEs started in earlier courses by introducing several ideas and techniques that enable the construction of explicit exact or approximate solutions.  Assessment is by assignments and final examination.",
    "course_description": "Integral transforms often provide solutions through integral representations. The integrals involved are nontrivial and need to be approximated using asymptotic expansions that take advantage of large or small parameters. The first part of the course discusses both integral transform methods and asymptotic techniques for the approximation of the resulting integrals. A second part introduces asymptotic techniques for the direct approximation of solution of ODEs. The final part of the course focuses on PDEs. It introduces important techniques for the solution of several classes of linear PDEs (heat and wave equation) and nonlinear PDEs (first-order). The concept of shock waves, familiar from supersonic flight and fluid flow, is introduced.  The fitting of shock and expansion waves into the solution of nonlinear hyperbolic pde's is dealt with in detail.  Examples are drawn from traffic flow, supersonic fluid flow and erosion.Part 1: Asymptotics and integral transforms.(1) integral transforms: Laplace and Fourier (partly revision)(2) asymptotic expansion: definitions and notations.(3) asymptotic methods for integrals: Watson's lemma, the Laplace method, saddle point method, method of stationary phase.Part 2: ODEs(4) regular and singular perturbations(5) WKB approximations: first approximations(6) boundary value problems: boundary layersPart 3: PDEs(7) first order PDEs: quasilinear, characteristics, shocks.(8) waves and diffusion(9) Green's functions(10) waves in space(11) eigenvalue problems",

    "summary": "Many systems include some unpredictability, and this unpredictability is typically modelled through the addition of \"noise\". Stochastic differential equations are a generalization of ordinary differential equations, allowing an additional noise term to be introduced.This course introduces stochastic differential equations. Starting first from their definition, through the introduction of the Ito stochastic integral, the course develops techniques for studying the properties of the stochastic processes defined by these equations, and considers the analytic solution of some simple cases. The course further introduces numerical methods which can be used to seek approximate solutions, describing how to define the numerical error in a numerical approximation of a stochastic process. The course further considers links between stochastic differential equations and partial differential equations.",

    "summary": "Classical mechanics deals with the mathematical description of the motion of bodies, or point-like objects. By understanding the forces that are exerted on a body we can construct Newton's equation that describes the motion of the object in question. There are however, other mathematical approaches to this class of problems, known as the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian descriptions of classical mechanics. This course will introduce these various perspectives, and in the process cover the subject of the calculus of variations. Furthermore this course is the first in a series of mathematical physics courses, such as Quantum Mechanics, Classical Field theory, Quantum Information, Geometry of General Relativity and Topics in Mathematical Physics A/B.",
    "course_description": "This course is an introduction to the subject of classical mechanics. It will cover Newton's equation, the motion of point particles, including planetary motion, and an introduction to the notion of variational calculus for point particles. In particular the course will cover Hamilton's principle of least action, Lagrangians for systems with conservative forces, and Noether's theorem. The latter provides a conserved quantity whenever there exists a continuous symmetry. Finally, an introduction to the Hamiltonian formalism will be given which prepares the ground for the follow-up course on quantum mechanics for mathematicians. The classical mechanics for mathematicians course is a great opportunity to learn about many classical differential equations and physical problems that helped shape many developments in mathematics. It is also a nice arena to practise one's knowledge of several variable calculus and differential equations.The course will include the following topics:- Newton's equations for simple mechanical systems- Celestial mechanics- Lagrangians and Euler-Lagrange equations-  Noether's theorem and continuous symmetries- Hamiltonians and Hamilton's equations- Poisson brackets",

The second semester will include two or three workshops, and will be mostly dedicated to the design and delivery of a project. A project will consist of a specific package of Maths outreach and engagement, designed for and in collaboration with a specific client. Clients may include schools, museums, local libraries or local communities. Researchers within the School and University, or even the Mathematics Outreach Team, may also act as clients in relation to the communication (impact) of their research programmes to appropriate audiences. Outputs will be diverse, and may include, for example, exhibits, workshops or presentations to be delivered in schools, work with local communities, online activities and digital apps to be posted on the School of Mathematics website.

    "summary": "This course will be an introduction to commutative algebra, mainly focusing on methods to work with polynomial rings. The course begins with the abstract foundations of commutative algebra including the Noetherian and Hilbert's basis theorem. After the foundations are established the course focuses on practical methods for solving systems of polynomial equations. An important branch of algebra in its own right, commutative algebra is an essential tool to explore several other areas of mathematics, such as algebraic geometry, number theory, Galois theory, Lie theory, and non-commutative algebra.",
    "course_description": "The course begins by reviewing and building upon the elementary ring theory seen Honours Algebra. The material will include (but is not limited to) integral domains, unique factorisation domains, Noetherian rings, Hilbert's basis theorem, prime and maximal ideals. This builds the necessary foundations for the second part of course and allows for transparent connections with other areas of mathematics.The course then moves to develop methods to solve systems of polynomial equations. In linear algebra you learnt to solve systems of linear equations in many variables. You probably have encountered a few methods so far to find the zeroes of univariate polynomials. in this course we consider the more general case of systems of polynomial equations with many variables and arbitrary degree. Such sets equations come up naturally - in kinematics, robotics, physics, statistics, biology, optimization, etc. A key tool in the solution to this problem is Buchberger's algorithm and Groebner bases.There is a close relationship to geometry in this class: we will discuss Hilbert's nullstellensatz which shows how solution sets to polynomial equations are the building blocks of algebraic varieties, the objects studied in algebraic geometry. This class will provide some concrete examples of the concepts you have learnt in Honours Algebra and give you tools to do computations with them.",

It starts by making an introduction to the value of money, interest rates and financial contracts, in particular, what are fair prices for contracts and why no-one uses fair prices in real life. Then, there is a review of probability theory followed by an introduction to financial markets in discrete time. In discrete time, one will see how the ideas of fair pricing apply to price contracts commonly found in stock exchanges. The next block focuses on continuous time finance and contains an introduction to the basic ideas of Stochastic calculus. This course is a great introduction to finance theory and its purpose is to give students a broad perspective on the topic.\"",

    "course_description": "Dynamic Optimisation is a neat way of solving sequential decision problems based on recursion. Its power comes from the fact that some important classes of optimisation problems that \"ought to be difficult\" can be reformulated as a recursive optimisation problem and thus made tractable. Examples are network optimisation problems, allocation problems and inventory problems.Integer Optimisation provides a general method of solving problems with logical or integrality constraints. Solution methods include Branch-and-Bound and Gomory Cuts. Much emphasis will be placed on how to express various types of restrictions that may appear in optimisation problems (like logical conditions) can be expressed using integer variables.Game Theory is concerned with mathematical modelling of behaviour and optimal decision making in competitive strategic situations in which the success of strategic choices of one individual (person, company, server, ...) depends on the choices of other (intelligent) \"players\" that each have their own (possibly conflicting) agenda.Note that Dynamic Optimisation and Integer Optimisation were historically called \"Dynamic Programming\" and \"Integer Programming\" respectively (the term \"programming\" in these words did not mean \"computer programming\" but rather decision making).Dynamic OptimisationMultistage decision processes; principle of optimality. Applications: network problems; inventory problem; resource allocation problem; knapsack problem; stochastic problems.Integer OptimisationModelling: set-up costs, batch production, limited number of production methods. Logical constraints; set covering problems; systematic conversion of logical expression to IP constraints. Solution techniques: branch and bound; Gomory pure integer cuts.Game TheoryOptimal strategies in face of uncertainty (minimax and maximin). Two-person zero sum games, dominated strategies, saddle points, non=zero sum games, reaction curves and Nash equilibria.",

The rest of the course will then develop the classic theory of surfaces. This will be done in the modern language of differential forms. Surfaces possess a notion of intrinsic geometry and many of the more advanced aspects of differential geometry can be demonstrated in this simpler context. One of the main aims will be to quantify the notions of curvature and shape of surfaces. The culmination of the course will be the introduction of the hyperbolic plane, and a sketch proof of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, a profound result which relates the curvature of surfaces to their topology.Syllabus:Curves in Euclidean space: regularity, velocity, arc-length, Frenet-Serret frame, curvature and torsion, equivalence problem.Calculus in R^n: tangent vectors, vector fields, differential forms, moving frames, connection forms, structure equations.Surfaces in Euclidean space: regularity, first and second fundamental forms, curvatures (principal, mean, Gauss), isometry, Gauss's Theorema Egregium, geodesics on surfaces, the hyperbolic plane, integration of forms, statement of Stokes' theorem, Euler characteristic, Gauss-Bonnet theorem (sketch proof).",

    "summary": "This course showcases the power showcases the power of abstraction and brings together several different topics from earlier courses as well as new ideas, in order to present a view on some of the more advanced algebra that is critical for later courses and also in application, as well as of interest in its own right. The course also includes computer algebra, to support and illustrate some of the content.",
    "course_description": "One great power of mathematics is abstraction. Here abstraction is the distillation of a mathematical idea to its essence - in the case of linear algebra, understanding what unifies points, lines and planes, and so on. This turns out to be very useful. Why? Well two apparently different ideas can turn out to have the same underlying structure, and then insight you get from one can reveal the other. Think of a dictionary, allowing you to translate the masterpieces of one language into another. [Of course, you still need to work hard to make a good translation.] Second, it is often easier to understand general structure than it is to understand specific examples. Many mathematicians think \"if you can't answer a particular question, generalise it - it might become easier!\". This course is about showcasing this, as well as giving you a solid base for more advanced topics in Year 4 and beyond. It also emphasises connections with other parts of mathematics, and will feature applications of the theory to problems, sometimes even beyond mathematics.The syllabus first covers abstract vector spaces and linear transformations. It then introduces rings and modules, their quotients, and the first isomorphism theorem. The multilinear algebra of determinants is studied, together with eigenvectors and eigenvalues, culminating in the Cayley-Hamilton theorem and the Perron-Frobenius Theorem. This is followed by an introduction to inner product spaces and the Spectral Theorem. The course then moves on to normal forms for linear transformations and particularly the Jordan Normal Form.Throughout the course, we will also work with a computer algebra system to learn about programming skills and data structures which are useful in Pure Mathematics and beyond. We will use these skills to investigate topics that are relevant to the theory being developed.Linear Algebra1. Basic concepts in abstract linear algebra, abstract vector spaces, bases, linear maps, dimension, images and kernels.2. Linear transformations, choice of basis, Smith normal form.Rings and Modules1. Basic definitions and examples of rings, homomorphisms, kernels, images.2. Polynomials, their Euclidean algorithm, roots and algebraically closed fields.3. Basic definitions and examples of modules, homomorphisms, kernels, images.4. Quotient rings, modules and vector spaces; the first isomorphism theorem.Determinants and Eigenvalues1. Multilinear forms; characterisations of determinant.2. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors; diagonalisable and triangularisable linear mappings; Cayley-Hamilton Theorem.3. Perron-Frobenius Theorem and applications.Inner Product Spaces1. Basic definitions and examples of inner product spaces.2. Orthogonal projection; Gram-Schmidt.3. Adjoints of linear transformations; spectral theorem for finite dimensional inner product spaces.Jordan Normal Form1. The Jordan Normal Form.2. Applications of the Jordan Normal Form.",

    "course_description": "From Newton's laws of motion, to Maxwell's equations of electrodynamics and Einstein's equations of relativity, Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) provide a mathematical language to describe the physical world. It is perhaps less known that PDEs have been the driving force behind a large part of Analysis. The theory of Fourier series was first developed in an attempt to solve the wave and heat equations. A large part of the modern theory of Integration was developed in order to make rigorous sense of the integrals that appear in the formulas defining the Fourier coefficients. More recently, a stunning success of geometric PDEs was Perelman's proof of the Poincare conjecture, a long-standing problem in Topology, using the Ricci flow.This course is a rigorous introduction to the wave, heat, and Laplace equations. These are the prototypes of hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic equations, the three main types of PDEs. We'll investigate under what conditions solutions exist and whether or not they are unique. We'll also study some of the basic properties of solutions such as finite speed of propagation, the Huygens principle and conservation of energy. These properties originate in Physics but have powerful mathematical expressions that allow us to develop rigorously a large part of the theory of PDEs.",

This course introduces the concepts of LP modelling, explores the mathematical properties of general LP problems and studies the theory of the simplex algorithm as a solution technique. The novel feature of this course is that it introduces the Xpress mathematical programming system to create, solve and analyse case studies. The course ends with a group-based case study in which, much like an OR consultant might do, you will model, solve and analyse a meaningful example, presenting your work in oral and written form.Syllabus1. Linear programming: Decision variables, objective function, bounds and constraints. The feasible region; geometric and algebraic characterisation of an optimal solution. The dual of an LP problem and duality theory. Theory underlying sensitivity and fair prices.2. Modelling: Introduction to the Xpress mathematical programming system as a means of modelling, solving and analysing LP case studies. Exploration of the modelling language Mosel to define index sets, data arrays, decision variables, constraints, solve LP problems, analyse problem sensitivity and report the results in a suitable format for further processing using Excel.3.

The utility of these models will be showcased in a variety of applications which may include population biology, gene expression, mathematical physiology, enzyme kinetics, virus dynamics, and neuronal modelling.Substantial use will be made of ordinary differential equations and, to a lesser extent, of complex variables; the course hence builds on Honours Differential Equations (MATH10066) and Honours Complex Variables (MATH10067).A suggested syllabus for the course is as follows. Continuous and discrete population models. Perturbations and bifurcations. Interacting populations. Oscillators and switches. Chemical reaction kinetics. Disease dynamics. Reaction-diffusion equations. Waves and fronts. Spatial patterns.",
    "course_description": "The history of mathematical biology dates back at least to the 1100s, when Fibonacci described the growth of rabbit populations in terms of what is now known as Fibonacci series. Early applied mathematicians focussed mostly on the modelling of population and disease: in the 1700s, Bernoulli modelled the spread of smallpox, while Malthus popularised the concept of exponential growth. Applications in evolutional ecology followed in the 1800s, when MÃ¼ller investigated mimicry in light of natural selection, thus influencing the later works of Darwin.The field of mathematical biology has since grown considerably, and diverged into a number of specialised areas beyond the traditional ones of ecology and epidemiology. Mathematical modelling has become an indispensable tool in the biomedical sciences as the latter have become increasingly quantitative; in that sense, mathematical biology is a truly interdisciplinary discipline. The focus of this course will be on practical applications of dynamical models which take the form of difference or (ordinary and partial) differential equations. The applications covered may include Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics, front propagation in reaction-diffusion equations, competition in predator-prey systems, expression in gene regulatory networks, the dynamics of disease, or relaxation oscillation in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model.Lectures on assigned reading will be augmented through (formal and informal) collaborative discussion, thus implementing a \"flipped classroom\" setting. Workshops will involve group-based activities to cement concepts and expand on applications introduced in lectures. Opportunities for practice will be provided through worksheets, online quizzes, and biweekly written homework. Additional support may be available through drop-in office hours or an online discussion forum.",

In addition, during Semester 1, students work in small groups to plan and deliver lessons on a given topic to an appropriate audience (e.g. local school pupils). In the second semester students will engage with the research related to the teaching and learning of mathematics at the university level and will be encouraged to relate their own experience as learners to the research findings that will be discussed through readings and other activities each week.The course will consider questions such as: 'What is mathematics?', 'Why do we teach mathematics?', 'How do people learn mathematics?', 'How should mathematics be taught?', 'How can we assess mathematical understanding?', 'What motivates mathematics learning', What are the issues related to the transition to university mathematics? What is students understanding of proof and of its role in university mathematics?",

In FPM we studied limits of sequences and limits of functions on the real line.  We also learned about continuous functions and some of their properties such as the intermediate value property and having a maximum and a minimum on closed and bounded intervals. In Honours Analysis we extended the theory of limits to sequences of real functions and studied uniform convergence. In this course we extend these notions to the more general setting of metric spaces, i.e., sets equipped with a distance (metric).Many important spaces in Analysis have metrics. For example, the space of square integrable functions which is used in the study of Fourier series is equipped with the LÂ² metric,and the Sobolev spaces that are used in PDEs are equipped with metrics that measure the size of derivatives. A very important class of metric spaces, namely Hilbert and Banach spaces, will be studied in Linear Analysis.",

This course will introduce students to these practical issues, and will present, analyse, and apply algorithms for these tasks which are reliable and computationally efficient.

    "course_description": "The discovery of the quantum theory of nature is arguably the most far-reaching scientific revolution of the twentieth century. In the first quarter of that century it became apparent that everyday assumptions about the nature of the world begin to break down when objects the size of atoms are involved.It is the mathematics of the quantum world which is the main subject of this course. The basic ideas are now readily accessible at the undergraduate level and provide a marvellous illustration of the importance of linear spaces, linear operators, eigenvalues and differential equations in a central context in modern mathematics. (It is not intended to go into technical detail about infinite-dimensional spaces etc). This course does, however, motivate the need for a precise theory of self-adjoint operators in infinite-dimensional spaces.Apart from its intrinsic interest, a further justification for this course is that quantum ideas are now becoming important in many areas of pure mathematics: quantum groups (algebra), quantum cohomology (topology/geometry), quantum cryptography, quantum information.The course will include (some of) the following topics:- Basic postulates of quantum theory, wave function, probabilistic interpretation, Dirac notation- SchrÃ¶dinger equation and examples: potentials, bound states, tunnelling.- Operators, Heisenberg uncertainty principle, correspondence principle. Harmonic oscillator, wave packets, dispersion.- Symmetries in quantum theory: hydrogenic atoms and  their spectrum- Scattering, WKB approximation",

The course will make substantial use of elementary group theory. There are links to Year 3 Geometry and Year 4 Topology (but knowledge from those courses is not assumed).

    "course_description": "The orbifold notation for symmetry.2. Fundamental theorems of symmetry in plane and spherical geometry.3. Orbifolds and Euler characteristics.4. Group-theoretic aspects of geometric symmetry.5. Hyperbolic geometry and symmetry.6. Other topics in symmetry and geometry as decided by the class.From the earliest times and across cultures, people have been fascinated by patterns: objects or drawings that possess symmetry. As well as their aesthetic appeal, patterns are important in the material world because, for example, substances that crystallise are forming repeating patterns. Understanding the possible repeating patterns in the plane and in space is therefore a necessary part of understanding the structure of materials.In mathematics, the symmetries of an object form a group, and this course is to some extent an extended exercise in applied, practical group theory. In this course we will study the symmetry groups of two and three dimensional Euclidean space and the subgroups of them that are symmetries of repeating patterns in the plane ('wallpaper patterns'), on the sphere and on friezes (infinite strips). We will see that five-fold symmetry is impossible in wallpaper patterns and that there are in fact precisely 17 different possible symmetry groups. These patterns can be found in art and decoration throughout the ages. We will study also symmetric colourings of patterns and how this relates to group homomorphisms.Our study of this will be based on a notation popularised by John Conway in around 1990, which relates the characteristic features of the pattern to its 'orbifold' which is something like a surface but may have certain sorts of 'bad points' such as the 'conical singularity' at the base of an ice cream cone. We will need to understand about the geometry and topology of orbifolds and their 'Euler characteristics'.We will use the same methods also to understand the geometry behind some of the remarkable patterns produced by the artist Escher, which are based on repeating patterns in hyperbolic space. For this, we will need to study the geometry of hyperbolic space, which is also important in the history of mathematics for being an early example of 'non-euclidean geometry'.Â¿Hands-onÂ¿ involvement week by week and group working will be expected.",

It is a classical subject with a modern face that studies geometric spaces defined by polynomial equations in several variables.Besides providing crucial techniques and examples to many other areas of geometry and topology, recent decades have seen remarkable applications to representation theory, physics and to the construction of algebraic codes.The goal of the course is to give a basic flavour of the subject as motivation for further study through the introduction of minimal background material supplemented by a vast collection of examples. This course will introduce the basic objects in algebraic geometry: affine and projective varieties, and the maps between them. The focus will be on explicit concrete examples.We plan to cover Sections 1-5 and 7 from Reid's book (see Reading List below), which include :- basics of commutative algebra,- Hilbert Basis Theorem and the Nullstellensatz,- affine and projective varieties,- morphisms and rational maps between varieties,- conics, plane curves, quadric surfaces.",

Substantial use will be made of the theory of ordinary differential equations; the course hence builds on Honours Differential Equations (MATH10066).A suggested syllabus for the course is as follows. Diffeomorphisms and flows. Hyperbolicity and structural stability. Invariant manifolds. Bifurcations and normal forms. Asymptotic theory. Singular perturbations and multiple-scale dynamics. Attractors. Chaos and fractals.  Applications from the life sciences.",
    "course_description": "Dynamical systems theory has a rich and varied history. Established with the invention of differential calculus in the 1600s by Newton and Leibniz, dynamics was at first primarily concerned with the exact solution of differential equations. It was not until the 1800s that PoincarÃ©'s work triggered a paradigm shift towards a more qualitative point of view: instead of exact formulae, he emphasised a geometric approach, enquiring for instance about the long-term behaviour of solutions or their dependence on parameters. PoincarÃ© also theorised the possibility of chaos, which is characterised by the sensitive dependence of solutions on their initial conditions, thus making forecasts unreliable.The theory of dynamical systems has since matured, through its centuries-long history, and has found innumerable applications, not least in the life sciences; the resulting branch of mathematics is often broadly referred to as mathematical biology, and will be the focus of this course. The applications covered may include Michaelis-Menten-type enzyme kine+cs, growth and control of brain tumours, travelling fronts in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, the dynamics of infectious diseases, waves of pursuit and evasion in predator-prey systems, oscillations in population-based models, and the FitzHugh-Nagumo model for neuronal impulses.",

Starting from the ground up, we will be building a collection of well-written scripts and functions to perform increasingly sophisticated analyses, with an eye on reproducible research, self-documenting code, correctness of procedure, interpretability of results, and presentation of outcomes of the analysis.",
    "course_description": "The biomedical setting is rich in opportunities to apply mathematical approaches of different types to the analysis of patient data. These range from routine data collected from national registries, to collections of high-dimensional biomarkers measured via high-throughput techniques, to genetic and sequence data.Most often the data measured is noisy and fragmented. Moreover, it is more and more likely that the number of observations available is far exceeded by the number of variables and features available. These are important challenges when trying to use data-driven approaches in understanding the data and building predictive models.The de-facto standard programming language adopted in analysing biomedical data is the free statistical language R. This provides a flexible way to perform all types of analyses, from the simplest to the most complex, thanks to an extensive collection of packages.",

    "course_description": "Category theory begins with the observation that the collection of all mathematical structures of a given type, together with all the maps between them, is itself a nontrivial structure which can be studied in its own right. Since the birth of category theory in the 1940s, this mild observation has had great success in unifying and systematizing broad swathes of mathematics. It has now become an indispensable tool in algebra, topology and geometry, and its applications even reach into parts of computer science, physics and other branches of science.Category theory provides a bird's eye view of mathematics, revealing patterns that are invisible from ground level. But it is not all about big concepts: as for any other subject, learning category theory involves acquiring some technical skills. Central to this course is the notion of universal property, made precise through the related concepts of adjoint functors, limits and representability. Students taking this course will learn both the relevance of category theory to other parts of mathematics and a rigorous body of definitions, theorems and proofs.Syllabus:1. Categories, functors and natural transformations2. Adjoints3. Representables4. Limits5. Adjoints, representables and limits6. (Optional) Further topics in category theory (e.g. abelian categories, toposes, monads, enriched categories, monoidal categories)",

The course will also contain an introduction into the subject of special relativity.",
    "course_description": "Gauge theories are the cornerstone of many modern theories of physics such as general relativity, Yang-Mills theory, Chern-Simons theories, string theory, etc. These are examples of field theories that have rather special properties. In this course we will study examples of gauge theories from a Lagrangian and a Hamiltonian perspective. We will study Noether's theorem and the associated continuous symmetries, the role of gauge generators in the Hamiltonian formalism, the notion of large gauge transformations and charges associated with the latter. These concepts will be illustrated by studying examples of field theories such as Maxwell's theory, Chern-Simons theories and the description of free closed bosonic strings.The course will include the following topics:-Lagrangians for scalar and gauge fields- Noether's theorem and continuous symmetries- Hamiltonian description of field theories: first and second class constrained systems.- Poisson and Dirac brackets.- Charges and large gauge transformations.- Maxwell's theory.- Chern-Simons theories.- Hamiltonian description of free particles and free closed bosonic strings.",

    "summary": "This course investigates the theory of complex variables beyond our third year Honours Complex Variables course. In this course we will develop a modern approach to complex analysis, taking a Â¿several complex variablesÂ¿ perspective in the treatment of classical results such as Runge's approximation and Weierstrass' factorisation theorems. It will also naturally lead us to the sophisticated and important monodromy theorem.",
    "course_description": "Complex variables is one of the most elegant, beautiful and powerful theories we encounter in our undergraduate curriculum. We already got a nice taste of this topic in Honours Complex Variables which revealed surprising properties of complex differentiable functions; for example, once differentiable implies infinitely differentiable and more! This in turn cracked open the door and led us to CauchyÂ¿s miraculous theorem, allowing us to evaluate complex integrals over any closed curve.In this course we will throw the door wide open and unmask the many sparkling gems which underpin the subject. We will investigate the theory of functions which are complex differentiable everywhere (we call such functions entire) and we will find that entire functions behave very much like complex polynomials. We got a glimpse of this from Honours Complex Variables where we saw that every entire function can be represented by its Taylor series expansion on the whole complex plane (one of the sparkling gems in that course). So we can think of entire functions as infinite polynomials. But the analogy with polynomials is far-reaching. Complex polynomials are determined by their zeros. This is the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. Every complex polynomial can be represented uniquely as a product of linear factors determined by its zeros. We will see that an analgous statement holds for general entire functions. This is the Weierstrass Factorisation Theorem.This factorisation theorem will lead us to a deep connection between the asymptotic number of zeros of an entire function with its growth rate at infinity. As an incredible consequence, we will prove that the famous Riemann zeta function has infinitely many zeros in the critical strip. This is a significant step towards the Riemann Hypothesis, arguably the most important unsolved problem in mathematics.The Weierstrass factorisation theorem will follow from Runge's theorem which is a powerful result articulating when we can uniformly approximate complex differentiable functions on a compact set by complex differentiable functions on a given open set containing it. Runge's theorem can also be used to prove the important Mittag-Leffler theorem as well as giving us homological and cohomological forms of Cauchy's theorem. We will give a modern proof of Runge's theorem which is based on solving the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equation on a general open set. Recall that the homogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equation characterise when a function is holomorphic/complex differentiable.Honours Complex Variables is an essential pre-requisite for Further Complex Variables.  Facility with the general ideas in Honours Analysis and Metric Spaces are important, however the relevant results from these courses will be reviewed and discussed in lecture.",

This course is a modern introduction to this cornerstone of mathematical physics, formulated in the language of differential geometry.There are two lectures a week and a workshop every two weeks. There are two assignments and a closed-book exam.",
    "course_description": "This course assumes familiarity with the language of differentiable manifolds, but develops the theory of affine connections and enough pseudo-riemannian geometry (metric tensor, curvature) in order to describe the theory of General Relativity.  This is done via the postulates of General Relativity and the Einstein field equations. The course then explores solutions of the Einstein field equations,including the famous Schwarzschild black hole and the cosmological solutions, which introduces the geometric notions of homogeneity andisotropy.Syllabus:- Affine connections: covariant derivative, torsion, curvature, parallel transport, geodesics, geodesic deviation.- Riemannian geometry: metric tensors, Lorentzian metrics, Levi-Civita  connection, curvature tensors, moving frames, Cartan structure  equations, isometries, Killing vector fields.- General Relativity: special relativity and Minkowski spacetime,  Maxwell's equations, postulates of General Relativity, spacetime,  general covariance, energy-momentum tensor, Einstein equations.- Causal structure and Penrose diagram for Minkowski spacetime.- Schwarzschild solution: static and spherically symmetric spacetimes,  black hole, Kruskal extension, causal structure and Penrose  diagram.- Cosmological models: homogeneity and isotropy, the  FriedmannÂ¿LemaÃ®treÂ¿RobertsonÂ¿Walker metric.Pre-requisites--------------Students MUST have passed: Differentiable Geometry (MATH11235) .

    "course_description": "Classical incidence geometry is a branch of combinatorics which studies intersection patterns between finite families of points, lines, circles and other simple shapes. For instance, given a set of lines L and points P in the plane, we wish to count the maximum number of times a point from P lies in a line from L.This question turns out to be surprisingly deep, and relies on analytic properties of the plane. It was answered by Szemeredi--Trotter theorem, proved in 1983, which can be thought of as a `fundamental theorem of incidence geometry'.In the last 10-15 years there has been a revolution in the field of incidence geometry brought about by the introduction of the polynomial method. This has led to new and simpler proofs of the central results in the area (such as the Szemeredi--Trotter theorem) and spectacular breakthroughs on a number of long-standing conjectures. One remarkable feature of the polynomial method is that in many cases it provides very short proofs involving only elementary tools from linear algebra and polynomial arithmetic.In this course we will study some core topics in incidence geometry from the perspective of the polynomial method and, in particular, polynomial partitioning. The first goal will to be to understand the Szemeredi--Trotter theorem. We then look at other applications of polynomial partitioning, such as counting circle tangencies, the famous Erdos unit distance problem and a generalisation of the Szemeredi--Trotter theorem due to Solymosi--Tao. We then move on to some more recent developments such as the finite field Kakeya theorem and the joints theorem, both of which have strikingly simple proofs. If time permits, in the last part of the course we will study the Kakeya problem in the Euclidean plane.",

However, the space search can be very large (combinatorial explosion) and, as a consequence, exhaustive search is usually prohibitive. Therefore, specialized mathematical techniques must be used to explore the solution space in an efficient way. In order to study these techniques, it is important to understand fundamental notions from integer programming and graphs theory (total unimodularity, matching, spanning tree, etc.) as well as general techniques (lagrangean relaxation, branch-and-cut, metaheuristics).This course will study exact and heuristic methods for solving several of the most important integer and combinatorial optimization problems. We will first cover some basic notions in integer programming and graph theory. Later, they will be applied to the study of specific problems and solution algorithms.1. Integer Programming.

    "summary": "The detailed modelling of real life problems requires a knowledgeable choice of the objective function and constraints, and often leads to very large optimization problems. The efficient solution of such problems is a key to the success of optimization in practice.Data Science provides numerous instances of problems which can be modelled using optimization. The amount of data in some of these models challenges existing optimization techniques and requires the development of new ones.This course will address the methods for constrained optimization and the assumption will be made that the knowledge of an exact (or an approximation of) the second order information (Hessian of the Lagrangian) is available. The course will cover interior point methods (IPMs) for various classes of optimization problems, addressing their theory and implementation.It will also cover the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and touch on stochastic gradient (SD) used in deep learning.The successful applications of these techniques in various Data Science problems from areas such as statistics, machine learning, engineering, energy and finance, will be discussed.The practical component of this course will consist of computing laboratory work using Matlab. These exercises will reinforce the theoretical analysis of problems, methods and their implementation.",

It is extremely rare that one can obtain exact solutions to the differential equations that may occur in, for example, fluid dynamics, mathematical biology or magnetohydrodynamics. Additionally, the problems may involve the evaluation of integrals which arise, for example, through contour integration or Fourier or Laplace transform methods for solving ODEs. Thus, in many cases we are forced to employ some kind of approximation in order to make progress with our problem. Hence, we must obtain an approximate solution rather than the exact solution.In essence there are two main types of approximation: analytical approximations and numerical approximations. This module deals with the second type; the Asymptotic and Analytical Methods module deals with the first.",

    "course_description": "The solution of optimal decision-making and engineering design problems in which the objective and/or constraints are nonlinear functions of potentially (very) many variables is required on an everyday basis in the commercial and academic worlds. While often an (easy to solve) linear approximation of the problem suffices, there are many real world applications where the governing equations are truely nonlinear.A closely-related subject is the solution of nonlinear systems of equations, also referred to as least\u0002squares or data fitting problems that occur in almost every instance where observations or measurements are available for modelling a continuous process or phenomenon, such as in weather forecasting.This course will analyse the solution of nonlinear optimization problems both from a theoretical and practical point of view. The theoretical part will as much as possible try to steer away from Â¿dryÂ¿ proofs,but rather attempt to impart (often geometrical) insight into important concepts. The practical part will give a comprehensive overview of classical and modern algorithms for nonlinear optimization.The course is teamed up with computing labs which form an integral part of the course and allow students to gain first hand experience of the behaviour (advantages and inherent difficulties) of many of the studied algorithms.",

It is anticipated that it would then be delivered every other session thereafter.This course is an introduction to analytical treatment of dispersive partial differential equations. In particular, the course focuses on the theoretical study of the nonlinear SchrÃ¶dinger equations (NLS). The students will first learn Fourier transform, relevant function spaces and useful inequalities, and then use them to prove existence of unique solutions to NLS and further study their long time behaviour. The course aims to provide a glimpse of analysis in the theory of PDEs.",

    "summary": "Optimization under uncertainty aims to find optimal decisions in problems which involve uncertain data. There are various frameworks for optimization under uncertainty such as stochastic programming, robust optimization, distributionally robust optimization, chance-constrained programming, and Markov decision processes, along with their data-driven variants. These fields develop rapidly with contributions from many disciplines including operations research, mathematics, probability, statistics and computer science, and have applications in a wide variety of domains such as energy, logistics, transportation, scheduling, healthcare, and finance. This course will make a broad overview of these main themes and delve into selected methodologies. Since the incorporation of uncertainty yields computationally challenging models, there will be a particular emphasis in the course on practical implementation and tools for solving such models efficiently.",
    "course_description": "Optimization under uncertainty frameworks deal with classes of models and algorithms in which data is affected by uncertainty, i.e., some of the input data are not perfectly known at the time the decisions are made, a crucial aspect of real-world applications. The course will provide a general overview of a range of such frameworks and delve into the fundamental concepts and advanced methodologies of selected ones, including but not limited to stochastic programming and Markov decision processes. Key topics will include ways to model uncertainty (e.g., in the form of a probability distribution or uncertainty set) and incorporate it into decision-making (such as building two-stage stochastic programs for strategic problems and Markov decision process models for operational problems), and efficient solution methods for the presented model classes (such as decomposition algorithms and value function approximations). The course will also highlight more recent advances, e.g., data-driven model variants and algorithmic enhancements via the integration of machine learning. Applications 4 from various domains will be used as examples throughout the course. The course will provide a solid foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of optimization under uncertainty. Complementing the lectures, interactive workshops will deepen understanding by applying concepts to practical scenarios, reinforcing the link between theory and real-world applications. This will also help prepare students to competently apply optimization under uncertainty strategies in their future careers. The course's flexible design ensures it remains relevant amidst the evolving landscape of optimization and uncertainty,",

    "summary": "Although risk and uncertainty affect our everyday life, both are very vague concepts. As a result, there does not exist a concise definition for them that holds in general. Different public and industrial sectors will assess and manage risk in very different ways, depending on whether past observations are available, how severe outcomes can be, whether it affects only few or many, etc. Therefore, after a general introduction, specific examples from various sectors are discussed to illustrate how differing the approaches to assess and manage risk can be in practice.Starting in the 1950s, optimization and OR techniques have been developed and used to optimize logistics activities, with an ever increasing importance, role and proliferation since then. For example, in 2012 the total expenditure for logistics activities in Europe was 1,726 billion Euros. Thus, even small improvements may result in considerable monetary gains. Uncertainty and risk are inherent in logistics: Customer demand can never be forecasted exactly, travel times will never be certain, and machines or vehicles may break down, severely affecting and impairing logistics operations.",
    "course_description": "The core of risk analysis deals with questions like: What is risk? How to measure it? And what to do about it? The answers to those questions will vary from sector to sector. The course will start with introducing basic concepts of risk analysis, focusing especially on decision trees, expected utility theory and decision making under complete uncertainty. Afterwards, examples from different application areas will be discussed and it will be show how to apply these (and other) concepts to tackle the corresponding problems.Logistics focuses on moving objects, e.g. goods, in space and time such that the right object is in the right quantity at the right time at the right place. Classical logistics activities are the transportation and distribution of raw materials, subassemblies, and finished products between suppliers, factories, warehouses, and retailers, and their storage, handling, processing, and packaging. Typical goals are to maximize customer satisfaction (expressed through service levels, product quality, responsiveness, etc.) and to minimize total costs, environmental impact, and tied-up equity. Logistics planners face many challenges, ranging from conflicting goals, over supply uncertainties, uncertain customer demands and the lack of information, to the inherent difficulties of having to organize logistics activities across borders and cultures in multi-national companies.This course will focus on OR techniques to optimize the structure of the logistics network and to efficiently transport, store, and distribute goods. For each of those problems, a brief introduction and a characterization of the different types of sub-problems will be given. Afterwards, mathematical models and algorithms to solve classical problems will be discussed, each accompanied by small case studies.The overall course outline is as followsPart I: Risk Analysis1. Decision Making under Uncertainty- Introduction- Expected Utility- Having (no) Clues About the Future- (Personal) Financial Risk- Optimization under UncertaintyPart II: Logistics3. Facility Location and Network Design- The Warehouse Location Problem- Stochastic Location Problems- A Strategic Network Design Model4.

This course focuses on discrete event simulation and covers random variate generation methods to generate quantities from given probabilistic distributions. The course covers the use of statistical methods to convert available data to the necessary input to simulation models and analyse the output provided by these models as well as variance reduction techniques to apply these statistical methods more efficiently. The techniques learned in this class has very wide applicability, including but not limited to manufacturing and service systems, finance and communication networks.",
    "course_description": "This course aims to provide comprehensive instruction on utilizing  discrete-event simulation as a tool for analyzing real-world systems.  We will begin by delving into the dynamic structure of discrete-event simulations, understanding their suitability for various problems. Subsequently, we will explore techniques for generating random quantities with specified distributions to accurately capture randomness within simulations. Given the reliance of discrete-event simulations on statistical techniques, we will thoroughly examine how statistical methods are employed in both input and output analysis, emphasizing their effective and efficient utilization.Additionally, we will briefly introduce other simulation techniques, such as Monte Carlo and agent-based simulation, to broadenstudents' understanding. Throughout the course, we will utilize state\u0002of-the-art simulation software like Simul8, Arena, and Simio, while also covering the coding of discrete-event simulation models in high level programming languages such as Python, C++, and R.The course outline includes the following topics:- Discrete-Event Simulation- Random Number Generation- Uniform Random Variate Generation- Non-Uniform Random Number Generation (Inversion Method, Acceptance-Rejection Method, Composition and Convolution Methods, Special Cases)- Input Analysis- Output Analysis- Terminating Simulations- Comparing Different Systems- Steady-State Simulations- Variance Reduction- Common Random Variates- Antithetic Variates- Control VariatesUpon covering these concepts and methods, students will engage extensively in applying them to case studies, serving as the primary assessment for the course.",

    "summary": "You might hear the statement: My headache went away because I took an aspirin. But was it really the aspirin? In everyday life, causal language is often used in an informal way. However, extracting precise answers to causal questions from data requires careful consideration. First, one should assess if the data, whether observational or generated by a designed randomised experiment, is rich enough to answer the causal question. Second, one should develop and use statistical techniques with mathematical guarantees to accurately estimate the quantity of interest.In the first part of the course, we consider causal questions based on various data structures: From completely randomised experimental designs to various types of observational studies. We look at the role randomisation, design and confounding play in our ability to address these questions. For example, how should one design a population cohort, such as the Universitys Generation Scotland, to deal with confounding, maximise efficiency, and minimise bias in addressing national health policy? Causal questions, such as Did the aspirin cure my headache?, can be expressed using Neyman-Rubins theory of potential outcomes. Throughout, the material is illustrated by examples and case studies from fields such as biomedicine and healthcare policy, economics, and climate science.In the second part of the course, we turn to a general estimation strategy to answer (causal) questions from observational data. In real-world applications, learning the datas ground truth distribution is often challenging or near impossible. At the same time, seemingly helpful simplifications may render estimates biased and statistical inference invalid. Rather than relying on parametric assumptions, we introduce a model-independent approach to estimation called Targeted Learning (TL). TL integrates causal inference with machine learning, leading to valid statistical inference of (causal) quantities of interest, such as the average causal effect. The relevant statistical theory will be developed, and the methods will be applied to relevant examples and case studies using the available TL packages (tlverse) in R",
    "course_description": "In this course, we study causal inference from designed experiments and observationaldata via targeted estimation. Topics may include:- Designed experiments vs observational data, role of confounding- Basics of causal inference, e.g., potential outcomes, matching- Case study: Design of population cohorts- Model-independent definition of a statistical parameter,- Ensemble learning and cross-validation,- Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation for statistical inference",

The end result will be a joint report submitted by the end of the semester, together with a brief presentation and production of a poster. The topic of the taster project should be from a different aspect of analysis and its applications from your initial ideas about PhD research topic, and is intended to broaden your outlook into less familiar areas. For example, if you've got your heart set on a main project within pure mathematics then you could do a taster project on applied probability or numerical methods, or a mixture of the two.",

    "summary": "This is a project undertaken in groups, in a flexible format, following one of several models. Industry-stream students will take an industrial taster project as described below.In the industrial taster project model, groups will work on aspects of a real problem from industry. Problems will be described at the Industrial Sandpit in Semester 1. The project work not only provides insights into real-world challenges for mathematics and how mathematical scientists work with industry, but also provides general research skills training to give you experience in a broad range of activities that will be useful during and after your PhD, irrespective of your topic and later employment. Each group will have an academic supervisor and a contact from industry. Ideally each group will have a mixed skill set so that some members can work on background theory, others on modelling, and some on efficient implementation. The output is a joint presentation and a written report submitted at the end of the semester.A second model has a similar structure to MIGS: Project 1 but is undertaken in a different area.A third model introduces the group to a set of widely-used techniques in a given broad area. Overseen by one or more academic supervisors, you will give individual seminar-style presentations (covering the basic notions of each technique, together with some applications that you have researched yourselves) to the rest of the group. Collectively the group will write up its findings into a dossier which will count towards the assessment.",
