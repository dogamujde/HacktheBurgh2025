    "summary": "An CÃ¹rsa Comais is an intensive language learning course designed for intermediate level learners whose aim is fluency in the language. The major focus is on language skills, both speaking and writing, but other subjects will be introduced as the course progresses. Students on An CÃ¹rsa Comais undertake a three week work placement within a Gaelic medium school as part of the Greis-gnÃ¬omhachais module.",
    "course_description": "There is an emphasis in An CÃ¹rsa Comais on developing fluency in Gaelic.  An CÃ¹rsa Comais develops students' language abilities and confidence in using the language through intensive language teaching approaches and by employing communicative immersion techniques.  In this respect, during class contact time - particularly in lecture, tutorial and seminar group situations - students are encouraged to take an active part in discussions. Structure sessions introduce practice, and revise and drill grammar, syntax and pronunciation. These sessions are designated as times for the remediation of errors. In both courses a considerable amount of time is spent on developing oral and written skills in Gaelic and the Greis-gnÃ¬omhachais module provides students with the opportunity to use Gaelic confidently and effectively in a work environment.The SMO strategy, with regard to An CÃ¹rsa Comais, will be to deliver the three main language modules as an integrated block (the other three being taught as discrete modules in the usual way). Delivery is via face to face tuition and there is contact time of 20-plus hours a week in Semester One and a little less in Semester Two when classes begin in the subject module, and when the language placement module takes students away from the college campus for three weeks. The course offers a challenging and intensive language learning environment with communicative methodologies and primary focus on oral work in the target language. The underlying philosophy for the student is to carry his/her language development forward through speech and performance, both in the spontaneous and incidental whole-class discussions which are a typical feature of day to day classroom life, and in the structured communication exercises which form the practical basis of each lesson.",

This course is taught in parallel with the first-year professional practice placement and students will have the opportunity to try out the research techniques they are being taught while on placement.  The course design is cyclical with a theoretical input delivered in the form of an online lecture, followed by a training in-put around a particular phase of the research process.  Students are then invited to try-out the technique on placement and then return with their results to a workshop session the following week.  This pattern lends an applied experience that the students can relate clearly to the practice setting.  Students knowledge, understanding and skills are evidenced throughout the process through the feed-back workshops.  The students complete their learning through the presentation of a research proposal for a piece of small-scale research that they intend to carry-out during the placement.",

    "summary": "An understanding of the dynamic relationship between ideology and social problems is central to a critical analysis of educational and professional engagement in communities. That is to say, social and educational policies have to be understood as ideologically informed ways of seeing the world rather than as neutral and disinterested constructions of social problems. Moreover, professionalism is marked by some degree of autonomy and capacity to interpret and define - and if necessary, redefine - social problems and their solutions in ways which benefit individuals and groups in communities. In general terms policy always needs to be interpreted and ideological understanding is a resource for this. This foundational course for community educators is intended to develop students' ideological awareness, analytical skills and intellectual capacity to make cogent political arguments in relation to the analysis of social problem definition, solution and action. The teaching programme presents a wide range of ideological perspectives through which to examine the wider political and policy context in which educational work is undertaken. Many of the concerns addressed in the course are applicable to other professions which engage with communities",
    "course_description": "1. Academic description as summary above2. Outline contentWeek 1 is a broad introduction to the course. In the following 4 weeks we examine some establishedideological perspectives which are important for understanding the ideas, values and assumptions informing policy problems and solutions and, thereafter alternative ideological perspectives which help us think critically about the established ones. These perspectives are not exhaustive but provide an opportunity to examine major influences on policy as well as important critiques. After these we will look at selected policy areas through the lens of ideological framing.3. Student learning experienceGood teaching and learning involves a joint effort and constructive dialogue. Our experience in running this course over a number of years confirms this claim. We hope it will be a challenging and informative experience which you engage with in a committed and thoughtful way: teaching staff are passionate about their subject and seek to instil the same passion in you.The taught programme involves two weekly lecture sessions plus a seminar which involves, in total, 3 x 5O minute contact periods per week. The lectures will introduce key ideological perspectives, policy areas and their critical appraisal and will involve a lively input on selective aspects of the ideology or policy area with opportunities for questions and discussion.Seminars will be student-led featuring poster presentations leading into more general discussion facilitated by a written feedback on poster presentations.To maximise your learning experience it is essential that you undertake some preparation. Each week this will involve guided reading from a course text book and, for the seminars, identifying a policy issue, something current in the news, which can be the focus for developing skills in ideological analysis and critique. Teaching staff will provide guidance on this activity.",

The central aim is to develop the students' understanding of and ability to utilise different theories of childhood to understand their own and other people's everyday values, taken for granted assumptions, patterns of behaviour and work practices. Students will be asked to identify how topical aspects of childhood relate to different representations of childhood within childhood studies literature.Particular emphasis is placed on sociological and psychological understandings of social action, socialisation and development. This theoretical perspective will underpin later courses that explore childhood and the family, children's rights and  work-based modules exploring personal, professional and organisational development.",

In general terms policy always needs to be interpreted and this creates scope for professional agency to be enacted. This foundational course is intended to develop studentsÂ¿ ideological awareness, analytical skills and critical capacity to make cogent political arguments in their work in order to assist the analysis of social problem definition. The teaching programme will present a range of theoretical and ideological perspectives as frameworks through which to examine the wider political and policy context in which educational work is undertaken.

The course design is cyclical with a theoretical input delivered in the form of an online lecture, followed by a training in-put around a particular phase of the research process.  Students are then invited to try-out the technique on placement and then return with their results to a workshop session the following week.  This pattern lends an applied experience that the students can relate clearly to the practice setting.

Through the taught sessions we will examine distinctive features of each domain in terms of relevant historical developments, the broader social context and their significance on shaping the purpose of contemporary practice.",
    "course_description": "Academic Summary1. This course will examine the 3 domains of practice that constitute the contemporary CLD sector; namely community development, adult education and youth work. The taught programme will explore pedagogical themes, examine the contemporary policy context, and consider the implications for professional practice in each of the domains.2. Outline ContentIt is important to understand the relationship between theoretical ideas, the policy context and CLD practice. Perspectives on the nature and purpose of CLD are informed by historical traditions as well as social, economic and political changes in society over time. The course will introduce and explore the historical traditions, principles and values that have shaped the domains of practice. The priorities for CLD practice are frequently the subject of debate. For example, the goals of policy can often undermine or compromise the needs of learners in our communities. The taught sessions will focus on a range of issues, challenges and opportunities faced by the modern-day CLD practitioner. Across the 3 domains, we will identify and study common themes as well as discrete aspects of contemporary practice in youth work, adult education and community development respectively.3. Student learning experienceThis course will be taught through a weekly 3 hour session, consisting of two 85 minute lecture/seminars separated by a 10 minute break. The first session in week 1 will be an introduction to the whole course. Each domain of practice will then be covered in six 85 minute sessions, taught in a consecutive block. For example, six sessions focused on Adult Education, followed by six on youth work and then six on Community Development. The last 3 sessions will be focused on preparation for and engagement in a practitioner panel discussion facilitated by students and finally a course review. The lecture/seminars will include tutor led input of knowledge and students will be encouraged to engage with this knowledge, discussing their views in small groups and with the whole class.",

In addition, a core part of the course which is embedded in all teaching and learning activities is a focus on academic literacies, which is supported by an introductory unit on learning at university.Four half-days will be spent in schools during the second part of the semester, providing students with the opportunity to observe and familiarise themselves with schools as educational institutions 'from the other side of the teacher's desk': this opportunity will allow students to contextualise course content in the professional setting of the school.",
    "course_description": "The course is divided in two blocks.In Block 1: Policy and Practice for Inclusion, Weeks 1 to 5 are focused on different areas of inclusion and the diversity of learners teachers meet in the course of their work. Students are asked to consider teachers' importance as a role model for learners, an agent of transformation and change, and the pivotal point through which educational policy can be enacted in educational settings. As the weeks move on, they will look at Additional Support Needs, race and multiculturalism, and physical impairments of various kinds to see how they can ensure their teaching practices meet different learners' needs in the light of inclusion and social justice.In Block 2: Schools of the Future, Weeks 5 to 11 build on the gained knowledge and understanding to consider the purposes and role of schooling, the development of future inclusive schools in the context of globalisation, sustainability and social justice and the role of future teachers, in shaping education and prepare critical learners. A key part of the course is to critically consider the contribution of research to educational policy development as well as the influence of practice on shaping the research and educational policy agenda through, for example, critical discourse analysis.During the course, students will engage with school-related learning tasks to consider the role of different agencies aimed at supporting pupils and families and enhancing the educational experiences of learners in different environment. Students will develop their skills in document analysis as a qualitative research method by examining legislation and policy that promotes inclusion, equality and children's rights and considers multi-agency approaches and partnerships in supporting pupils learning in different environments.",

The course draws predominantly on the disciplines of developmental psychology and psychomotor development, along with introductory material on neuroscience in education, placing these in an educational context.The course includes observations tasks to enable students to contextualise and reflect on their learning, as well as to carry out research tasks.",
    "course_description": "Academic description/outline content:The course consists of two strands which run concurrently, to support students in understanding the links between developmental research/theory and research methods.1. Understanding Development in Childhood and AdolescenceThis begins with an overview of how childhood and adolescence are conceptualised within a wide range of disciplines, including developmental psychology and the sociology of childhood. It then goes on to focus on developmental psychology and psychomotor development. Students are encouraged to critically consider the ecological context of development in childhood and adolescence, from micro to macro level influences, a theme that is revisited through the course. The bulk of this strand consists of a critical examination of theories and research on typical and atypical cognitive, social, emotional and psycho-motor development in childhood and adolescence. Students are encouraged to view development holistically, and to consider the connections between different aspects of development. The research covered includes classic studies as well as more recent research that builds on this earlier work. There is also an introduction to the discipline of neuroscience in education, with discussion of the development of the brain, and the relationship between brain development and learning. This includes some coverage of neuromyths in Education (linking to the idea of the teacher as a reflective/critical practitioner). Throughout the course students are asked to consider the bidirectional links between development and education. They are encouraged to critically reflect on the extent to which knowledge of development can enhance educators' practice in engaging children/adolescents in learning and supporting social development. In particular, links between child/adolescent development and 'Health and Well-being' within the Curriculum for Excellence will be highlighted, as will the relationship between development and behaviour.2. Researching Development in Childhood and AdolescenceIn this strand, students are initially introduced to the broad range of qualitative and quantitative research methods used within developmental psychology. There is then an introduction to experimental and quasi-experimental research design, with students encouraged to consider and critique the experimental methods discussed within the first strand of the course. From within the broad range of research methods, students then be introduced to quantitative observational approaches in more detail. They will be supported to use this method to conduct a piece of small-scale research into one aspect of development (this research may take place within an educational context or using existing data sets). Students are then supported to develop their understanding of and ability to work with quantitative data, using descriptive statistics to describe elementary data, including their own observational data. A key component throughout this strand is the ethics around research involving children and adolescents, including issues of informed consent and power dynamics in research. Throughout this strand students are also encouraged to reflect on the relationship between developmental research and educational practice.Student learning experience:Weekly lectures and workshops. During the course students will be asked to engage with a variety of learning experiences, including: lecture content, discussion of video clips, small and whole group workshop discussions, small group tasks, and computer-based learning (e.g. literature searching, quantitative data analysis).Outwith classes, students will be asked to undertake and reflect on reading prior to each lecture or workshop. Additional preparation (e.g. work on small group tasks) will also be required before workshops. Work on formative and summative assessment tasks will be required outwith class.Students will be encouraged to use resources provided in class, as well as external resources (e.g. Institute for Academic Development) to develop the academic literacy and numeracy skills required for the workshops and assessments.",

The course explores historical and philosophical approaches to individual needs, building on the concepts of child development covered in Education 2a and assists in preparing students for future school placements where relevant. In this course students will deepen their understanding of inclusion and citizenship education, they will begin to look critically at policy and the politics of education, and the ways in which policies are constructed and implemented. Additionally, students will develop their knowledge and understanding towards the role of teacher as an agent for change and using their own personal experience they will share thoughts in order to build the school of the future.",
    "course_description": "The course is divided in two blocks.In Block 1: Policy and Practice for Inclusion, Weeks 1 to 5 are focused on different areas of inclusion and the diversity of learners teachers meet in the course of their work. Students are asked to consider teachers' importance as a role model for learners, an agent of transformation and change, and the pivotal point through which educational policy can be enacted in educational settings.  As the weeks move on, they will look at Additional Support Needs, race and multiculturalism, and physical impairments of various kinds to see how they can ensure their teaching practices meet different learners' needs in the light of inclusion and social justice.In Block 2: Schools of the Future, Weeks 5 to 11 build on the gained knowledge and understanding to consider the purposes and role of schooling, the development of future inclusive schools in the context of globalisation, sustainability and social justice and the role of future teachers, in shaping education and prepare critical learners. A key part of the course is to critically consider the contribution of research to educational policy development as well as the influence of practice on shaping the research and educational policy agenda through, for example, critical discourse analysis.During the course, students will spend time on placement in a range of settings to gain experience of interactions between schools and various agencies aimed at supporting pupils and families and enhancing the educational experiences of learners in different environments including different areas across Scotland. Students will develop their skills in document analysis as a qualitative research method by examining legislation and policy that promotes inclusion, equality and children's rights and considers multi-agency approaches and partnerships in supporting pupils learning in different environments.During the course, students will spend time on placement in a range of settings to gain experience of interactions between schools and various agencies aimed at supporting pupils and families and enhancing the educational experiences of learners in different environments including different areas across Scotland.

    "summary": "This course offers the student an opportunity to engage with and to develop understanding of learning and teaching mathematics in Scottish primary schools. A prime purpose of the course is to prepare and support students in becoming knowledgeable, confident and reflective practitioners in relation to their teaching of primary mathematics.  The course will build upon their knowledge of  theories of learning and apply these in the context  of  a  mathematical learning environment. It will develop 'pedagogical content knowledge' (PCK) that will support the student in developing effective practice (Shulman, 1986).   Students will explore unifying themes and theories of learning within mathematics education through studies of common conceptions, misconceptions, and difficulties that learners encounter.  These explorations will include analyses of specific teaching strategies that can be used to address learners' needs in particular classroom situations.  Students will also devote personal study time to further develop their subject matter knowledge, extending their understandings from knowing that to knowing why, as preparation for teaching key areas of the primary mathematics curriculum.",
    "course_description": "Illustrative topic content includes:- Conceptual development of number: focusing on representations and practical application of early number work through to fractions, decimals and percentages.- Methods of calculating: including mental strategies that lead to informal records and appropriate written methods based on current research.- Pedagogical knowledge in support of Shape, Position and Movement: extending experiences from early shape to capitalise on technological exploration and investigation of position, movement, angle and pattern using programmable toys and 'Turtle' graphics.- Developing mathematical thinking that can be extended to 'generalisation' and foundations of mathematical proof, incorporating algebraic thinking appropriate to age and stage of learners.- Developing learner's knowledge and confidence in the ideas of chance and uncertainty, and other features of handling data that relate to citizenship and critical mathematics education.",

    "summary": "This course forms the primary learning experience for the Network for Intercultural Competence to facilitate Entrepreneurship (NICE) project and is based upon the Student-Led Individually-Created Course (SLICC) University-wide reflective learning and assessment framework. The NICE reflective e-portfolio of learning is a self-designed experiential learning assignment, where students reflect upon their experience of working within a transnational team to resolve a global challenge.  The course will run from the middle of second semester and into summer vacation. The e-portfolio is a space for students to provide evidence of their learning. As a participating student, undertaking the NICE SLICC will enable you to create a learning experience, which is unique to you and your own academic and professional aspirations, while demonstrating your learning and academic achievement against defined learning outcomes.This level 8 course will require you to demonstrate the development of your skills and understanding in terms of critical analysis, application, reflection, recognising and developing your skills and mindsets, and evaluation within a defined context of your learning experience. This course will also enable you to demonstrate your ability to exercise autonomy and initiative when tackling a global challenge.",
    "course_description": "A Network for Intercultural Competence to facilitate Entrepreneurship (NICE) SLICC requires you to propose, develop and manage a unique learning experience that will enable you to evidence how you have achieved the learning outcomes of the course.Your NICE learning experience adheres to a defined structure that supports and enables you to self-direct and manage your own learning experience. Within this structure however, you will have the opportunity to shape your learning outcomes around your interests and goals within the specific context of NICE, your trans-national team, and selected global challenge, provided your proposal is academically feasible and is approved by your tutor.The steps in undertaking a NICE SLICC are as follows:1) Identify your team's global challenge and consider ways in which you can shape your learning experience around it.2) Write your draft proposal and submit to your tutor/advisor for approval.3) Self-direct and manage your own learning experience.4) Actively and regularly reflect upon and document your experience with evidence and use that as a basis for writing your self-critical 'Interim Reflective Report', then your 'Final Reflective Report'.5) Formatively self-assess and submit your 'Final Reflective Report' for summative assessment by your tutor.The steps identified above each require a significant amount of thought and input and will ultimately form part of a 'time-based' e-portfolio of evidence, which will be used in the assessment of your NICE SLICC.Undertaking a NICE SLICC you will not only develop the content of your learning experience but also produce an agreed portfolio of outputs where you must evidence what you have learned and, importantly, where you demonstrate how you met the learning outcomes for the course.",

Â«br /Â»'E-Portfolio of Evidence' (0%) - At the proposal approval stage for your NICE SLICC, your tutor/advisor will discuss and agree with you what outputs and information need to be created, collated and submitted in your portfolio. This e-portfolio will support and provide evidence for your learning and development of skills throughout your NICE SLICC. Your portfolio should be constructed throughout the duration of your learning experience, demonstrating evolution, iteration and progress over-time. It must include a regular reflective blog diary.  It should contain other evidence, which may take many forms including photographs, documents, reports, feedback, video, podcasts, etc. Â«br /Â»The 'E-Portfolio of Evidence' is used to support the assessments of against Learning Outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  Â«br /Â»Formative 'Self-Assessment' (0%) - An important component of your final submission, in addition to your ability to self-critically reflect on your experience, is to demonstrate your understanding of your achievements through graded self-assessment. In your 'Self-assessment' you are required to demonstrate the alignment of the grades given by you for each learning outcome to the justification for them, and where this is evidenced within your e-portfolio. Â«br /Â»Self-critical 'Final Reflective Report' (100%) - This report is the key component of your assessment.  You are expected to document and demonstrate active self-critical reflection and responses to your learning throughout your experience.  It is essential that your report is linked to and draws upon your 'E-Portfolio of Evidence' of your learning.  Maximum word limit is 3000 words.Â«br /Â»The 'Final Reflective Report' is assessed against Learning Outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5: the report's structure directs you to reflect upon your experience of the NICE SLICC as it relates to each of the five individual learning outcomes."

To develop their understanding of progression in learning within and across disciplines students will engage with lectures and workshops. Through the course students will also be introduced to approaches to  integrating the curriculum (including interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary learning) and the associated practices in learning and teaching.",
    "course_description": "The aim of the course is for students to develop knowledge and understanding of three main areas: progression in learning, 'the curriculum' and integrating the curriculum.  These aims are set against a national and international context of significant and continuous curriculum reform.  Therefore, it is important that student teachers consider what curriculum is, how it is constructed and how it supports the progression of learning.  As they explore progression in learning students will begin to critique the concept of 'the curriculum' and consider this in relation to recent curriculum developments within Scotland, Curriculum for Excellence (Scottish Executive, 2006).Building on learning from Primary Studies 1 on the nature of knowledge and curriculum students will look at progression of learning in each curricular area making use of the Curriculum for Excellence guidelines to explore this.  In addition to drawing on concepts of disciplinarity,  students will be supported to consider the concept of integrating the curriculum and what is meant by multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinarity approaches to teaching and learning in the primary context. Students will work towards an understanding of the ways in which multi, inter and trans disciplinarity can be used to support learners.The course will be taught through lectures and workshops led by curriculum specialists and primary education specialists.  Curriculum specialists will explore with students the ways in which their subjects lend themselves to interdisciplinarity in the classroom and the limitations and complexities of this. They will demonstrate the processes involved in planning, teaching assessing and evaluating stimulating, meaningful and appropriate learning within each discipline. Through the course assessments students will be able to apply their learning in a practical sense, firstly through analysis of video recordings of children's learning experiences.  Secondly, to provide students with the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills they have developed through the lectures and workshops in the second assignment they will have the opportunity to develop a curriculum plan which integrates the curriculum and considers progression in learning; students could make use of this plan on their Year 3 professional experience and practice.",

    "summary": "This course drawing on the debates in contemporary research; focuses on students developing an understanding of physical culture, so that their professional practice is informed and underpinned by philosophical and sociological perspectives. Physical culture is a term with historical origins which is now being used in contemporary analyses focused on understanding institutionalised forms of physical activity. Understanding the historical and contemporary relationship between, physical activity, physical exercise, physical recreation, leisure, dance and sport is necessary for informed professional practice in physical education and sports science. A relational analysis of institutionalised forms of physical activity enables the identification of the complex and interconnected forms of engagement that take place. A key part of the course is the critical analysis of how physical culture is evaluated, appreciated and engaged with within contemporary society.  Students through critical analysis of relevant and recent research consider how their experience of physical culture influences the formation of their identity and the implications that this may have for professional practice in physical education and sports science.",
    "course_description": "* Key philosophical perspectives and the aesthetic dimension of physical culture.* Definitional issues, distinctions and demarcations within different terms such as physical activity, physical exercise and sport.* Historical and contemporary usage of 'physical culture' including an exploration of the interrelated nature of institutionalised forms of physical activity and their roots within different cultures.* The socially and politically mediated nature of 'physical culture' by examining the commercialisation, commoditization and representation in the media.* Key literature and concepts such as 'relational analysis' to consider the different experience and experiences of individuals and groups within society in relation to the concepts of the legitimate body and the legitimate use of the body.* Student's practical participation and engagement with practical activities consider the classification of physical activities.* Review and consideration of how perceptions of physical culture influence the formation of identities.The course will be delivered as a series of blocks, which focus on specific aspects of course content. Key lecture presentations from University staff and on-online learning materials on the VLE, will provide important syntheses of core concepts central to students understanding of the courses aims and learning outcomes. Students will be required to study independently before and after key presentations and activities, so that they are able to engage in the sessions that follow. Workshops will focus on the critical evaluation and analysis of relevant research literature that forms the core of the required reading for the course. The workshops and supporting online material will aid students in developing their ability to critique academic literature and develop an enquiring analysis of the concept of physical culture. As part of practical-related learning tasks on the course, students will engage in the consideration of movement pieces that will interweave with theoretical material.",

    "course_description": "1) Academic DescriptionThe practice of informal education attempts to build a creative tension between the need to be structured in our approach to educational work and the need for spontaneity in engaging with people. This course attempts to develop the student's familiarity with this tension and to consider a range of methodological approaches which can help to introduce educational aims into informal settings.  There are four interrelated themes to this course that have to do with: Inquiry; Experience; Knowledge; Dialogue and Praxis. Each theme will be considered from a theoretical and a methodological standpoint. The first session of each thematic period will be concerned with conceptual principals while the second session will consider the more practical application of ideas.2) Indicative ContentExperienceKnowledge and KnowingDeveloping DialoguePraxis and the transition from reflection to actionDeveloping ActionPresentation workshops3) Learning Experience.The course design is cyclical, modulating between theory and practice modes in order to emphasise the relationship between the two. The students are engaged in this process by developing case study scenarios where they are encouraged to apply the core thematic ideas of the course in a practice setting of their own design. While the theory sessions are focused on reading, in-put and discussion, the practice sessions focus on methods and their application to the student's case studies.  This curriculum design is developed to demonstrate some of the core themes of the course including praxis.",

This course builds on the learning outcomes of Community-based Research 1 and 2, but is open to outside students studying at level 9.The course will consider the role of research in community practice, particularly as it relates to the co-construction of knowledge with communities.To this end, the course introduces students to the theory and practice of participatory action research (PAR). PAR is an approach combining a commitment to identify and address social injustices, with rigorous research about those injustices.Through a mixture of taught inputs and dialogues with practitioners, a range of practitioner research will be considered.  Students will learn why and how these research projects were undertaken and what the impact was on the practice setting.2) Indicative ContentThe Purposes of Practitioner ResearchParticipatory Action Research: Epistemology and MethodParticipatory Data AnalysisThe Ethics of Practitioner Research: Considering Power and PositionalityDesign your own Practitioner Research ProjectDissemination and Reporting3) Learning ExperienceThe course is a mixture of theoretical in-put in taught sessions and practical skills development both in class and in the field.  This course is taught in parallel with the third-year professional practice placement and students will have the opportunity to experiment with and apply participatory research methods on placement. The course design is cyclical with a theoretical input followed by a training in-put around a particular phase of the research process.  Students are then invited to try-out the technique on placement and then return with their results to a workshop session the following week.  This pattern lends an applied experience that the students can relate clearly to the practice setting.  Students knowledge, understanding and skills are evidenced throughout the process through the feed-back workshops.  The students complete their learning through the presentation of a research proposal for a piece of small-scale research that they intend to carry-out during the placement.N.B. Students may choose to pilot an approach they are considering using in their dissertation.",

It will enable students to analyse the relationship between theoretical traditions and the purpose of community-based CLD practice within these domains.",
    "course_description": "Academic descriptionThis course is particularly concerned with the current policy context as it constructs and constrains the professional practitioner in these three CLD domains of practice. It aims to locate and critically analyse those policy discourses which inform the context of practice to examine competing and contrasting priorities for the modern-day practitioner and to identify what spaces exist between competing discourses and demands in which to develop a critical, competent, ethical and coherent practice in; Community Work, Youth Work or Adult Education.Outline contentThis course will offer students an intensive engagement with the key domains of practice. For example the Youth Work element will include sessions on; youth work traditions and principles, contexts for practice, contemporary policy themes such as employability and participation, and the challenges faced by youth work practitioners. Students will develop an understanding of the impact of the social, economic and political factors on the lives and lifestyles of young people. The Adult Education element will draw on aspects of critical social theory to examine changing relationships between the state, economy and civil society and how these are mediated by current policy developments. Through a number of selective case studies students will consider how to work in critical and creative ways which can further social purpose adult education. The Community Work element will explore the changing context of practice and examine the role of the professional practitioner. A range of policy discourses and approaches will be explored and critically examined such as; community engagement, well being and resilience, asset based approaches, citizenship and participation and using the arts.Student learning experienceThe course is designed to be taught over 2 and a half days per week, with sessions in the morning and afternoon. Following a course introduction there will be 10, 2 hour sessions focusing on each domain of practice. Students should attend all sessions, but the minimum requirement is that they attend all of the sessions relating to 2 domains of practice.The last 3 sessions of the course will bring all students together to explore the commonalities and differences between these domains of practice and the implications these have for theory and practice. The last session will also involve  a review of the course and an assessment briefing",

    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionThis is an honours-level course intended to equip students with a relatively advanced understanding of the purpose, theory and methodology of critical policy analysis. This course consolidates and extends the critical capacities developed by students through years one to three, especially in the courses 'Ideology and social problems' and 'Domains of practice 3: critical analysis'. Specifically, this course builds on the rationale underpinning these earlier courses: namely, that the acumen to deconstruct and, if necessary, reconstruct policy discourses is an essential component of professional competence. This is the case because social justice, empowerment and participatory democracy are core professional values. Thus, the course places particular emphasis on working together to apply practical strategies for analysing and shaping policy in socially just directions.Indicative contentFirstly, students are introduced to methods and conceptual frameworks for critical policy analysis, before moving on to operationalise these methods and frameworks by interrogating the ways in which relevant policy areas constrain and open up possibilities for professional action. Students are also encouraged to think creatively about how such methods could be applied to educational interventions in community settings. We consider policy discourses in different domains (for example, wellbeing and employability) as well as at different scales (from the local to the transnational).The first half of the course focuses on the theory and methodology of critical policy analysis. We explore Carol Bacchi's 'What's the problem represented to be?' approach. We explore Critical Discourse Analysis, drawing on the work of Fairclough and Wodak. We also explore working with frames, drawing on the work of Crompton and Lakoff.In the second half of the course, we apply these methods to a range of relevant policy areas. Since policy is dynamic these policy areas are regularly revised and updated to reflect the current context. However, indicative content may include: employability, health and wellbeing, welfare, co-production, austerity, asset transfer and community ownership, housing, equality and diversity, sustainability and so on.Learning experienceSessions are two hours long. The first hour is comprised of a taught input and the second hour is comprised of a tutorial focused on applying theories and methods of critical policy analysis. Formative feedback will be offered in these tutorials, which students will be able to apply productively to the summative task. Students are also encouraged to consider critical policy analysis as a research method in its own right, and one which may be fruitfully employed in the dissertation.",

    "summary": "In this course, students will assess their development as childhood practitioners by carrying out a small-scale research project through which they will attempt to improve their own practice. A systematic process of self-development activities will support the students to progressively develop the capacity to act as 'reflective practitioners' by initiating and evaluating practice interventions. Course tutors will introduce the theory and practice of research, consultation and evaluation and support students in designing and carrying out their own research projects. Students will gain knowledge and experience of a range of different approaches to childhood research that have enabled parents and children and young people to influence children's services. Specific emphasis will be placed on the ethics of childhood research, the variety of tools employed in research and consultation with children and young people and the roles that practitioner-researchers can adopt. Students will be encouraged to compare and contrast different approaches to research and evaluation. By developing and carrying out their own research, students will develop their ability to integrate knowledges of childhood theory and to critically analyse work based practices.",
    "course_description": "This course runs over two semesters.In Semester 1, students will gain knowledge about the basics of doing social research, including sessions on:- research design- developing research questions- searching and reviewing literature- methodology- ethics- analysis- dissemination.At the end of Semester 1, students submit a research proposal (1,000 words) and fill in the form for ethics approval.Semester 2 is devoted to conducting the research, and sessions are designed to guide students in doing this step-by-step. In particular, class sessions revisit topics from Semester 1 and relate it to the students' research practice by addressing the following questions:- How do the students' chosen methods work in practice?- What ethical issues arise when carrying out the research?- How will students analyse their data?- How can students be reflexive in research?THIS COURSE IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS ON THE BA CHILDHOOD PRACTICE PROGRAMME.",

Issues such as marketing and culture, the selection of appropriate texts, gender and its effect on young readers and reluctant readers will be considered. Students will use a critical approach as they examine and evaluate the literary and linguistic techniques employed by different writers to manipulate language for different purposes and to create particular effects. This approach will provide a model for considering what constitutes meaningful language activities in response to the reading of fictional texts and will be underpinned by current thinking and research into effective learning and teaching.",

Therefore the core philosophy of the course is that students will develop the ability to reflect on themselves as readers through keeping a personal reader's log and contributing to sessions on different texts for children.Students are also taught, at their own level, how to analyse text at text in order to increase their confidence in this area of knowledge and understanding.Additionally, the course gives students the opportunity to consider certain key debates within the field of children's literature such as: Instruction or Delight, Fantasy or Realism, Popular or Prestigious, the Conception of Childhood, the Conception of the Child Reader, and the development of Socially Committed Children's Fiction.The course looks for links and themes through the developing history and traditions of children's fiction. It considers whether children's literature can be defined as having rules or conventions which make it different from adult literature. It considers what it is that makes a 'classic' text and the place of children's literature in the global market place.In terms of pedagogy the course investigates motivating and guiding children into becoming life long readers; designing teaching materials that support children in their literary exploration of text; gender differences and preferences in relation to reading and the links between reading and writing.",

Students will be encouraged to reflect on how they can use their knowledge of child development to enhance their practice in engaging children in learning and supporting children's social development. Throughout the course the emphasis will be on understanding the child within their home, social and cultural contexts. The course team and invited guest speakers bring together research expertise in cognitive and social development, atypical development, and educational psychology. Throughout the course they will draw on their own research to highlight the important connections between psychological research and educational practice.",
    "course_description": "Academic description:This course is designed to provide student with an opportunity to extend their knowledge of a range of current psychological theories and research on cognitive and social child development. These topics may include, for example: attachment theory, executive function, memory and learning, neuroscience in Education, theory of mind development, the role of physical activity in cognitive development,  friendships and play.Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to reflect on their experience working with children (e.g. in schools) and to consider how the developmental psychology research fits with their own experiences, observations and reflections. Indeed, the links between psychological research/theories of children's development and educational policy and practice will be a central theme running throughout this course. Students will be encouraged to critically evaluate psychology theory and research, and to take an evidence-based approach to understanding the two-way relationship between developmental psychology and education.Throughout the sessions there will be discussion of both classic and recent research findings, and through this students will be provided with opportunities to reflect on developmental psychology research methods and ethics. Throughout the course, students are encouraged to consider development holistically, considering the two-way relationship between the individual and their environment (e.g. family) and the role that societal and cultural factors play in children's life experiences and development.Outline content:The course will be divided into ten sessions. The first eight of these sessions focus on a different aspect of child development and the links between psychological research/theory and education. Specific topics are likely to change from year to year, but may include: attachment theory, executive function, memory and learning, neuroscience in Education, theory of mind development, the role of physical activity in cognitive development,  friendships and play. The final sessions focus on formative assessment and summative assessment preparation.Student learning experience:In the weekly classes, students will be asked to engage with a range of learning experiences, including: interactive lecture content; discussion of video clips; small and whole group discussion; small group tasks; and (where possible) input from guest speakers.Outwith classes, students will be asked to undertake and reflect on reading before each class. Reading is likely to be a mixture of quantitative and qualitative research, but students will be provided with some support in critical reading of developmental psychology research. To support them in the course assignment, they will also be encouraged to engage with resources provided in class and via other sources (e.g. the Institute for Academic Development).Students will be expected to evidence and demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes via discussion, input into group activities, and, ultimately, in the formative and summative assignments.",

Working from the key principle that talent is a broad, multidimensional concept, the course will examine how the widespread implementation of talent development principles, frameworks and practices can be employed in schools. More specifically, current approaches to talent development will be outlined and critically evaluated (e.g., psycho-behaviours, focussing specifically on MacNamara's (2011) Psychological Characteristics of Developing Excellence (PCDEs) framework). Furthermore, the wider educational benefits of developing psycho-behaviours in school settings will be explored, namely their transferability and potential to enhance learning, attainment and achievement in other facets of young peoples' lives - and in other subject areas in the curriculum, as well as the long-term positive impact on pupil health and wellbeing.",

Contemporary views, issues and debates e.g. talent development v talent identification in physical education and youth sport settings.- Schools as talent development environments - Examining stage models, pathways, talent development frameworks and curriculums and their efficacy in school settings.- Developing expertise - applying the principles of deliberate preparation, deliberate play, and deliberate practice.- The role of psycho behaviours in talent development - Examining the wider role and application of Psychological Characteristics of Developing Excellence (PCDEs) (MacNamara, 2011) across physical education and youth sport settings.The course will be taught through weekly lectures, seminars and practical workshops. The course content will be delivered in a variety of ways i.e. whole group lectures, small seminar group discussions and student led tasks. In addition to the taught lecture, seminar and workshop programme, students will learn independently e.g. undertaking set reading prior to each session, as well as completing formative and summative assessment tasks.",

Students will also be asked to reflect on their emerging professional identities as Gaelic-medium education practitioners.The course is situated in the current policy context, while giving a necessary historical overview within which to locate current priorities and to develop these in relation to the Gaelic-medium primary education context. The course draws on theoretical perspectives to develop students' learning for practice and articulates with the students' learning in the Professional Experience and Practice course which runs in parallel with the Education and Gaelic in Scotland Course.

    "course_description": "The bulk of the taught element of Educational Studies 4 takes place in semester one of 4th year. In the introductory phase, students engage with general principles of research design, building on what they have learnt in Educational Studies courses in years 1-3 (and equivalent courses on the MA Primary Education with Gaelic programme). Content in this phase includes ethical considerations in relation to research in educational settings, the identification of a worthwhile topic for study and the generation of appropriate research questions or hypotheses.The middle phase consists of specialist input in a range of research methods. There is an element of student choice to reflect the different kinds of research that students may want to undertake: a route provided by colleagues in Sports Science supports those students who wish to study aspects of biomechanics, sports physiology and skill acquisition in relation to primary or secondary physical education; a route that includes techniques such as critical discourse analysis which supports those students who do not wish to undertake data collection in schools or other educational settings; and a general route consisting of a range of qualitative and quantitative methods supports students undertaking a variety of qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods projects in primary and secondary schools. The teaching of research methods builds upon what students have already learned in years 1-3, enabling them to extend and deepen their knowledge, and apply it to their own research design.The final (2-week) phase considers the 'bigger picture', inviting students to reflect upon the role of research in their own practice as early career teachers, and introducing them to the complexities of the relationship between research, educational practice, and education policy.",

An 8000-word dissertation. Students must achieve at least 40% for the dissertation to achieve a pass for this courseOR2. A Literature Review (3000 words; 50% final mark) and Research Plan (4000 words; 50% final mark).  Students must achieve an average of at least 40% over these two assessment components to achieve an overall pass for the course.Formative AssessmentIf students are undertaking the dissertation mode then formal formative assessment takes place through the submission of a research proposal (all students) and completed ethical guidance form (students undertaking data collection in a school or other educational setting) at the end of semester 1. It is expected that these research proposals will have been the focus of discussion and guidance in supervision meetings and email contact, and their satisfactory completion is a condition of progression to the project itself. Students may only progress to the project phase upon submission of a satisfactory research proposal: if the proposal has not been submitted students will be advised that they are not authorised to progress and any dissertation they may submit will not be eligible to be marked. In addition, no student may carry out research in a school or other educational setting unless the ethical guidance form has been completed and signed off by the supervisor.If students are undertaking the Literature Review/Research Plan mode then formal formative assessment takes place through an on-going Â¿Research SummaryÂ¿ document (1000 words equivalent). It is expected that this document will be the focus of discussion and guidance in supervision meetings and email contact. This research summary will be submitted as part of the research plan.Students on the MA Primary Education with Gaelic programme must complete their research proposal or research summary in Gaelic and provide an English translation."

    "course_description": "This course endorses the supposition that there are a variety of valid accounts that can illuminate professional practice in schools, and, in particular, the ways teachers and pupils engage in physical education and areas of the curriculum related to health and wellbeing. The multi-various demands made of PE teachers in a rapidly evolving climate of curriculum change and in particular discourses of health and wellbeing, suggests a need for study grounded within a comprehensive synthesis of knowledge based on specialist study of physical education which is informed by professional practice and research in the field. This premise of deploying inter-disciplinary accounts give credence to a form of enquiry now required by teachers in their curriculum decision making which goes beyond a surface knowledge of their subject area (Teaching Scotland's Future, 2010).This course offers students an opportunity to draw on contemporary research in philosophy and sociology to develop a research informed perspective on how knowledge can contribute to the promotion of health and wellbeing.- Drawing on informing disciplinary knowledge from philosophy and socio-cultural studies will enable student teachers to develop a wider appreciation of factors that can influence professional practice in schools and support their preparation for creating practical contexts for teaching and learning.- The course explores the ways in which an understanding of phenomenology and the personal aesthetic could enhance professional practice and facilitate pupils' engagement, active participation and life-long learning in physical education, physical activity and sport.- The socio-cultural element of the course focuses on embodiment and lived experience by examining sociological, psychological and socio-psychological perspectives on individuals and society and their implications for physical education and health and wellbeing.",

The project is the culmination of the programme of study and as such provides a platform for students to draw upon their learning across the previous 3 years and apply gained knowledge and experience to a planned, systematic and critical investigation.2) Indicative ContentThe Honours Dissertation Project presents the student with a range of options related to the mode of study and style of presentation. The selected project will be presented in an academic style and will be 8000 words in length. The range of Dissertation options include:Â·   A review of literature focused on a topical and relevant issue pertaining to the CLD professional practice sector.Â·     Submission of a written dissertation which presents, analyses and critically discusses the findings of a small-scale research project undertaken by the student in a relevant community setting.Â·    Develop and present a CLD Practice Manifesto which engages with a topical issue or problem for the professional sector and outlines a proposed response that considers ideological, theoretical and practice implications.3) Learning ExperienceSupported by 4 hours of introductory seminars and 6 hours of supervision, the student will work independently. The Dissertation relies on good research, analytical and writing skills. Through active engagement with existing literature and research evidence the student will develop base knowledge and understanding of the topic area. This is enhanced through their own research and scholarship.",

Particular attention is paid to the study of: education as an essentially contested social practice which is nevertheless fundamental to a democratic way of life; the changing relationship between the state and civil society; the contemporary policy context and its implications for democracy and citizenship; politics and culture within the wider context of globalisation. The programme of study is based on informal seminar presentations and discussion. This approach is also intended to enable students to develop skills of selection, presentation, communication and debate that will inform and support their dissertations.Outline content:Key issues in contemporary social and educational theoryThe changing relationship between the state and civil societyPerspectives on equalities and social justiceThe educational implications of the current debate about democracy and citizenshipMaking connections between the local and global in the era of globalisationSystematic exposure to journal material and other relevant literature sourcesDeveloping skills and resources for independent studyStudent learning experience:The course takes the form of a seminar, structured around a combination of tutor input and student-led presentation and discussion. The selected papers are explored critically and collectively.Students will present an article either individually or in pairs depending on the slots available. Students will be expected to present a substantive presentation of the article Following the presentations there will be a roundtable discussion on the paper and the issues considered in each of the presentations.",

Moss and Petrie (2005), Dyson (Dyson and others 1998), Riddell and Tett (Ridell and Tett,2001) have all discussed theories of inter-agency working and we will consider the various models put forward from these studies and how they relate to professionals, children and families. In particular, the course will develop a 'strengths-based' approach to working with children and families through a critique of deficit-models of child protection. We adopt a practical approach to learning within this course where we provide discussions surrounding the theory and practice of inter-agency working. There will also be reflective exercises and practical activities for you to consider throughout.THIS COURSE IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS ON BA CHILDHOOD PRACTICE.",

In particular, you will consider how integrated working affects the provision of family, educational, childcare and social services (in terms of both its potential and its problems).We will discuss theories surrounding:- integrated working- social exclusion- equality- professionalism.These theories are very much interlinked and will be discussed in terms of practical examples. We will be asking you to evaluate your own service provision in terms of integrated working practices and what impact you feel these practices are having on childrenÂ¿s services.",

There is  a strong emphasis on interactive involvement of the students in order to develop confidence in delivery and consolidate knowledge of the language structures, thus developing their ability to communicate effectively in the classroom.Tutors will model different teaching strategies so that students can experience the different methods themselves. They will be encouraged to reflect on and evaluate on the different approaches.Tutors will support students' use of the target language as the means of communication in a class, gradually withdrawing this scaffolding as students become more confident and secure.They will learn how to organise a variety of activities and classroom tasks in the foreign language, including games, songs, story telling, introduction, revision and reinforcement of language structures.  Many of the topics of study relate to other areas of the curriculum eg. literacy, numeracy, affective language, music and expressive arts.Students will be taught how to use ICT effectively in their teaching of languages. They will have the opportunity to investigate interactive language web sites, and other sites, which offer opportunities for developing children's skills, confidence and competence in reading and writing in the foreign language.Students will be encouraged to explore a wide range of teaching strategies and resources to inform their teaching.",

    "summary": "Physical Education Perspectives (PEP3) enlists accounts of discipline-based knowledge familiar to students from the first two years of study. These have been previously described as Scientific and Aesthetic and Physical Culture forms of enquiry. PEP3 provides students with the opportunity to focus on two of the perspectives studied in years 1 and 2. It is hoped that this approach will enable students to develop more specialised knowledge and understanding of the knowledge underpinning two disciplines as they relate to practice in education, physical education, sport and physical activity. Relevant and applied disciplinary accounts can add the evolvement of professional perspectives held by student teachers, leading them to informed judgements on how physical education can contribute to pupils' development, and, enrich teaching, learning and assessment in line with the Standards for Provisional Registration (GTCS, 2012). PEP3 endorses the supposition that there are a variety of valid accounts that can illuminate work in schools, and, in particular, to the ways teachers and pupils engage in physical education. The multi-various demands made of PE teachers in a rapidly evolving climate of purpose and function for school curricula, suggests a need for study based on links between research, literature and allied knowledge to inform pedagogical practice and build teacher capacity. This premise of deploying inter-disciplinary accounts give credence to a form of study now required by teachers in their curriculum decision making, whereby they can implicitly or explicitly draw upon different combinations of in-depth knowledge to account for what they do in the school day and beyond (Teaching Scotland's Future, 2010).",
    "course_description": "AESTHETICS PERSPECTIVESThe aesthetic perspective critically evaluates aesthetic theory and concepts as they apply to physical education, physical activity and Sport. By applying an aesthetic perspective to PE and associated physical activities students will develop an understanding of how 'aesthetics' can enhance teaching, learning and assessment and promote lifelong learning and engagement in physical activity. Analysing performance from a qualitative perspective will provide a framework to equip students to analyse, develop and interpret quality performance in a number of activities.SOCIOCULTURAL PERSPECTIVEThe socio-cultural perspective critically evaluates historical and contemporary sociological, psychological and socio-psychological perspectives of people and society, considering the implications for sport and physical education. Contemporary research, literature, concepts and theories are analysed to explore the implications for policy, schooling and pedagogy within physical education.SCIENCE PERSPECTIVEScience perspectives consist of an explanation of typical pupil movement behaviours as these are influenced by growth, development and maturation allied to the demands of performance expectations (in various forms of physical education and sport). The implications for the roles teachers and coaches adopt in preparing content and pedagogy are examined. These approaches are manifest in terms of the various sub-disciplines of the science perspective, namely biomechanics, exercise physiology, skill acquisition and psychology.BiomechanicsBiomechanical principles that apply to the analysis and teaching of practical activities and reducing risk of injury are elaborated. This includes the implications of the principles for developing effective technique to perform sports skills. The course includes application of the principles to position the body and lever system to maximise force, accuracy, speed, and stability. In addition to being more effective in teaching skills, participants in this course will develop the understanding necessary to identify and correct technique faults.Exercise PhysiologyThe emphasis will be the role of exercise physiology in relation to physical activity for public health  and  lifelong  learning.  The  following  major  areas  related  to  paediatric  exercise physiology for physical education will be reviewed; The obesity crisis, Physical activity levels and opportunities, Physical activity guidelines, Energy expenditure, Aerobic responses to exercise and Growth and maturation related to aerobic fitness.Skill AcquisitionTheoretical Review 1Key terms and ideas: in particular - learning, acquisition, retention and transfer; nature of skill  environments;  performers  overcoming  movement  problems;  degrees  of  freedom; theoretical paradigms for motor control - the learner in action (practical*).Theoretical Review 2Key terms and ideas:  in particular - the relevance of environmental and cognitive theoretical perspectives  in  explaining  motor  behaviour  (bottom  up  /  top  down,  dynamical  systems theory) - relevance to organising learning (practical*).Practice schedulingKey terms and ideas:  in particular - massed distributed time scales; blocked, randomised, variable and constant conditions; contextual interference; learners as 'searchers' (practical*).FeedbackKey terms and ideas: in particular - 'feedback family'; augmented and intrinsic feedback and their consequences for learning; performance bandwidth; timing characteristics of augmented feedback; novice learners (practical*).DemonstrationKey terms and ideas: in particular - modelling; observation; beginner / expert demonstrators (practical*).Manipulating constraints to influence learningKey terms and ideas: in particular - organismic, task and environmental; perceptual-motor workspace; perception action coupling - (*student study groups will receive a practical task in which they will develop a small episode of teaching a skill within a particular theoretical framework of motor control and learning).PsychologyA range of psychological techniques to aid and enhance performance are examined together with the way in which they would be structured and delivered by student teachers. These fundamental psychological skills will be of potential interest to students in relation to their own sport performance, to their work in teaching others to perform, and more generally to performances beyond sport and the physical domain where mental factors are equally important in determining success.",

A selected number of theoretical perspectives pertaining to either philosophical aesthetics, scientific or socio-cultural perspectives will make a contribution to the wider appreciation of how student teachers prepare for teaching and learning and the factors that can influence professional practice in schools. The aesthetic element of the PEP4 Perspectives course centres on the study of the aesthetic significance of physical activities within competing visions of physical education. It also explores the ways in which an understanding of aesthetic experience could enhance professional practice and facilitate pupilsÂ¿ engagement, active participation and life-long learning in physical education, physical activity and sport. The science element offers students the opportunity to explore in more depth the applied body of knowledge pertaining to one of the following: Biomechanics, Exercise Physiology, Skill Acquisition or Sports Psychology. Students will examine the conceptual and empirical bases upon which the scientific content is founded to evaluate the assumptions that are inherent in applying principles within the professional context. The socio-cultural element examines discourses in Physical Education and critically considers the implications of them for the professional practices of specialist teachers of Physical Education. This provides students with the opportunity to examine sociological,psychological  and  socio-psychological  perspectives  on  people  and  society  and  their implications for sport and physical education.",

The multiple influences which often shape such intentions e.g. inclusion, citizenship, more effective games teaching, greater transfer from school to lifelong active learning and achieving higher sporting standards, will be analysed through lectures and seminars. These various types of sessions are designed to highlight appropriate curriculum issues and to review how these issues might impact on learning, teaching and assessment. In addition, students will be expected to review wider societal expectations of schools physical education programmes, and, in particular the links between participation in physical education programmes and participation beyond the extended school day.The main teaching and learning strategy in PECP4 is to actively involve students in discussing and reviewing different aims and conceptions of physical education. For this reason the programme includes a high number of lecture informed seminars, set reading seminars and sessions where students are expected to arrange and work together on associated tasks during private study time ahead of reporting and discussing ideas at seminar sessions. In addition, there are a number of lectures and posted lecture presentations which will introduce and frame key ideas about how various forms of physical education might be justified in school curriculum in future years. Practical sessions will familiarise students with the subject knowledge and pedagogical demands of teaching various initiatives. As such, students should have the opportunity to develop their own critical perspective on viable ideas and of learning and teaching approaches which might inform physical education curriculum in future years. Students are advised to retain the references associated with PECP4 and to continue to build a portfolio of readings that can assist with their professional development in future years.",

This course aims to introduce students to different approaches to problem solving and investigation in primary schools. It will draw on international perspectives and practices, as well as considering the context of the Scottish curriculum. Students will be expected to engage critically with both relevant mathematics education literature and curriculum policies. An essential element of this will be considering the ways in which problem solving and investigation develop children's abilities to think and reason mathematically. Practical coursework and paired micro-teaching will focus on developing students' ability to work with learners in solving problems, carrying out investigations, and problematising the learning of mathematics. The use of pairs will facilitate peer learning through collaborative preparation and observation. Students will also develop the ability to analyse and evaluate the difficulty and appropriateness of problems and investigations for different ages and stages of learning, and to construct new contexts, problems and investigations.",
    "course_description": "The course begins by considering the current place of problem solving and enquiry in primary school mathematics. The historical influence of mathematics educationalists such as George Polya, Hans Freudenthal and Paul Halmos on the teaching of problem solving is studied, and the work and writing of recent and contemporary mathematics educators is debated. We compare differing international approaches to problem solving and enquiry and contrast curriculum policy in several jurisdictions with that of Scotland. Through study and critique of these and other aspects of problem solving and enquiry,  students are encouraged to arrive at their own personal understanding of this element of mathematics education and to justify their understanding with reference to theoretical, research and policy perspectives.",

Each student will bring to this course a Personal Professional Learning Portfolio. Based on Placement 1 and from discussion with their placement tutor, it is anticipated that students will have identified specific learning targets to overtake prior to PDL1 as well as those which they would hope to address within the PDL1 course. While it is recognised that Year 3 students will be working towards the 'Standard for Registration' deemed central to their PDL1experience, it is also acknowledged that their developmental needs will vary and a degree of personalisation will be evident in relation to individual targets agreed. Achieving the 'Standard for Registration' is seen as a 'work in progress' which begins in Year 1 of the programme. Therefore, in light of the stage the student teachers are at in their developmental journey, standards (and assessment criteria) have been differentiated and modified where appropriate. The programme is however underpinned by the following core dimensions aligned with the GTCS's professional values, social justice, integrity, trust and respect (GTCS, 2012). PDL1 will generally commence late in September which should enable students to attend university for a review of their formative experiences in Year 1 & 2 of the MA (Physical Education) and attend a series of workshops specifically designed to support them as they prepare for PDL1.",

Each student will bring to this course a Personal & Professional Learning Portfolio. Students, in the final year of the MA(PE) will be expected to attain the Standard for Provisional Registration (SPR) at the end of this 11 week placement.. Assessment criteria are  based on the assumption that Year 4 students are in the final stages of working towards achieving the SPR. The PDL2 course is underpinned by the following core dimensions aligned with professional values (GTCS, 2012): social justice, integrity, trust and respect.",
    "course_description": "This focus will be provided by a Curriculum for Excellence including Health & Well Being.Students will be involved in varied aspects of school experience including teaching classes in S1- S6 under the aegis of a qualified teacher; observation of teaching; discussion with members of the PE department; attendance at departmental meetings and any other professional activities e.g. involvement, where feasible,  in extra-curricular activities deemed to be appropriate by the Principal Teacher and Student Regent. Expectations please note: this placement is the Year 4 students' first experience of engaging with upper school certificate course secondary school. It is expected that students will require considerable support as they begin their journey to becoming a teacher of PE. While they should demonstrate competence in all three areas of professional practice and take full responsibility for their own classes it is expected that opportunities to observe and team teach will be part of the process that enables them to best achieve their potential. It is also expected that PDL2  will offer opportunities for a very gradual introduction to teaching within upper school certificated courses comprising observation, team teaching and only if the student and department feel enough progress has been made, leading S5-6 certificated classes.",

When the students is having difficulties, short term targets will be agreed and an additional visit arranged by the tutor. In the event that these difficulties continue a further visit by either the course leader or, another experienced tutor will be arranged. During PDL2 an interim formative assessment of the studentÂ¿s progress will be formulated with a view to enabling realistic targets to be set which support the student in working towards a Â¿satisfactoryÂ¿ outcome. A final summative report will be completed by the school to be discussed with tutors  (and/or personal  tutor) with a view to supporting their  personal  and  professional development, on the students return to University. External examiners will visit a range of schools towards the end of PDL2 with a view to engaging with all parties, identifying good practice and offering suggestions for improvement where appropriate. Students will be assessed against the Standard for Provisional Registration but with consideration given to the stage that he/she is at in their ITE Programme. Detailed evidence should be provided to support assessment within each of the three areas (Professional Values & Personal Commitment, Professional Knowledge and Understanding, Professional Skills & Abilities).To successfully overtake the demands of PDL2 an overall Â¿satisfactoryÂ¿ grade in all three areas must be awarded by both school and tutor. A Â¿satisfactoryÂ¿ is awarded if the student has made sufficient progress for this stage of development, with an appropriate level of support. An Â¿unsatisfactoryÂ¿ is awarded if the student has not made sufficient progress, for this stage of development, even with support.Progression If studentsÂ¿ do not achieve a Â¿satisfactoryÂ¿ by the end of PDL2 they are under normal circumstances, entitled to a re-sit opportunity. While, it would be desirable to facilitate this re-sit in time for the student to commence the induction year with their cohort, this is not feasible at a number of levels. In the summer time, schools are not able to offer the range of activities or classes deemed suitable for a final placement designed to enable students to achieve the standard for provisional registration. Consequently, re-sits would be scheduled for August to November of the year in which the Â¿unsatisfactoryÂ¿ was recorded. Measures, have been put in place to ensure that a student gaining a Â¿satisfactory Â¿ re-sit is available to teach from the subsequent January and ready to commence their induction in the August of that year."

It will encourage students to explore research literature related to each perspective and provide them with opportunities to critically reflect on, and understand, the ways in which research might inform their practice as teachers of physical education. Furthermore, students will be able to apply this understanding through a series of practical tasks and micro teaching episodes. Towards the end of the course, there will be greater focus on the role of constraints in shaping motor learning, and students will consider the role that constraints and non-linear pedagogy have in the development of decision-making skills in games.",
    "course_description": "The main themes covered in this course are:1. Learning, motor skill acquisition, degrees of freedom, theories of motor learning and implications for research and practice.2. Practice scheduling - massed distributed time scales, blocked, randomised, variable and constant conditions, contextual interference and the role of search in learning.3. Feedback - 'feedback family'; augmented and intrinsic feedback and their consequences for learning. General feedback and encouraging search for unique solutions to motor problems.4. Demonstration - modelling, observation, beginner / expert demonstrators.5. Manipulating constraints to influence learning - organismic, task and environmental. Encouraging search, strengthening perception and action coupling and developing decision-making skills in games through the application of non-linear pedagogy.The course is taught through weekly lectures, seminars and practical workshops. The course content is delivered in a variety of ways i.e. whole group lectures, small seminar group discussions and student led tasks. In addition to the taught lecture, seminar and workshop programme, students will learn independently e.g. undertaking set reading prior to each session, as well as completing formative and summative assessment tasks.",

    "summary": "This course uses the Student-Led Individually Created Course (SLICC) university-wide framework for self-designed experiential learning.  It offers a highly flexible yet supported approach, where students develop their own defined experience or series of related activities and experiences with a theme, to address their own specific academic and professional demands. Students reflect regularly and throughout their defined experience, specifically by reflective blogging, which they collect and curate as a reflective e-portfolio, to provide evidence of their learning.As a participating student, undertaking a SLICC will enable you to create a learning experience which is unique to you and your own needs and academic and professional aims.  You will demonstrate your learning and academic achievement against learning outcomes in a defined experiential learning and assessment framework.This course will require you to demonstrate the development of your skills and understanding in terms of critical analysis, application, self-reflection, recognising and developing your skills and mindsets, and evaluation within the context of the learning experience you have defined. This course will also enable you to demonstrate your ability to exercise autonomy and initiative, and deal with challenges that may present themselves in an academic subject/discipline (or other approved) area, and/or at an applied professional level in practice.",
    "course_description": "A SLICC requires you to propose, develop and manage your own learning experience within a supported learning and assessment framework that will enable you to evidence how you have achieved the learning outcomes of the course.  It offers you autonomy and flexibility to address your own learning requirements, and academic and professional needs.Your self-designed learning experience is required to adhere to a defined learning and assessment framework that supports and enables you to self-direct and manage your own learning experience. Within this structure however, you have real autonomy and flexibility regarding the topic or theme, content of study and nature of your experience, provided your proposal is academically feasible, and is approved by your tutor.Your SLICC may, for example, be based upon a particular extra-curricular learning opportunity such as an internship, work experience, pro-bono activity, community engagement, volunteering, study-abroad or indeed may be entirely self-directed. In agreement with your own programme, your SLICC could also be based on your wider co-curricular range of activities in which you engage to support your main course of study, and how these contribute to your wider development.  These may include your learning and its usage and application, from what would otherwise be co- or extra-curricular activities.   It may focus on a theme of professional and /or personal interest such as sustainability, social responsibility, external engagement, equality and cultural diversity, or a disciplinary or interdisciplinary-based research theme or application.This course can enable flexibility in course delivery and curriculum design for students in their Honours years.  By way of examples, students may be working on interdisciplinary activities, in groups from different years of study.  Activities may be exploring 'wicked' or global problems, where there is a risk of achieving a perceived successful outcome, if that is defined as a project report.The steps in undertaking a SLICC are as follows:1) Identify a suitable opportunity within which to undertake your learning experience2) Write your draft proposal and submit to your tutor/advisor for approval3) Self-direct and manage your own learning experience, as detailed within the framework4) Actively and regularly reflect upon and document your experience with evidence and use that as a basis for writing your self-critical 'Interim Reflective Report', then your 'Final Reflective Report'5) Formatively self-assess and submit your 'Final Reflective Report' for summative assessment by your tutor.The steps identified above each require a significant amount of thought and input and will ultimately form part of a 'time-based' e-portfolio of reflective evidence, which you will curate and use in the assessment of your SLICC.Undertaking a SLICC you will not only develop the content of your learning experience but also produce an agreed portfolio of outputs.  You must evidence what you have learned and, importantly, where you demonstrate how you have met the learning outcomes for the course.",

With a background in TESOL, teachers would be able to contribute to the teaching of the language, understand ways to support non-native English speakers, and be better able also to acquire other languages themselves.The course is practical, and should allow much cross-reference with the content of the other courses on the Initial Teacher Education programme: for example in issues of learning styles, teacher-learner interaction, teaching methods and techniques, curricula, planning and assessment, and materials.  You will be expected to use your knowledge and understanding of the theories and principles of supporting EAL and bilingual pupils while on your school placements; this could include observation of TESOL specialists.It is expected that you will participate in building the course: you will be invited to suggest topics, activities and materials according to needs and interests.

They will begin to consider and develop their critical knowledge and understandings of pedagogy and how this is articulated in professional experience and practice.Through this site-based experience students should critically explore the ways in which sustainability can be promoted and embedded in professional practice. This should be considered both through the lens of their own values-led position as a developing professional as well as consider pedagogical and curricular implications for practice.The use of professional standards will help guide students towards reflective practice and becoming enquiring, agentic practitioners. Building partnerships continues to be essential. Students should also develop their awareness and critical understanding of the school as it is situated within the community.Professional skills of planning, implementing, assessing and modifying learning with young children are developed on through this professional experience. To address these practices, students are helped to conceptualise the classroom as a learning community and to grapple with inherent classroom management and organisational issues. A specific focus is given to deepening understanding of the school's approach to inclusive practices, considering inclusive pedagogies, additional needs, further enhancing their understanding of culturally responsive pedagogies and approaches to ensuring equity and diversity.  In addition, developing health and wellbeing for all forms a vital part of this course and aids students in their developing professionalism in the classroom.By the end of the school experience, students will have experienced taking responsibility for the learning of the class for a full week, collaboratively with their placement partner and/or supported by the class teacher. Students are expected, through practice, to develop further their understanding of relationships between curriculum, assessment and pedagogy and develop their knowledge of the relevant subject specific skills and concepts required to ensure meaningful learning progression for young people.

The use of a range of pedagogies including digital, play-based, culturally responsive and learning for sustainability will be used whilst working in collaboration with experienced practitioners. Understanding the need to develop positive relationships with the whole school community forms part of the authentic and appropriate pedagogies. Students will take an increased responsibility for the planning and teaching on placement and begin to make decisions based on appropriate practices for curriculum and assessment.By adopting a practitioner enquiry approach students will engage critically with and problematise an element of their practice. This should be focused around a core pedagogical issue and build on the conceptual pedagogical themes addressed throughout the PGDE programme. Consideration should also be given to how this articulates with conceptions of curriculum design and the ways on which broader issues of social justice, sustainability, diversity and inclusion are understood and enacted in practice.Students will need to draw on their well-developed critically informed understanding of pedagogy and learning theories to ensure they plan, implement and modify an effective programme of work involving full class responsibility for at least three weeks. They are expected to focus on their provision of a broad, balanced, progressive and coherent learning experience which will promote high achievement for all pupils. The course supports students to develop an effective strategy for class management and organization suited to the nature of the planned programme.As part of their forming professionalism students will contribute more broadly to the life and work of the school, including effective communication with colleagues. They will develop understanding of primary-secondary liaison and secondary school approaches to pedagogy, by arranging a visit/connection to an associated secondary school.The school experience develops students understanding of the relationships between teaching, learning and assessment. To achieve this, students provide a summary for the class teacher of pupil progress at the end of the five-week period and additionally, report in simulation to a member of staff or student learning partner taking the role of parent of two children in the class.",

Working from the key principle that leadership and organizational culture are broad, multidimensional and complex concepts, the course will examine selected approaches and frameworks considering their widespread implementation and development in schools and schooling i.e. from the perspective of the student, teacher, faculty, as well as whole school leadership. Specifically, contemporary leadership approaches and determinants of effective organizational culture will be outlined and critically evaluated (e.g. interactional and transformational leadership models). In addition, the benefits of developing leadership capacity at all levels of schooling will be explored, namely the potential impact it has on the learning and teaching culture, as well as attainment and achievement.",

It will empower you to organise and share your own practices of artistic learning with your peers and in public art institutions. It will enable you to engage with and practice art-as-education / education-as-art in an open and accessible way.  You will learn how to build trust and support communities of practice that extend beyond the art school.",
    "course_description": "This School of Art course will enable you to make your own contribution to opening access to and widening participation in artistic learning; it will inspire your to support your peers by codifying and sharing your practice.Art education today is porous and ubiquitous: it exists in a wide variety of formal and informal arts contexts and in can be found in many different cultures and societies. It takes many diverse organisational forms, traversing virtual communities, small artist-led initiatives, international biennials, art academies and artistic practices.The course combines and practises a range of peer-based learning theories and theories of knowledge production. You will consider how to extend online open access into the types of 'Third Places' (Soja, 1996) frequently produced by artists (galleries, schools, studios, workshops, public sites....) by learning how to practise paragogics, a set of learning principles that offer a flexible framework for peer learning and knowledge production. The course is heavily scaffolded to begin. It slowly removes this scaffold to enable peer-support for each other's learning, then, finally, requires you to lead teaching and feedback.The course is split into three parts:Part I: The Art of the Art AssignmentThe first series of workshops introduce you to D-I-T (do-it-together) and P2P (peer-to-peer) methods of artistic practice through responding to weekly art assignments. The assignments are short and simple to engage with. Your work for them forms the basis of critical discussion (critiques) each week on art-as-education and education-as-art. These critiques will take place in your small peer-support group, within which you will remain for the duration of the course.The rationale and context of each assignment is supported by a OER (open educational resource). The OER includes flipped lectures recorded in advance of the workshops which can be viewed online and supporting materials which scaffold your practice and your role as a supportive peer in crits. The OER is also a public site to which you will upload your work for each assignment. The OER enables the workshop time to focus on reviewing and setting live art assignments.At the end of Part I: you will have been given formative feedback by, and given formative feedback on, the contributions of each member of your small peer-support group.Part II: Players: Public WorkshopWork Part II centres around a workshop led by the School of Art's Art & Learning Research Group (www.eca.ed.ac.uk/research/art-learning). This will normally be run in collaboration with partner art institution so that it can be open to invited artists and the wider public.The workshop is metacognitive: taking part in it will teach you how to devise and run your own workshops. You will witness and experience what does, and does not, work in different learning environments and gain a sense of how different learners respond to artistic and educational stimuli.Part III: Contemporary Art & Open Learning EventThe final part of the course supports you to run your own workshop as part of an art and learning event held in public towards the end of this course.Your peer-group and tutor will support you to develop your personal project and will, additionally, form part of your audience during the event. Your peers will also take part in reviewing and formatively feeding back on your contribution to this event.Equally, you will support your peer-group to develop their personal projects and will, additionally, form their audience.

You will produce a Portfolio that professionally presents your research and your teaching practice for the course's cumulative Contemporary Art & Open Learning event. A digital template will be provided to scaffold the design of your folio. The Portfolio is submitted at the very end of the course. This component is summatively assessed and graded by your tutor.Learning outcome 3 is evidenced in your written critical reflection on the portfolio, situating it in an appropriate contemporary artistic and educational context. A digital template will be provided to scaffold your critical reflection. Your written critical reflection forms part of the Portfolio submitted at the very end of the course.

At a time when neo-liberal values based on the market and performativity measures are driving change in higher education it is important to look to the affective domain of learning as well as to consider questions about care, compassion and social justice in the sector.  There is a need for universities to promote positive health and well-being amongst student populations, and to address the rise in the proportions of students who are reporting mental health problems.Second, this course will address the diversity of student learners in higher education sector.  The emphasis will be on the ways in which staff can support diverse students to become successful learners.  Drawing on themes such as internationalisation, mainstreaming and inclusive practice, the course will investigate ways of encouraging a sense of belonging amongst all students, creating an inclusive curriculum and classroom, and supporting diverse students through the student lifecycle.",

They will receive a tutorial from the course tutor to discuss the resit, then usually a period of 4 weeks will be agreed for resubmission. If the student fails the resit, they will exit with a Postgraduate Certificate or transcript.The mark which will appear on Euclid, the official space where marks are announced on MyEd will reflect the first mark. This mark is used to provide an average for the whole diploma. However, the resit mark will not be capped at 50% and it will also appear on the mark sheet put to the Inclusive Education examination board.To read more about this exam regulation, please go to:  http://bit.ly/2mJyIySThe School Postgraduate Studies Committee at the School of Education agreed  during 2015/16 that this regulation would come into force from 16/17. The Scottish Association of Visual Impairment Education (SAVIE) argued that the mandatory nature of the qualification meant that it was essential that teachers of visually impaired children attain this minimum level for all specialist courses.

Students develop skills in the evaluation of numerical data through familiarity with national and international attainment surveys. Through directed study tasks, they become familiar with school mechanisms for tracking and recording pupil attainment and achievement and pupils' involvement in those activities.Using the cluster community as a site of learning, students  explore the impact of social capital on pupil attainment and wider achievement. They engage in a group problem based learning task to explore the local community and design a costed 'wider achievement 'benefit to the school community.100 student effort hours = 4 x 1hr  lecture/ blended learning whole group sessions, 3 x 2hr group seminars,  20 hours PBL,  10 hours directed study,  60 hours self study",

    "summary": "This course explores how the assessment of students and their learning is rapidly evolving in ways that capitalise on developments in digital technologies considering pedagogical and technological considerations, as well as conceptual and practical issues.  Underpinning our exploration is a review of key assessment purposes, processes and guiding principles which allows us to take a more questioning eye to newly emerging and more established directions in digital education and assessment.The purpose of this course is to provide participants with the opportunity to engage with online assessment and the issues it raises, both practically and theoretically.  It will provide the opportunity for participants to relate what they learn through the interactions and activities of the course to their own context, discipline or institution.  The course is aimed at instructors, tutors or teachers who have an interest in digital assessments and who would like to engage more deeply with aspects of the topic.Students from outwith the Digital Education programme wishing to enrol for this course or take it on a 'class only' basis must liaise directly with the course secretary before enrolling.",
    "course_description": "The course covers:*Assessment purposes and perspectives.  The course opens with an opportunity to review your experiences of being assessed and share with others your initial thoughts on what makes for a good assessment. We then turn to the fundamental question of what purposes can underlie assessment, how different 'stakeholders' tend to vary in which purposes they value most, and what tensions may arise from these differences.*Frameworks and principles.  A recurring theme in the assessment literature is the problematic interrelationship between assessment-for-grading ('summative assessment') and assessment- for-learning ('formative assessment'), allied to concerns that the former has all too often flourished at the expense of the latter. Here we invite you to take a critical look at a number of frameworks and manifestos that each seek to put assessment-for- learning to the forefront and articulate evidence-informed guiding principles.*Digital contexts and multimodal assessments.  Novel, online forms of assessment provoke new questions about what the informal ground-rules (and even the implications for more formal assessment regulations) might be.  This theme explores the implications for assessment in digital environments.  We will examine a variety of actual online assessments and consider how they open up opportunities for students to communicate what they know, understand and can do and how they ask us, as educators, to consider the interpretative role of the assessor and to re-think conventional wisdom about assessment and feedback.*Feedback, feedforward and dialogue.  Here we focus on the opportunities digital environments afford to enhance assessment-for-learning by facilitating and boosting guidance and feedback to students on their progress and performance. We will consider applications that range from comments on coursework assignments, through initiatives that enable students to self-test periodically, to electronic voting systems that provide a systematic check on how well what has been taught has been understood.*Assessment literacy.  Traditionally, assessment has been a relatively arcane and mysterious practice - understood only by those few judged sufficiently expert to be assessors in a given field and taking place in private, behind closed doors. But the mysteries of assessment have been falling away, and there has been growing recognition that itÂ¿s hard for students to perform consistently well if they donÂ¿t have a good grasp of what high-quality work looks like, and of how to go about achieving it. This Â¿insiderÂ¿ view of assessment practices is precisely what Â¿assessment literacyÂ¿ aims to develop in students. Here we explore emerging perspectives on assessment literacy and the activities designed to promote it, such as peer review and the use of exemplars.*Collaborative learning and assessment.  Digital technologies have opened up exciting new opportunities for students to work collaboratively, whether through new forms of communication and interaction as they pursue shared or pooled tasks, or through co-authoring tools that allow writing and revising of joint publications, presentations or other output.  But assessing such collaborative activities also poses tricky issues for educational systems that have traditionally evaluated and rewarded individual rather than group endeavour and where the borderlines between cooperation and collusion may be fuzzy rather than clear-cut.   During this theme we will tease out some of our own ways of working collaboratively in preparation for our own group-based assessment.*Emerging themes and the Â¿big questionsÂ¿ assignment.  Here we explore some of the emerging challenges that new technologies might bring to traditional understandings of the relationship between teacher, student and assessment.  We will also be engaging in our group-based assessment for the course, our 'Big Questions' assignment.ALDE, as with all our courses, is delivered entirely online, using as its main delivery platform the virtual learning environment Moodle, but also making extensive use of environments for collaborative working and assessment (e.g. wiki, Google Doc) and synchronous sessions (e.g. Skype, Adobe Connect, Discord).The approach to teaching in the course takes various forms. Most weeks will include guided core and follow-up reading from a range of sources, alongside various activities like forum discussions, group authoring, and synchronous seminars.  In particular, in this course, we value sharing our experiences and insights with one another, alongside what we discover along the way Â¿ a new idea or application, for instance, or an unfamiliar term that can be put to good use. And through the assignments, you will have the chance to review developments in digital assessment in a field of your own choosing.Successful participation in this course will require around 7-10 hours a week in discussion, reading, exploration and writing, with more than this likely around the time of assignment completion. As suggested in the introduction to this handbook, you will need to make a significant commitment to the course in order to contribute to class discussions, activities and the collaborative work. We would recommend logging in to Moodle almost every day to keep track of class discussions.  You will also need to set aside good chunks of time three or four times a week for undertaking course activities, doing the readings and keeping apace with the course work.",

    "course_description": "Academic description:This course takes a psychological perspective on understanding cognitive and social development in infants, children, and young people (and in some cases adults) with intellectual/developmental disabilities. The course has a strong focus on autism, but also explores, Down's syndrome, fragile X syndrome, Williams syndrome and non-specific intellectual disabilities.The course begins by exploring some of the broader issues in this field. Psychological research is placed in context, as one of a range of approaches to understanding developmental disabilities. Indeed, throughout the course, students are encouraged to reflect upon the merits and limitations of Psychological approaches to this field of enquiry. Students are also asked to critically engage with some key broad theoretical approaches used to understand developmental disabilities in this discipline (e.g. behavioural phenotype approach). There is also discussion of how knowledge of developmental disabilities can inform, and be informed by, theories of 'typical' development, a theme which is returned to throughout the course.Each week students are then asked to explore the research and theories around a key topic in this field. In particular, there is consideration of cognitive and social development in autism and across a range of other developmental disabilities. Students are asked to critically engage with the research on this, exploring evidence for e.g. distinctive profiles of development, changes with age, key influences on development, and whether development is quantitatively or qualitatively different from typical development. The implications of developmental disabilities for young people's quality of life/socio-emotional well-being, for interventions and education, and for family adjustment will also be explored, and the research evidence (or lack of evidence) in these areas will be considered.Throughout the course, students are encouraged to consider development holistically, considering the two-way relationship between the individual and their environment (e.g. family), and the role that societal and cultural factors play in development, and in the life experiences of those with developmental disabilities.During the course there will be a focus on both classic and recent research findings, and through this, participants will develop a critical awareness of relevant research methods. Students are also encouraged, where appropriate, to consider the impact of research methods, theories and research findings on the lives and communities of individuals with developmental disabilities. Issues around terminology, the way in which communities and participants are involved in the research process, and other methodological and ethical issues surrounding research in this field are also considered.Outline content:There will be 10 weekly classes. In each, students will explore a current issue in the developmental psychology research on developmental disabilities. This will include a focus on: general and specific theories of developmental disabilities (e.g. cognitive theories of autism); specific aspects of cognitive or social development (e.g. theory of mind, memory, executive functions, friendship); interventions and education; family experiences. The course is largely structured according to areas of development (e.g. social, cognitive), rather than according to different developmental disabilities. This is to encourage consideration of domain-general issues and influences, and factors that are similar or differ across different developmental disabilities. Throughout the course there will be discussion of methodological and ethical issues surrounding research in this field.Student learning experience:In weekly classes, students will be asked to engage with a range of learning experiences, including: interactive lecture content; video clips; small and whole group discussion; small group tasks (e.g. designing research-informed interventions); and (where possible) input from guest speakers.Outwith classes, students will be asked to undertake and reflect on reading before each class. Reading is predominantly of quantitative research, but no prior knowledge of research methods in this field is assumed. Students will also be encouraged to develop the academic literacy skills required for the final assignment by engaging with resources provided in class and via other sources (e.g. Institute for Academic Development).Students will be expected to evidence and demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes via discussion, input into group activities, and, ultimately, the final written summative assignments.",

The course supports, informs, and develops understanding of how people learn and use language across their communicative repertoire. The course is aimed at students developing expertise in the complexities, constraints, and practicalities of bilingual/multilingual learning and teaching in bilingual/multilingual contexts.The course explores the main concepts, theories, principles, controversies and ideologies in current bilingual and multilingual research and practice including: bilingual language education policies, the role of language as a learning tool and as a resource, developing pluriliteracies, the psychology of how learners learn their languages and literacies, multilingualism and cognition, translanguaging as a practice and as a process, multilingual digital literacies, bilingual identity in learners and teachers, bilingualism and power/status in the classroom, and bilingualism, 'race', ethnicity and anti-discrimination.The course introduces and puts forward concepts, theories, principles, and controversies regarding how bilingual/multilingual people communicate and develop their understanding and potential in various social and educational contexts, with a focus on bilingual/multilingual educational contexts. These bilingual/multilingual contexts may be personal, classroom-based, institution-based, or societal. The latest research on these issues is valuable for informing institutional practice and policy development and enabling our students to be at the forefront of developments in bilingual/multilingual education around the world.",
    "course_description": "This 20-credit course will be delivered over eight contact weeks in a structured series of lectures with accompanying workshops, followed by a Q&A session in support of the assignment.Course members will engage with, discuss, and consider the following bilingual and multilingual research areas, contexts, theories and ideologies over the course together with how we evaluate them through the research methods available to us:-\tOverview of bilingualism/ multilingualism and literacies research, including translanguaging as psychological process and as social and pedagogical practice.-\tOverview of bilingualism as a resource in schools (teachers, parents and policies) and valuing linguistic resources of bi/multilingual learners.-\tLanguage policy models of bilingual education.-\tBilingualism and power/status in the classroom (countering deficit models of linguistic difference). Bilingualism, race, ethnicity and anti-discrimination.-\tBilingualism as a learning tool in bilingual settings, including Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL), content-based language learning.-\tHeritage and community bilingual education; bilingual immersion education.-\tBilingual and multilingual learners and how they learn languages and literacies, including the concepts of pluriliteracies, multiliteracies, and multilingual digital literacies.-\tLearner and teacher identities and how these affect classroom practices, using a critical framework to explore these concepts.Workshops will enable students to explore the issues arising from each week's lecture in relation to different contexts of communication and learning through supported discussion and debate in a collaborative environment. The workshops will also enable students to develop practical skills in data analysis relevant to the assignment area. The course uses English as a medium of instruction with all class members welcome to use other languages at will provided that all in the communication group can understand or have their understanding supported in real time.Achievement of the following course learning outcomes will be assessed by one formative assessment (a presentation) and one summative assessment (a small-scale research project) with all information accessible through the course LEARN pages including the presentation, submission, and hand-back dates.",

The course will cover the role of technology in children's everyday lives; and the more explicit use of technology to enhance learning, including children learning to be creators, as well as critical consumers, of technology.",
    "course_description": "The course is intended as an introduction to the role of digital technology in children's lives at home and school. The course can be considered in terms of three main areas.Technology in children's livesThe first sessions will focus on the role of technology in children's everyday lives from the society they live in to their own homes. The course will provide students with an understanding of the prevalence of technology, particularly for younger children, and the need to consider how different factors (e.g. parents) influence children's interaction with technology.Technology Enhanced LearningThe next sessions will focus on the use of technology to specifically support learning. This will mainly focus on technology in educational contexts e.g. school, and address the importance of critically reflecting upon definitions of learning in this context. The course will provide students will an overview of the impact of technology in education, and the challenges of considering all the factors influencing such impact (e.g. teacher skills, infrastructure).Children as creators of technologyTwo sessions including a hands-on workshop will look at the increasing emphasis on children learning the skills to understand and generate new technologies: from programming outside of school to the introduction of computing as a curriculum subject in different national curricula. Students will be given the opportunity to explore types of technology to support a critical perspective of how such experiences may support childrenÂ¿s wider development.In all three areas above, there will be an emphasis on examining the research methods used to investigate the role of technology, and the challenges involved in this particular field of research (e.g. the evolving nature of technology, difference in how technology is integrated). This will develop students' critical reflection of various claims made for, and against, children'ss use of technology at home and school.There will also be a final session in this course looking at the ethical and safety issues surrounding research and the use of technology by children (e.g. online safety, data collection).The course will benefit from illustrations from recent world-leading research conducted at Moray House, where students will be encouraged to become familiar with the research activities, such as through the current website http://www.children-and-technology.ed.ac.uk",

    "course_description": "Academic descriptionThis interdisciplinary course draws on theoretical frameworks and research findings from Developmental Psychology, Childhood Studies and Youth Studies to explore two broad interlinked aspects of children and young people's lives:-\tPositive relationships and emotional wellbeing-\tSocial justice and community engagementThe course begins by briefly comparing and evaluating the key assumptions and research methods associated with several disciplines used to understand the lives of children and young people (including education, psychology, sociology and social policy), drawing on classic work such as Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems theory (1979) and C. Wright Mill's (1959) Sociological Imagination to understand how these different disciplines inform knowledge of the lives of children and young people. The course then goes on to use classic and contemporary theory and research to explore the two themes in detail, critically considering:- how these aspects are considered within key policies, including the Curriculum for Excellence and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.- the micro- and macro- influences on these aspects of the lives of children and young people, including social, economic, political, cultural and generational influences, with particular attention paid to issues of inequality and intersectionality- the extent to which educators influence these aspects of the lives of children and young people- children and young people's rights and the extent to which they actively influence these aspects of their own lives.Throughout, the course will include a particular focus on issues around transition experiences for children and young people (e.g. from nursery to primary, into secondary, and post-school transition). The timing of the course allows for a specific practical focus on pre-transition issues.During the course, students' campus-based studies will be complemented by site-based learning in educational/community settings, allowing them to develop a critical awareness of current issues relating to the lives of children and young people, and to actively engage in consideration of how drawing upon research evidence from social science disciplines can enable them to affect change in the lives of the children and young people with whom they work.Student Learning ExperienceThe course includes:- on-campus classes, which will take the form of seminars, panel discussions, and small group activities (10 hours)- self-directed study, which will include reading, seminar preparation, assessment work, and site-based learning (90 hours)",

    "course_description": "In professional contexts, including schools coaching and mentoring takes many forms, and is commonly conceived as a means of offering personalised professional support to teachers through discussion about their practice. The very many definitions of coaching and mentoring demand an evidence base to assist with understanding the convergence and distinctions between these concepts, and with situating them in relation to professional practice.Through this course, students will critically explore the underpinning principles of differing models and approaches to coaching and mentoring, including directive and non-directive approaches. The distinctions and nuances between coaching and mentoring will be investigated.  Key professional learning models will be examined to understand the role coaching and mentoring may have to support teacher professional learning.Core skills and professional dispositions will be examined and developed, including understanding the importance of relationship building, challenging one's own beliefs, assumptions and dispositions; developing inter-personal skills; building capacity in others; developing coaching skills and tools.Through this course students will initiate and develop, a formal, supportive relationship with at least one other colleague, to develop & apply the key skills of coaching and/or mentoring. Through this process they will become more aware of the resulting impacts of these approaches when applied in context.The course content is delivered in a variety of ways i.e. whole group lectures, small seminar group discussions and student-led tasks. In addition to the taught lecture and seminar programme, students will learn independently e.g. undertaking set reading prior to each session, as well as completing formative and summative assessment tasks. Participants will also engage in coaching conversations and establish peer coaching networks.",

    "course_description": "This course is designed to enable students to demonstrate specialist knowledge and understanding of collaborative working in children's services. Taking schools, nurseries, out of school care, youth/community work and family work (including integrated teams and children/family centres) as its focal point, it will enable students to consider issues of inter-professional collaboration.  Students will be required to demonstrate a systematic understanding and knowledge of the key issues of collaborative working including inter-personal skills, self-assessment, joint assessment, participation/emancipation, power/hierarchy and the gaps in social policy. This will include the ability to demonstrate a critical awareness of the different definitions of integrated working and different theories (e.g. psychological, medical, social, anthropological, sociological, pedagogical etc) that underpin practice. In particular the course will consider contemporary research that has identified key problems in integrated working and students will be required to assess the impact of this on their own practice. Students will consider how to tackle and solve problems in the work place, act autonomously (e.g. when developing assessments and reports for planning groups) and take part in professional planning meetings. Students will be required to establish techniques of research/enquiry, develop their own initiative and analyse complex situations.  They will develop critiques of taken for granted practice (e.g. in relation to the labelling of parents and children) whilst considering best practice in relation to specific case studies (including those concerning Visual Impairment, Hearing Impairment, Restorative Justice, Disability, Young Carers, Child Protection and First Nation People).This course will enable students to become critically aware of theoretical principles and processes that underpin interpersonal skills in education and childrenÂ¿s services including issues of change management, leadership, risk and responsibility. We have developed the course so that participants can critically reflect on their own theoretical constructs of childhood, the constructs of other professionals and compare them to a range of theories that underpin professional practice with parents and children (including psychological, medical, social, anthropological, sociological, pedagogical and those that relate to the early years). Critically compare and contrast theories of child development, family/individual therapy, ecological/environmental models, notions of childrenÂ¿s rights/agency and post-structural approaches to childrenÂ¿s services.The course will also allow students to source and compare different national and international academic writing on integrated working, disability, family work, parenting, childrenÂ¿s services and diverse family types and to develop techniques for discussing issues of integrated working with specialist and non-specialist audiences.Participants will also consider diverse childhoods, practical contexts and the policy implications of issues of inclusion, social justice, respect and anti-discrimination e.g. in relation to issues such as culture, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, linguistic access, religion, disability, poverty.",

These imperatives will require agencies to develop new approaches and methods to help them make their engagements both meaningful and effective.These approaches and methods are grounded in an ethical value base which:Respects the experience of communities and seeks to understand the hopes, fears and aspirations of people as a starting point for engagement and the development of curriculum.Implements methodological approaches to the development of curriculum which are dialogical and co-constructed to reflect the interests of communities and agencies alike.Accepts the premise that people will act to change the conditions which inhibit and disrupt their full participation.",

This will be supported by a series of visits to mainstream and specialist schools and settings in Edinburgh.Whilst inclusive and special education has taken a distinctive turn in Scotland, this is in relation to worldwide developments, including those associated with development education as well as those directly pertaining to inclusive and special education.

The course will introduce students to corpus linguistics as a means of investigating language use with the help of computer tools, and it will encourage students to explore a range of corpora representing several languages and/or language varieties.  The course will focus on how corpora and corpus tools can be used for teaching, learning and research purposes.  It will introduce students to the use of, for example, word frequency lists, keyword lists and concordance lines in order to investigate recurrent language patterns - both in terms of form and function. With regard to the pedagogical applicability of corpus linguistics, the course will focus on how teachers and students can use corpora in the language classroom (e.g. the use of corpus findings to inform materials design, the design of data-driven learning tasks).",

Participants will be encouraged to reflect on their own school and classroom context, increase their understanding of those processes which can be inclusive or exclusive for pupils and investigate the ways in which curriculum content and methodology, ethos of school and classroom, as well as structures of pastoral care, can be both sources of difficulty and of support.Building on previous learning in research methods, participants will develop an understanding of approaches to situational analysis. Using their situational analysis as baseline data, participants will devise a plan to undertake a development project that is intended to promote effective responses to diversity.",

After considering the Intercultural as a site of struggle based on situated power interests and ideologies, the course will focus on a range of topics which scholars of critical intercultural communication have explored over the past 20 years. Topics covered include global movements, migration and migratory politics, the logic of capitalism and the consumption of places, and popular culture and the media. The implications such work has for intercultural praxis will also be addressed in relation to the ethics of intercultural communication. Students taking this course can expect to discuss critically issues arising from these topics in order to reflect on the ways in which they can go about becoming responsible researchers of Intercultural Communication.",
    "course_description": "The course Critical Topics in Intercultural Communication Studies aims to offer students an interdisciplinary course to problematise key issues associated with the field of Intercultural Communication (e.g., Racism, Migration, Social Justice, Equality, Social Movements). These critical topics will be approached from critically oriented and theoretically grounded interdisciplinary research (e.g., in drawing on research from Philosophy, Political Science and Sociology). Students will engage in pedagogically innovative practices during workshops to develop their criticality and reflectively thinking skills. The course is pertinent given the social immediacy of the issues discussed in the course contents (e.g., discussions on decolonialisation and racism). In this sense, the course Critical Topics in Intercultural Communication Studies offers critical perspectives in addressing (and redressing) key issues in society and in the field of Intercultural Communication.",

Consequently, emphasis will be placed on:-\tdeveloping studentsÂ¿ understanding of the ways in which literacy is embedded in particular sociocultural practices;-\tintroducing them to important concepts within critical literacy theories such as power; marginalization; the dynamic, unstable and evolving nature of Â¿textsÂ¿; and countertexting;-\tdeveloping studentsÂ¿ understanding of the various metalanguages required to a rich and varied range of Â¿textsÂ¿;-\thelping students to move between theoretical understandings of critical literacy and to consider how  such understandings can impact on their professional contexts.",
    "course_description": "Indicative contentEach session will have a key focus:1.\tWhat do we mean when we talk about literacy? This session examines the ways in which literacy is constructed in society across different cultures and considers who determines what Â¿literacyÂ¿ is and what it means to be Â¿literateÂ¿.  Students will examine the ways in which literacy is constructed in their own cultures, and which aspects of literacy are valued, by analysing culturally-located test of literacy;2.\tDifferent theoretical understandings of critical literacy are introduced through tutor input on the historical development of critical literacy theory and a focus on seminal thinkers and theorists. In this way significant debates and contested areas will be introduced. These are revisited as part of ongoing seminar work and in tutor-designed tasks;3.\tAnalysis of texts is introduced early in the course and revisited throughout. In looking closely at such texts students will learn about the dynamic and shifting nature of the definition of text in the 21st century. They will also learn how to use the different languages required to analyse such texts Â¿ the languages of conventional literary criticism, visual literacy and media literacy, framed through critical literacy theory;4.\tRepresentations of literacy in fiction and in life will be analysed and then compared and contrasted with its representation in studentsÂ¿ lived experiences;5.\tCountertexting and transformation are important and valuable responses to texts, and they are introduced and developed in relation to texts of the studentsÂ¿ own choosing;6.\tLearner autonomy and sharing power Â¿ tensions and risk. This session is based on a group reading of Ira Shor and looks at the complexity of critical pedagogy in practice. The text looks at the difficult experiences and the loss of hope Shor felt when the theory did not work.  The session then moves on to consider confronting controversial issues in order to manage risk/explore risk through critical literacy;7.\tThis session will focus on reading picturebooks/curiousity/creating space for critical literacy and critical thinking using Shaun TanÂ¿s The Lost Thing with Â¿poor readersÂ¿;8.\tCritical literacy and adult learners; this session, which will focus on adults who, for many and complex reasons, did not become literate in the accepted sense during their years of compulsory education. This session will examine the disempowerment and exclusion they have experienced because of this, and will explore how critical literacy can be used to empower.9.\tThis session will consider the application of theoretical perspectives on critical literacy and critical pedagogies in studentsÂ¿ own contexts/professional areas (this will be a formatively assessed task).",

The aims of this course are achieved through core themes related to: curriculum; learning and teaching; research, equalities, diversity, values, sustainability and teacher identity.This course prepares student teachers in pedagogical and curricular learning, as well as providing opportunities for professional development, necessary for the delivery of high quality Expressive Arts or Physical Education provision within the Scottish primary school sector, in line with the GTCS Standards for Provisional Registration.",
    "course_description": "A range of effective pedagogies, strategies, structures and techniques are considered, investigated and critically analysed through practical, activity based workshops. Students learn through cognitive apprenticeship, social pedagogy and experiential learning methodologies, exploring ideas and approaches to teaching, learning and assessment from both the perspective of the pupil and of the teacher. Models of effective practice are experienced and explored practically, before being deconstructed and critically investigated in terms of related pedagogical theories, method, strengths and potential issues in practice. The approaches outlined here exemplify a core commitment to reflective and reflexive praxis, where the values that underpin how, why and what we teach inform our actions.  This helps student teachers to broaden their pedagogic understanding from being solely classroom based, and to extend to include aspects of citizenship and belonging in the wider community.  Students are therefore supported in closing the gap between what they value and how they act in the world.In addition, students' critical engagement with a wide range of relevant academic literature, educational policy and legislation, analysed within their sociopolitical/historical contexts, underpins this experience. Subsequent critical analysis, through the employment of a range of theoretical perspectives helps student teachers to analyse and evaluate pedagogical approaches that can be refined and adapted to work effectively within a primary setting and context.Ideally, the course will include a brief primary school experience, if available. This experience takes place either during Block Placement 1or 2. Experience of working within the primary school introduces students to the potential of becoming a peripatetic, specialist teacher working within the primary sector.",

The focus of the teaching is application of theory to classroom practice in traditional and non-traditional learning spaces. This SCQF level 11 course helps student teachers to engage in new ways of thinking and engaging in practice as they develop the knowledge, skills and dispositions needed for 21st century classrooms. The course enables student teachers to draw on principles of sustainability, social justice, citizenship, linguistic and cultural diversity and inclusion to critique, analyse and reflect on the wider landscape of Scottish education, and the changing nature of a more global educational context.The four strands of this programme (Critical Literacy; Teaching in Multiliterate Classrooms; Learning in the Outdoors and Philosophy with Children) have been designed to engage PGDE Secondary students in aspects of learning and teaching which will enhance their efficacy and understanding of how to apply these teaching architectures to their practice. Study of these strands will give students the opportunity to reflect critically on the multi-faceted role of teachers in the secondary school in terms of effective and innovative teaching and learning. In addition, study of these strands will address our core commitments to education where we support student teachers in thinking critically about moving beyond their subject areas, and to build a pedagogic repertoire that enables them to challenge discrimination in all its forms, respecting disciplines, languages and cultures within the student population and beyond. As such, this course supports the philosophy of life-long professional learning and reflexive praxis.",

This preparation is firmly in accordance with the GTCS Standard for Provisional Registration and takes full account of the Donaldson Review of Teacher Education (2010).Students work and learn in multi-disciplinary groups, exploring the implications and expectations of educational theory being employed effectively in practice. As the key part of this process, students are required to read and respond critically and analytically to research based literature, educational policy and government legislation relating to a wide range of salient issues, themes and topics, including inclusive pedagogies and diversity in education.In sum, this course teaches, guides and encourages student teachers to engage in: reflective and reflexive practice; individual and collaborative based  critical engagement with relevant and contemporary academic literature and professional documentation. The overarching aim is to improve and develop students; professional skills and abilities, knowledge and understanding, in order to enable them to become an informed and effective classroom practitioner, as well as an agent of educational change and future improvement.",

A range of teaching and learning approaches will be used including direct teaching, task based collaborative learning, student presentations, whole group and small group discussion, reflection, evaluation and enquiry. This approach enables the course to address our commitment to reflective and reflexive praxis, where the values that underpin how, why and what we are teaching inform our actions. There is a particular emphasis on students acting as guides and explainers for others whose specialism lies beyond their own, which enables students to built a pedagogic repertoire that is responsive to both local and global educational and social values of sustainability, equality, equity and justice. Sessions are also designed to offer the opportunity for students to learn with and from each other, as part of interdisciplinary tasks, interactive activities and experiential activities.

It includes an overview of (1) the importance of a robust research design to address specific research questions, (2) the principles on which good research designs are based and (3) the strengths and limitations of various research designs. The course will enable students to evaluate the soundness of the research design used in published educational research and understand and interpret the main arguments for employing different designs.",
    "course_description": "Session 1What is Research Design? Specification of the Research Problem and Research ObjectivesThe specification of research questions (i.e. what is to be studied) and research design (i.e. how to conduct the study) is an extremely important part of any research project. But where do we start from? And how do we go about finding the right research design for our study? This session will introduce the process of designing a research project and will discuss the different research purposes associated with different research designs. Ethical issues in research design will also be briefly discussed.Session 2Examples of Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Designs: SurveysCross-sectional and longitudinal designs are most typically associated with survey data collection methods (e.g. structured interviews and questionnaires). However these types of design can be used in association with qualitative research methods (covered in the next session). In this session we will focus on surveys, in particular on issues of sampling, measurements and methods of data collection. We will cover the use of secondary data in research and discuss issues of primary data collection. Moreover, strengths and limitations of using these types of design will be discussed.Session 3Examples of Qualitative Research Designs: Interpretative Research.This session will consider contrasting positions within qualitative research designs, including theory driven research, as well as more inductive approaches. The broad focus however will be to highlight critical stages in the process of undertaking qualitative research. This will include justifications for selecting particular methods, formulating questions for interviews and focus groups and strategies for the analysis of data. On-going attention will be given to the importance of research ethics and the way in which ethical issues can arise over the course of the research enterprise.Session 4Examples of Mixed-Methods DesignsA mixed methods research design is a procedure for collecting, analysing, and \"mixing\" both quantitative and qualitative research in a single study to better understand a research problem. This design is implemented when the use of one type of research (qualitative or quantitative) is not considered satisfactory to address the research problem or answer the research questions. This session will examine various ways in which quantitative and qualitative research can be combined: sequentially e.g. 1) follow-up a quantitative study qualitatively to obtain more detailed information or 2) explore an issue qualitatively then develop a quantitative instrument, or concomitantly, i.e. when both methods are used in parallel. It will also discuss the challenges of combining different paradigms, of interpreting and reporting results derived from data collected with different types of research instruments.Session 5Examples of Desk Based Research DesignsThe last session of Designing Educational Research will be used to focus on discussing examples of desk based research in education. Students will be guided through a range of desk based research designs, including systematic reviews, historical research as well as philosophical research in education. This session demonstrates students the value of engaging with non-empirical research and will both strengths and limitations of desk based approaches will be discussed.Teaching will usually be spread over 5 weeks and will consist of 5 blocks of 2.5 contact hours per week. Each session might start with an introductory powerpoint presentation. The majority of the time of the contact sessions will be used to engage in critical reflections on selected materials, group work and discussions.Study activity\tTime commitment (in hours)Face-to-face teaching-learning activities \t12.5Pre-course reading and preparation\t30Feedback/feedforward\t2.5Collecting and consulting other materials\t15Preparation and writing assignment\t40Total\t100h",

In particular, the course supports several themes arising from \"Teaching Scotland's Future\" (Donaldson, 2011), namely: a reconceptualised approach to 'teacher professionalism'; greater partnership between universities, schools and local authorities and professional learning at Masters level.The conceptualisation of the programme as a whole draws on international research on teacher education, which suggests that 'The most powerful programs require students to spend extensive time in the field throughout the entire program, examining and applying the concepts and strategies they are simultaneously learning about in their courses' (Darling-Hammond, 2006, p. 307). The DTP course actively supports that endeavor by providing an explicit link between different sites of learning (university and school/community) which focuses on the central aim of developing teacher professionalism. Through the DTP course, and its attention to how teachers learn, students will be able to make explicit their own pedagogical aims, engaging in constructivist, critically-informed and transparent teaching which reflects the activist conception that we wish our students to aspire to and enact.The placing of clusters of students in school clusters for site-based learning will enable them to develop their identity as a teacher in a way that takes cognisance of the environment in which their pupils live and learn, providing opportunities for students to work with parents and other professional as well as a broad range of teachers. The DTP course will support students in mapping and planning their professional learning in the programme as a whole, against a developing personal philosophy of teaching with transformative aims at its core.The DTP course has four central elements that run throughout:SELF AND OTHERSUnderstanding and articulating own professional values and identity, understanding and articulating 'the cultural self', understanding others through theories of sociology and social justice, developing activist practices for social justice.TEACHER AS INQUIRERConcept of 'inquiry as stance' (Cochran Smith & Lytle, 2009), developing professional research skills, problematising practice, adopting an activist stance to research and inquiry.TEACHER AS PEDAGOGICAL EXPERTUnderstanding different pedagogical approaches, e.g. pedagogies of place, early years pedagogies, critical pedagogy, culturally responsive pedagogy, restorative practices.TEACHER AS LEARNERUnderstanding teachers as learners: processes of professional, lifelong learning, policy context for professional learning, developing reflective and planning skills, developing professional networks within and beyond the programme, including international links.DTP will be taught principally through seminar-based activities, requiring students to have undertaken reading, observation and other activities in their cluster schools. Students will be supported by tutors, peers and school-based colleagues to engage critically with the GTCS Standard for Provisional Registration throughout the course, planning, reflecting on, and evidencing their progress as they build towards the final professional viva in which they will present evidence of having met the Standard for Provisional Registration.The course will comprise 9 hours of whole group teaching and 21 hours of smaller group teaching.

    "course_description": "Academic description:This course takes a psychological perspective on understanding cognitive and social development in infants, children, and young people (and in some cases adults) with intellectual/developmental disabilities, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Down's syndrome, fragile X syndrome, Williams syndrome and non-specific intellectual disabilities.The course begins by exploring some of the broader issues in this field. Psychological research  is placed in context, as one of a range of approaches to understanding developmental disabilities. Indeed, throughout the course, students are encouraged to reflect upon the merits and limitations of Psychological approaches to this field of enquiry. Students are also asked to critically engage with some key broad theoretical approaches used to understand developmental disabilities in this discipline (e.g. behavioural phenotype approach). There is also discussion of how knowledge of developmental disabilities can inform, and be informed by, theories of 'typical' development, a theme which is returned to throughout the course.Each week students are then asked to explore the research and theories around a key topic in this field.  In particular, there is consideration of cognitive and social development across a range of developmental disabilities. Students are asked to critically engage with the research on this, exploring evidence for e.g. distinctive profiles of development, changes with age, key influences on development, and whether development is quantitatively or qualitatively different from typical development. The implications of developmental disabilities for young people's quality of life/socio-emotional well-being, for interventions and education, and for family adjustment will also be explored, and the research evidence (or lack of evidence) in these areas will be considered.Throughout the course, students are encouraged to consider development holistically, considering the two-way relationship between the individual and their environment (e.g. family), and the role that societal and cultural factors play in development, and in the life experiences of those with developmental disabilities.During the course there will be a focus on both classic and recent research findings, and through this, participants will develop a critical awareness of relevant research methods. Students are also encouraged, where appropriate, to consider the impact of research methods, theories and research findings on the lives and communities of individuals with developmental disabilities. Issues around terminology, the way in which participants are involved in the research process, and other methodological and ethical issues surrounding research in this field are also considered.Outline content:There will be 10 weekly classes. In each,  students will explore  a  current issue in the developmental psychology research on developmental disabilities. This will include a focus on: general and specific theories of  developmental disabilities (e.g. cognitive theories of autism); specific aspects of cognitive or social development (e.g. theory of mind, memory, executive functions, friendship); interventions and education; family experiences. The course is largely structured according to areas of development (e.g. social, cognitive), rather than according to different developmental disabilities. This is to encourage consideration of domain-general issues and influences, and factors that are similar or differ across different developmental disabilities. Throughout the course there will be discussion of methodological and ethical issues surrounding research in this field.Student learning experience:In weekly classes, students will be asked to engage with a range of learning experiences, including: interactive lecture content; video clips; small and whole group discussion; small group tasks (e.g. designing research-informed interventions); individual and group presentations, and (where possible) input from guest speakers.Outwith classes, students will be asked to undertake and reflect on reading before each class. Reading is predominantly of quantitative research, but no prior knowledge of research methods in this field is assumed. Students will also be encouraged to develop the academic literacy skills required for the final assignment by engaging with resources provided in class and via other sources (e.g. Institute for Academic Development).Students will be expected to evidence and demonstrate their achievement of the intended learning outcomes via discussion, presentation, input into group activities, and, ultimately, the final written summative assignment.",

The course will be hosted on Moodle where select discussion will take place; this will be complemented by Zotero, where students will engage in group activities towards the creation of a collaborative research artefact by the end of the course.In keeping with the theme of localised configurations of technology, students will be asked to perform methodological work with several technologies of increasing use in the Global South: participatory mapping applications; mobile authoring platforms designed to create engagement with particularly marginalised or vulnerable communities; and learning management systems that provide offline/online access to curriculum and education content for areas with poor connectivity are examples of technologies the course will engage with.Students will be asked to reflect on and critique these experiences in each of these technological spaces and relate them to the core literature the course is exploring. They will be encouraged to consider the broader social and political implications of these digital technologies and the role that participatory and design methodologies might have in further populating the field of digital education with examples that have fidelity to the lived experiences of underrepresented audiences.",

This is done through activity along several parallel lines of inquiry: research, conceptual framing, localised technology, and methodological experimentation. This course will engage students in a critical understanding of the principal theories, concepts and principles, and a range of specialised theories, concepts and principles (ujamaa, jugaad, ushahidi, buen vivir). The course is designed to engender a critical awareness of current issues in a subject/discipline/sector and one or more specialisms.Characteristic 2: Practice: Applied Knowledge, Skills, and Understanding Apply knowledge, skills and understanding: on completion of the course, students will have the ability to use a significant range of the principal professional skills, techniques, practices and/or materials associated with the subject/discipline/sector. In the course, this is engendered through critical technological and methodological experimentation with approaches of common use in the field. This methodological experimentation also allows for the student to be able to apply a range of standard and specialised research and/or equivalent instruments and techniques of enquiry.Characteristic 4: Communication, ICT, and Numeracy. On completion of the course, students will have the ability to communicate, using appropriate methods, to a range of audiences with different levels of knowledge/expertise. This is most readily engendered on the course through the assessments, which are designed to be knowledge artefacts in and of themselves that speak to diverse audiences. Further, the course is explicit about the use of a wide range of ICT applications to support and enhance work at this level and adjust features to suit purpose.",

The course critically examines the key influences on strategy and policy at national and organisational levels. We will investigate different approaches to conceptualising and implementing different approaches to digital learning in organisations. We will discuss and explore the organisational implications of developing different approaches to digital education and how these interface with issues of pedagogy and technology and the resource implications for institutions.Participants will be encouraged to read and discuss some of the theoretical background to policy and strategy setting as these may apply to their organisation, and to contribute discussion materials, either from their own organisation or from publicly-available sources. Case studies will offer opportunities to examine some practical instances of digital education and learning strategies. Participants will be supported in applying and critiquing the concepts and tools of strategy making to their own organisation.The course draws on literature from public policy, digital education, corporate learning and higher education, information systems as well as from general strategy and management.",

The course takes as its starting point the key themes of personalisation; place, space and mobility; and authorship and collaboration, and uses them to guide exploration of emerging practices and technologies. We will ask: how are more established digital practices evolving? How will new digital technologies and trends impact on learning? How will the students and teachers of tomorrow construct their learning environments and practices?Of necessity, these are questions the answers to which are highly context-dependent & the future of e-learning technologies is volatile and subject to rapid change. For this reason a significant part of the course will be structured as a series of student-facilitated seminars. Each seminar will take one of the themes or issues from the initial block as a jumping off point for imagining, debating and theorising what digital futures for learning might be like.The course will draw on literature from e-learning, community education and theories of informal learning, cultural studies, geography, psychology and sociology.Students from outwith the Digital Education programme wishing to enrol for this course or take it on a 'class only' basis must liaise directly with the course secretary before enrolling.",

Students will explore what it means to be a values-led professional, and explore how issues of social justice, inclusion, diversity and sustainability are articulated in and explored through professional practices as they work towards forging their own individual identity as a transformative teacher.Collaborative practices, productive partnerships and the importance of relationships will be explored alongside critical considerations of health and well-being for the profession and for young people. Clear links are made to social justice, inclusion and child protection. The promotion of positive health and wellbeing for all serves as a foundation for inclusive practices and social justice. Emphasis is placed on the creation of a supportive, inclusive, respectful environment that values diversity and in which pupils feel safe. It explores concepts of being a teacher in order to highlight how individual teacher identity influences interpretation and enactment of health and wellbeing.This course helps build a strong foundation in student teachers' knowledge and appreciation of the wider landscape of Scottish education, whilst developing students' understanding of their professional responsibilities as a teacher in the classroom, school and in society.Students will use a problem-posing approach that will engage them in asking important questions about learning and teaching for social justice and for sustainability. It will foster and develop plurilingual learning environments in schools that enable children to explore, interrogate and critique local and global, social and environmental conditions and to become active agents in shaping and building the society and conditions that they want to live in.",

Furthermore, direct multi-sensory experiences are an ideal way of engaging with the natural heritage and the physical environment.  Awareness of the potential impact of outdoor recreational and educational activities is also important for those who work in the countryside, and increasingly an expectation of such educational programmes.  In many outdoor and environmental education contexts techniques ranging from formal field studies through to experiential environmental exercises are employed.  This course provides an understanding of the principles of ecology, and explores the application of a wide range of teaching techniques in a practical context.  The approach taken is an interdisciplinary and holistic residential programme located in a National Nature Reserve on the West Coast of Scotland.",

    "summary": "An understanding of ecosystems (in the widest sense) must be central to Learning for Sustainability. Despite humankindÂ¿s dependence on the biodiversity and bio-geochemical systems of the earth, their importance is far from a central theme in education, society and political decision-making.  This is particularly pertinent to the global and interdisciplinary nature of the Learning for Sustainability policy field.The main aim of the course is to engage participants in thinking about learning for sustainability by interrogating the influence of cultural understandings of the planet, specifically Â¿as a provider of servicesÂ¿, on their education thinking and practices. The course will examine a range of ecosystems as providers of Â¿servicesÂ¿, and in doing so it will challenge the idea that our species as being separate from the ecosphere and its processes.The course addresses three closely inter-related themes:Firstly: An understanding of the geophysical and biological processes that have shaped, and continue to shape, our living planet, and the ways in which ecosystems provide the foundations human life Â¿ fresh water, food and shelter as well as contributing to infrastructure, industry, economy, human health and well-being and poverty alleviation. The many ways in which human activity impacts on these processes will also be addressed.Secondly: A critical examination of both philosophical and educational perspectives the concept of Â¿ecosystem servicesÂ¿ and the ways in which we understand, manage and assign Â¿valueÂ¿ to ecosystems, biodiversity and their products and services, with a particular focus on how the ways in which we conceptualise and communicate about ecosystems may affect our success in creating the conditions for humans and the rest of the natural world to flourish.Thirdly: An examination of the practical implications for education, learning and teaching, including but not limited to the place of experiential education.",

By exploring the theoretical frames of peace and violence, the course then uses these different frames to explore the processes, strategies and actors within education that can have impacts, both negative and positive, on the realities of building sustainable peace. As part of the Comparative Education and International Development (CEID) pathway on the MSc in Education the course has a firm foundation in International Development.",
    "course_description": "This is an interdisciplinary course, which while focusing on the field of Education and Development draws on the parent disciplines of International Relations, Human Geography, International Development and Peace Studies. Across the duration of the course we will explore the different theoretical frames and global discourses around peacebuilding including theories of violence, positive and negative peace, liberal peace and local and hybrid peace.The strong theoretical orientation of the course will be applied to the analysis of contemporary practices of making and keeping peace and their intersection with education through the exploration of case studies that highlight the different practices, actors and challenges in the field of education and peacebuilding. This includes education in non-formal and informal forms such as community organising and youth programmes.The case studies will be structured around the substantive topics within the field, for example: gender, recognition and identity; religious and ethnic conflict; spatial movements, border-crossings and refugees. Key literature and scholars of the field will be interrogated alongside these examples to develop understanding of the contours of the main debates and inform analysis. By the end of the course, you will be able to think critically about both the potential and obstruction education can offer sustainable peace, from different approaches and theoretical frames, in light of situated conflicts in varying and complex contexts, and their intersectional issues.",

It represents a positive valuing of the diversity that characterises human experience and identity in terms of, for example, social class, gender, disability, Â¿raceÂ¿, and sexual orientation.2. The main roots of 'social exclusion' are to be found in interpersonal, structural, and systemic discrimination, frequently exerted via unexamined institutionalised practices, as well as the conscious and unconscious misuse of power, rather than in individual deficits, pathologies, dysfunctional lifestyles and prejudices;3. Discrimination of various types is socially constructed, context-specific and multi-faceted. Addressing discrimination and exclusion and moving towards a socially just education, involves change at structural, cultural and individual levels. At the individual level, practitioners need to critically examine their own practice in the context of wider political, social and economic settings.",

    "summary": "There is evidence that educators find it difficult to nurture long-standing identities of environmental citizenship with learners.  This is an important problem facing responses to issues of ecological crises/sustainability.  The problem can be analysed positively through at least two perspectives: the supposed development of identities of environmental citizenship; and the limitations on the educator in socio-cultural and institutional settings.This course will offer ideas for reflection among those who are interested in environmental, outdoor and sustainability education.  The central questions will include:Why isn't environmental citizenship just citizenship?Can education influence environmental behaviour?What places matter in education 'for' the environment?How do we consider a diverse range of learner identities and relationships in this approach to education?To assist with this reflection, we will engage in narrative enquiry and in the critical evaluation of case studies of pedagogy for environmental citizenship.",
    "course_description": "The course will address these four questions and the important links between them:1. To what extent can identities be 'environmental'?We will examine basic understandings of the concept of identity, and examine the relevance or otherwise of contact with natural environments, ecopsychology, biophilia, deep ecology, and Significant Life Experience research.2. To what extent is it possible to influence environmental behaviour through education?We will examine a range of models from environmental education and environmental campaigning that claim to represent the relationships between a learner's knowledges, beliefs, attitudes, values and behaviours.3. To what extent is it possible to be a local and/or global citizen?We will examine critical and less critical models of citizenship and environmental citizenship, as well as ways of thinking about 'local' and 'global' identities and the interaction between these.  It will also consider research into the the importance of 'place' in environmental/sustainability education.4.  To what extent does environmental / sustainability education (and education research) consider a diverse range of learner identities and relations?We will consider whether these fields are dominated by the assumption that learners are white, male, modern-Western, middle class, secular, heterosexual, and so on. In addition to considering more inter-sectional possibilities, it also looks at the significance of inter-generational learningTo reflect on the above questions, the course will engage in narrative enquiry and in the critical evaluation of case studies of pedagogies for environmental citizenship.",

    "summary": "This course focuses on the current climate crisis by exploring the ways in which education, as a form of practice, can address and mitigate environmental degradation. At the same time, the course broadens the scope of what we examine as \"education\" to incorporate variable cultural beliefs and learning practices, including local activism as well as traditional Indigenous knowledge and engagement with the natural world. It will explore a wide range of relationships between education and the environment in different localities as well as highlighting learning through and from activism. In the course, we will critically engage with several key concepts present in environmental discourse, such as the Anthropocene and the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs), as well as explore the entangled relationship between environmentalism and education. It will accomplish this by two principle means. First, we will examine environmental education in school-based contexts, with a strong focus on sustainable curriculums and eco-school designs. Second, we will engage in an in-depth understanding of Indigenous relationships to the environment in places where the impact of climate change is most notably severe, such as Amazonia, the Pacific Islands, and the Artic. Climate and eco-justice will be lens used to explore all sections of the course.  Finally, the course will examine the difficulties and challenges associated with cross-cultural communication about and around environmental issues as presented by various agents on the global stage. We offer a strong emphasize on various ways these concerns can be addressed including how to negotiate radically different perspectives, ending the course with an overview of a comprehensive understanding of the power of education for ensuring sustainable futures.",
    "course_description": "This course will explore various engagements between humans and the environment in great depth and in various contexts, with a particular focus on learning and knowledge, while critically engaging with concepts like the Anthropocene and the SDGs. Throughout all aspects of the course, we will explicitly apply the lens of climate justice to the discussion. The course will begin with a focus on school-based iterations of environmental education, and explore how this is translated into practice within the classroom, through the curriculum, and by employing innovative school design. Then the focus will shift to non-Western perspectives on human-nature relationships, with particular attention to parts of the world that have been dealing with the most severe effects of climate change, Indigenous and other marginal populations. By examining in-depth ethnographic accounts of Indigenous traditional knowledge, beliefs and practices surrounding the environment in Amazonia, the Pacific and the Artic, students will expand their understandings of formal and informal environmental education outcomes. Finally, the course will engage with the challenges accompanying the translation of cultural beliefs and characterizations of the environment on the global stage by exploring a range of climate summits and global policies. Building on these conversations, the course will explore ways in which we can successfully communicate cross-culturally in the pursuit of sustainable futures.",

Learning Log (50%): Three instalments of a reflective learning log where the student documents how the course has shifted their ideas around human-nature relationships, environmental knowledge, and how we can use education as a tool to address climate concerns. In their log entries, they will be encouraged to critically examine the material we cover throughout the course, to think of environmental education in a broad, inclusive sense, and explore the role of cultural contexts and activism in relationships with/to the environment, demonstrating cross-cultural respect and understanding. There will be a wide variety of options for the log, including written journal entries, film, animation, and/or podcast creation. The first entry will receive formative feedback and the log will be marked holistically at the end of the course.2. Developing an environmentally motivated intervention (50%): With this assessment, we invite students to think creatively about ways in which they could develop a practical intervention grounded in ecological/environmental knowledge in education. Again, they will have a range of options, including prompts and an open-ended option, to make this a creative and inclusive assessment. For example, they could write a single lesson plan integrating some knowledge from the course, illustrate how to integrate environmental awareness and best practice into curriculum or school design more broadly, or develop an idea for an activist intervention. The key aspect of this assessment would be drawing theory into practice, and thinking critically about actual steps towards addressing the environmental crisis using educational tools."

    "summary": "The history of western philosophy promotes a search for and love of wisdom. The pursuance of wisdom has never been as important as it is now, knowing that the survival of the human species requires changes to the way we live our modern lives.  The context for this search lies within a contemporary world characterised by a changing atmosphere, degraded land and seascape, reduced biodiversity, yet infinite beauty. Through Place-Based approaches to education this course will explore ways of improving the relationship between human beings and the planet we inhabit.  Â¿Inquiry as stanceÂ¿ will be explored as a method of enquiry intended to seek out the knowledge and wisdom necessary to develop action competences that promote sustainable living.  This philosophical background provides the basis from which to consider the implications for city-based outdoor learning.The planet is experiencing the largest urban growth in its history and so the way that people experience city environments is central to the quest for sustainable living.  This course focuses on being outdoors and indoors in city environments to explore how these settings might be used to provide inspiration toward sustainable living.  Key to this enquiry is the notion of Â¿presenceÂ¿ and Â¿phenomenologyÂ¿ which suggest that the way in which people experience the places they inhabit influences their values.  Thus, the idea of Â¿presenceÂ¿ becomes central to the issue of our everyday personal and social identity that has wider moral implications for the way we relate to the planet.The course is rooted in the tradition of Place-Based Education and seeks to explore the relationship between indoor and outdoor learning, motivation and pro-environmental behaviour.  It specifically takes note of the proclamation from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO, 2019:1) that Â¿all levels and forms of existing educational and teaching and learning programmes need to be reviewed and re-oriented to address the causes and consequences of climate change (and biodiversity loss)Â¿.  Using this proclamation as a Â¿sounding boardÂ¿ this course will explore city-based outdoor learning and the opportunities available in the development of programmes intended to address the transition towards sustainable living.",

The course also enables students to reflect on their learning from the other courses within the programme which should by then include at least four courses from the deaf education pathway. There is no attendance required at University for the Placement course, however there are mandatory online resources for students. It will involve three weeks of teaching placement in the new educational setting . There will be a minimum of one observational visits by a University tutor. The Qualified Teacher of Deaf Children (QToD) also provides two formative observation reports. Assessment for the course is composed of these three observation reports, and three tasks where the student reflects on the relationship between theory, research and practice.",

Students will show in their teaching file on the external placement how they have systematically gathered data about deaf children, understood what language learning needs the child has (in spoken English and/or British Sign Language as relevant), and investigated the children's audiological needs and listening environment. Students should show in their plans for teaching how they use previous assessments and IEPs or similar to inform lesson plans and sequences. The student will liaise with a wide range of other professionals who interact with the service for deaf children such as speech and language therapist, third sector organisations, audiology clinic, mainstream colleagues and parents to demonstrate professional and positive relationships. The teaching on the external placement will demonstrate respectful listening to deaf children's views, and collecting their feedback. The student should have the opportunity on external placement to observe more experienced colleagues in areas of work they have not previously had the opportunity to work with in their usual work setting.

Indeed, the External Examiner has given us a very strong steer in this direction.  By drawing on the scholarly literature, including both qualitative and quantitative research, reflective accounts of practice and other diverse forms of enquiry, it will provide colleagues with some foundations that could be used as the basis for their further development of, and learning about, their academic practice. The course will address theory and practice in promoting active learning and student engagement in higher education, with a view to enabling our participants to work constructively with diverse groups of students and with varying capabilities.  It will look at the importance of learning journeys and student diversity in designing and teaching in range of learning environments, as well as at questions about learning design and delivery, including the use of technology.  It will also look at the development of a research portfolio and an important theme is to support participants with career planning and to give them the tools they need to develop their academic practice, including both leadership and pedagogic practice, over a number of years.   It will emphasise the use of digital technology as a core element of teaching practice by adopting a blended approach to the delivery of this course.",
    "course_description": "FAP will provide an opportunity for colleagues from across the University to develop a critical understanding of core aspects of their academic practice including teaching, assessment and feedback, management, research and external engagement.There are three rationales for the course.  First, the course will meet the need for professional development of colleagues as accredited by the Higher Education Academy, and as set out in the UK Professional Standards Framework (PSF).  The emphasis of this Framework, and of this proposed course, is on supporting colleagues to enhance their scholarly understanding of learning and teaching.  The proposed course is designed to build on our colleaguesÂ¿ own practice and to encourage them to reflect on this in a critical manner with a view to improving on it.Secondly, the course will enable colleagues to contribute to designing and delivering the high quality learning environments and learning experiences set out in the UniversityÂ¿s Learning and teaching Enhancement Strategy.  The chief aims are:Â¿\tto strengthen and enhance the quality of students' experiences of university study wherever necessary, appropriate and practicableÂ¿\tto sustain an environment in which excellence in learning and teaching can thrive and where refinements and innovations in practices are prized and promulgatedÂ¿\tto encourage everyone involved in teaching and supporting learning to play their part in enhancing as well as ensuring qualityThe remit of this course is to prepare colleagues to deliver this vision through critically reflecting on, and developing, their own academic practice within the University.Thirdly, it provides the opportunity to support colleagues in the development of their research careers, and in this way to make an active contribution to the research strategies of their Schools.This course will provide our colleagues with an opportunity to engage with, and critically examine, different pedagogies and practices with a view to enhancing their academic practice. Furthermore, participants are encouraged to experiment and discuss with peers in order to widen their understanding and share practice between different disciplines and Schools, as well as to build on the wealth of expertise they bring with them.",

Students will be encouraged to consider the relationship between social divisions, life experiences and academic achievement and to challenge formalised, hierarchical and rigid approaches to children's learning.This course prompts students to reflect on the vision of social and political change at the heart of Froebelian philosophy. Unlike in Froebel's times, early learning and care have moved to the forefront of political agendas on a national and global level, and their significance for early intervention and addressing social inequalities are increasingly recognized.  The course will ask participants to identify and consider how to develop strategies that address key legal and policy requirements, obligations and entitlements relating to challenging discriminatory practice.  This will include a critical analysis of strategies such as 'teaching for diversity' and 'teaching for equity'.It will equip students to develop their skills for disruptive and innovative practice and policy management, and to increase all children's visibility and rights.  It advances Froebelian principles by bringing his thinking into conversation with contemporary social justice theories such as critical race theory (CRT), recognition, redistribution and representation theories, inclusion and intersectionality.

They will be supported in challenging different ideas about intelligence and will critique national approaches to gifted and Talented Youth in the face of calls for social justice and equity.Beliefs about the very nature of intelligence lie at the heart of educational experiences. Increasingly, concern for the identification and provision of gifted and talented youth is leading to a strong interest in the ways in which we conceptualise intelligence/ability and the implications for teaching and learning (eg English reform and provision / Scottish Network for Able Pupils Â¿ University of Glasgow / World Congress for Gifted and Talented Youth 2009).  This course aims to problematise intelligence concepts while also developing a critical consideration of issues surrounding identification and provision in different contexts/countries. The course will afford students an opportunity to interrogate the nature of intelligence within their own professional fields, and to conceptualise, design and plan a possible policy and intervention for their own contexts.",

Children are no longer seen as simply passive recipients of services and care but as active participants in their own lives and the lives of others. This change is underpinned by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is the most ratified  human rights convention in the world.

    "summary": "Rationale and AimsEnglish is now a globalised phenomenon and English is now used by diverse speakers from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds around the globe. As a global language, English now functions as an international lingua franca and language teachers need to develop an awareness of this new role that English plays today. However, in English Language Teaching (ELT), the native English speaker continues to dominate. Literature published in the last few decades documents the increasing number of non-native English speakers and also the need for a revaluation of ELT practice. In addition, both the field of World Englishes, which focuses on the identification and codification of national varieties of English, and the field of English as a Lingua Franca (ELF), which focuses on the use of ELF between speakers from different lingua-cultural backgrounds, have taken on growing importance, and in recent years the pedagogic implications have been increasingly stressed.The main objective of this course is to explore the theoretical, descriptive and applied interest in the spread of English. It revisits many of the concepts and theories covered in the core courses in semester one including curriculum, methodology, language testing and policy in light of the globalisation of English. This course explores research within the World Englishes and ELF research paradigms, as well as looking at research studies on attitudes towards English and English teachers, where students are encouraged to examine research studies in this field critically. The main focus is in the applied interest of the spread of English, looking at the pedagogical implications for ELT. The dominance of native English speaker norms is explored in various contexts, as well as the recent proposals suggested for change to ELT. The course examines approaches to curriculum reform and also the possible barriers to implementing change in varied teaching contexts.This course is intended for students interested in the pedagogical implications of the globalization of English. Pedagogy is a growing concern among those interested in the field of Global Englishes, yet this remains largely at the theoretical level. Little research has been done and the resources for teachers interested in incorporating a Global Englishes perspective into their classrooms continue to be scarce. This course aims to address the theory/practice divide, critically examine the research the available research, and help future teachers examine the ELT materials available to them and consider ways to incorporate a Global Englishes perspective into their classrooms to meet the needs of students who are likely to use the language as a global lingua franca.",
    "course_description": "Course ContentWeek One:  The history of English and the global spread of EnglishWeek Two:  English in the Inner and Outer circles and World Englishes researchWeek Three: English in global contexts and multi-diverse English as a Lingua FrancaWeek Four: Decolonisation of English to confront Linguistic Imperialism, Neo-colonisation, and RecolonisationWeek Five: English Language TeachingWeek Six: Global Englishes Language TeachingWeek Seven: The Future of EnglishWeek Eight: PresentationsCourse Format8 x 1hr lecture; 8 x 2hr workshopNumber of credits: 20Level: Postgraduate (level 11)The workshops will be designed around the readings and topics introduced in lectures. Each lecture is accompanied by several types of tasks for use in the workshop. There are a number of introductory activities and discussion activities that support the readings. These will be done within Learning Sets both prior and during each workshop.Introductory activities.This includes activities that will introduce the topic of the lecture, but will not require specialized knowledge on the topic.  That is, students will be able to engage in these activities as pre-reading exercises before coming to the workshop.  This task contains the following activity types:-       Opening discussion activity using a verbal and/or non-verbal prompt-\tA ranking or survey based activity to elicit beliefs from the students-\tA case study-      A research task and/or lesson planReading and discussion.This task includes the weekly reading. Each week, students will be assigned a chapter/article to read and discuss with their Learning Sets. In addition, each student in a Learning Set is required to read a different chapter/article and complete a reading worksheet, summarise the content to their classmates and lead a discussion on the issues raised using prepared questions. There is a long list of readings to choose from, so students can choose something relevant to their own context or interests.Listening and discussion.This task uses audio and visual materials that complement issues raised in the lecture. Students listen to and/or watch the material and discuss the content. The various formats of the listening materials, which include interviews, focus groups, observations and the like, provide a basis for research students to practice fundamental skills of research data analysis. These activities are also designed to support the studentsÂ¿ research for their dissertation. The materials have the following features: A wide range of text types and media, such verbal and non-verbal texts, comprising a wide variety of Englishes.Debating the issues.This task will showcase a main debate of an issue of central importance to the topic of the lecture using the content of the lecture as a springboard for conversation.  The course takes a balanced view of Global Englishes and students are encouraged to debate the contents in relation to their own specific teaching contexts.Materials evaluation and design.This task will enable students to critically evaluate ELT materials in relation to Global Englishes Research. Students will also have the opportunity to design materials and lesson plans to introduce students in their chosen context to Global Englishes-related topics.Research evaluation and design.This task is also designed to support the studentsÂ¿ dissertation projects. Students will critically examine various research studies and also design their own studies in Learning Sets.",

The course is designed to introduce students to key actors shaping global discourse and highlight the interaction between global and local forces in creating and adapting context specific education policy.In this course we will examine questions such as: What is global governance and global education policy? Who are the main actors and institutions involved in the creation and diffusion of global education policy? What are some of the main mechanisms used in the dissemination of global education policy? How have the dominant perspectives and approaches been challenged by emerging global actors? What are some of the critiques and controversies related to global education policies? How are global education policies developed, circulated, and locally applied? How are they contested and localized?In particular, we will analyse the mechanisms, educational policies and strategies from UNESCO, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the World Bank. We will examine how the global community came to an agreement on the global goals for education (Sustainable Development Goal 4) as well as whether the creation of such goals and emerging actors represent a challenge to the dominant institutions shaping global education policy. The course will include a combination of individual and group work permitting students to practice their analytic, collaborative, and negotiation skills as they sharpen their critical thinking in the comparative education and international development field.",

Feedback will involve formative assessment. Tutor visit is required to allow progression to assignment.Part 2 Course participants will complete a case study demonstrating their role and responsibility as a specialist teacher of the visually impaired for an individual or group of visually impaired pupils that they are currently supporting within the context of inclusion using relevant recent research and the theoretical perspectives addressed in this course. (4000 words) 20 credits.Students on the Postgraduate Diploma Inclusive Education (visually impaired learners) who receive a mark of less than 50%, in any of the components of the assessment,  have one opportunity to resit. They will receive a tutorial from the course tutor to discuss the resit, then usually a period of 4 weeks will be agreed for resubmission. If the student fails the resit, they will exit with a Postgraduate Certificate or transcript.The mark which will appear on Euclid, the official space where marks are announced on MyEd will reflect the first mark. This mark is used to provide an average for the whole diploma. However, the resit mark will not be capped at 50% and it will also appear on the mark sheet put to the Inclusive Education examination board.To read more about this exam regulation, please go to:  http://bit.ly/2mJyIySThe School Postgraduate Studies Committee at the School of Education agreed  during 2015/16 that this regulation would come into force from 16/17. The Scottish Association of Visual Impairment Education (SAVIE) argued that the mandatory nature of the qualification meant that it was essential that teachers of visually impaired children attain this minimum level for all specialist courses.  The committee agreed that only one resit would be possible.  Regulation 27.1 from the link above explains this."

Particular attention will be given to identifying how to critically engage with evidence of practice in ways that reveal how practice might inadvertently (as well as intentionally) stigmatise or marginalise diverse groups of young people. This will reflect national and international commitments to the education of all children and young people together, within communities.This knowledge and understanding will provide the context for exploration of relevant practical and political pedagogical realities such as: the phenomena of the widening attainment gap; the correlation between poverty and underachievement; how schools identify and support children recognised as having additional support needs; the need for specialist expertise, and how to access it. Attention will be paid to curriculum and assessment, as well as functional and strategic methods for inclusive pedagogy.Students on the course who are also practitioners will be given the opportunity to reflect on their own practice, as well as consider that of others. Full time students will be provided with the opportunity to study practice in schools, as well as re-consider practice they may be familiar with in other contexts.Two study groups will run alongside each other in semester one.

    "summary": "This course aims to enable students to develop a critical understanding of the discourses of identities and interculturality in the 21st century. Taking into account cultural, social, political and economic conditions, we focus on how different identities are classified, constructed, negotiated, and performed in intercultural contexts across time and space. Particular attention will be paid to theoretical perspectives of intercultural language learner identities, methodological approaches and analytical frameworks. Students will be able to analyse how intercultural language learner identity is conceptualised in language education and related fields. StudentsÂ¿ identities (e.g., as learners and language educators) and experience in second language learning and teaching will be discussed through workshop activities. The course will investigate how language educators can facilitate creative collaboration to perform their identities within communities and support their role as full members of society. This requires a critical examination of the connections of language competencies to pedagogical practices, especially symbolic competence. Pedagogically, the discourses on intercultural language learner identities and competencies provide innovative educational and dialogic practices that draw on arts-based, technology, and social media approaches. Students will examine how these three approaches reconstruct learning environments into inclusive spaces that recognise various languages, cultures, identities and forms of representation.",
    "course_description": "Block 1:This block outlines the theoretical foundations of intercultural language learner identity within various interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary approaches. The modern, postmodern and critical perspectives on the conceptualisation of intercultural learner identities will be examined for points of intersection and difference. Students will critically examine the link between theory, methodology, and methods when analysing the intersectionality between identity and interculturality by reflecting on different data types. Ethical dilemmas and challenges are addressed in relation to interculturality and language identities research, particularly issues such as global intercultural identities, inclusive language policy, civic responsibility, and social justice. Learners will critique their influence as researchers in constructing representations of interculturality in their research or classroom discourse.Block 2:This second block discusses how intercultural language learner identity is a key construct in different second language learning contexts. The course introduces the development of research on identity in language education. Students will examine the key constructs that arise in current discussions of identity before considering seven perspectives on identity, which, to varying degrees, have been present in theories and research on identity: race, ethnicity, nationality, migration, gender, social class, and language. Students study language and humanmobility and complexity in the age of globalisation, which has proposed certain forms of competencies: Â¿intercultural communicative competenceÂ¿, global citizenship, Â¿multidialectal competenceÂ¿, and Â¿symbolic competence.Â¿ Students will also evaluate their role as educators of language and intercultural and multilingual communication confronting increasingly complex challenges at the local-global fronts, resulting from border control, forced migration and displacement, war, diseases, policies, and other forces that influence access to education, employment, security, and sustainability.Block 3:This block focuses on innovative approaches to intercultural language learner identity in the new era. Firstly, the study of intercultural language identities drawing on critical intercultural education and approaches and methods is explored, such as arts-based methods and performative pedagogy. Critical intercultural education is connected to professional practice and the use of art-based methods (e.g., filming, symbols and collage) to understand self-other identity. Secondly, intercultural language learner identity and the possibilities of social media is introduced. Finally, the notions of Â¿cultureÂ¿ and Â¿interculturalityÂ¿ in the context of postmodernism and the nature of digital interactions are discussed. Students will explore how technology and online learning construct cultural experiences and digital selves",

There is no attendance required at University for the Placement course, however there are mandatory online resources for students. It will involve four weeks of teaching placement in the teacher's own workplace . There will be a minimum of one observational visits by a University tutor. The Qualified Teacher of Deaf Children (QToD) also provides two formative observation reports. Assessment for the course is composed of these three observation reports, and four tasks where the student reflects on the relationship between theory, research and practice.",

We expect students to be able to explore the differing viewpoints through their tasks and through professional discussions with their QToD mentor and university visiting tutor.  Students will show in their teaching file on the internal placement how they have systematically gathered data about deaf children, understood what language learning needs the child has (in spoken English and/or British Sign Language as relevant), and investigated the children's audiological needs and listening environment. Students should show in their plans for teaching how they use previous assessments and IEPs or similar to inform lesson plans and sequences. The student will liaise with a wide range of other professionals who interact with the service for deaf children such as speech and language therapist, third sector organisations, audiology clinic, mainstream colleagues and parents to demonstrate professional and positive relationships. The teaching on the internal placement will demonstrate respectful listening to deaf children's views, and collecting their feedback. The student should have the opportunity on internal placement to observe more experienced colleagues in areas of work they have not previously seen, such as working with families with deaf children aged 0 - 5. Students will be expected to read key readings related to their placement and find other academic readings related to issues they explore in the assessed Tasks.",

The formative influences, geological, geomorphological, biological, human (historical and contemporary), will be considered chronologically.  In historical times the changes that have occurred in landscape character, in land ownership and in the growing demands for public use and environmental protection have been determined, shaped and constrained by local, national and international legislation.  These issues will be given specific attention in relation to their influence on the landscape of the present day.The structure of the landscape and its development and the way in which the relationship between the public and the countryside is affected by legislation will be considered as both technical issues and also for their educational potential.  Whilst the landscape of the UK will necessarily offer the main teaching examples the landscapes of other countries will be included where appropriate.

In mapping the changes in comparative education as a field, the course will highlight theoretical and epistemic shifts over time and the changes in thought. it build on global authors and approaches, it will offer a variety of perspectives from different traditions in knowledge and practice.2)\tOutline Content: The course presents materials over 10 weeks. The syllabus is divided into two parts that allow students to critically explore the main theories, concepts and challenges of the field of Comparative Education. Part I takes a historical journey that profiles comparisons in education from early antiquity to contemporary globalisation (Learning Outcomes 1 and 2). Part II introduces the current debates in the field and the critiques to the nature of knowledge production in Comparative Education. With a focus on Learning Outcomes 3, 4, and 5, Part II first emphasises selected key issues such as the role of context, the challenges of policy borrowing, gender and the role of international metrics in shaping education. Second, it offers poignant critiques from marginalised scholars and theories (e.g., feminist, indigenous, post-colonial, Southern).3)\tStudent Learning Experience: This Course will be one of the main pillars of the MSc in CEID. It will enable students to understand comparative education's purposes, relevance, and key challenges today. The historical and critical approaches aim to offer students the tools to construct their knowledge with criticality and autonomy. In addition, students will benefit from the background of the teaching staff who are researchers actively engaged with the field of Comparative Education.",

Students will have opportunities to explore case studies that highlight different practices, actors, and challenges in the field of education and development. This includes gender equality, environmental issues, peacebuilding and language of instruction, and their interaction with education and development.Key literature and scholars of the field will be interrogated to develop an understanding of the contours of the main debates and inform the analysis. By the end of the course, students will be able to think critically about the challenges posed to and the potential of education to assist in international development from different approaches and theoretical frames, in light of different contexts and practices.",

Institutions and Educators.This section asks to what extent institutions of education (from schools to national education policies to global non-governmental organisations) can promote or hinder teachers or educators or facilitators of LfS, within dominant professional, economic, political and institutional cultures.4. Learning AS Sustainability.This section considers the purposes and possible practices of LfS in contexts of complexity, radical doubt, the 'risk society', controversy and irreducible uncertainty.  It considers various models and practices sometimes referred to a 'learning as sustainability', 'the evolutionary model' or 'post-normal environmental/sustainability education'.5. LfS for knowledges and literaciesThis section considers theory and practice in relation to the knowledges and literacies that might result from LfS. It will include emphases on cross-disciplinarity, creativity, embodiment and affect.6. LfS for participationThis section considers theory in practice in relation to the capabilities and competencies that might result from LfS. It will include emphases on action competence, political literacies and participation.7.

    "course_description": "Course DeliveryThis course will be taught through lectures (8 hours) and workshops (16 hours):The Lectures will inform the students about:- up-to-date information on research on language description which is relevant to second language instruction (e.g., in weeks 3 and 4 the findings of corpus research on formulaic language and spoken grammar will be relayed to the students);- the different ways in which elements of language are presented to  L2 learners  (e.g., the way in which many spoken dialogues are stripped of all pragmatic and discourse elements in some learning contexts but not in others);- metalinguistic terms which will enable them to describe elements of language with precision.In the Workshops the learners will:- review their understanding of key points from the lectures.- carry out a variety of tasks which require: critical reflection on their own language as well as their own experiences of teaching and/or learning a second language in relation to the areas of language under focus; critical analysis of empirical research that has focused on the presentation of language in textbooks or the teaching of an area of language or testing of an area of language; short presentations based on critical analysis of language use by second language learners; critical evaluation of teaching materials focusing on the area of language under focus.The course also involves pre-workshop groups in which students meet in designated groups (without their class tutor) to go over tasks in preparation for the workshop. These pre-workshops will typically last for between one and two hours.Indicative ContentWeek 1   Course Overview + The Language ContinuumThe focus will be on the range of elements which constitute language from micro elements (e.g., phonemes and lexemes) to macro elements (e.g., discourse-level phenomena and the interaction between language and culture).Week 2:  Pronunciation:  Segmentals and Supra-segmentalsThe focus will be on developing studentsÂ¿ awareness of the importance of covering both segmentals and supra-segmentals in second language instruction. Particular focus will be given to the role of understanding supra-segmentals (elision, linking, assimilation, etc.) in developing effective listening skills.Week 3\tGrammar:  Form, Meaning and UseThe focus will be on the importance of language instruction covering all aspects of grammatical elements: form (syntax); meaning (semantics) and function (pragmatics and discourse).Week 4   Lexis:  From Lexemes to Formulaic LanguageThe focus will be on developing studentsÂ¿ awareness of the role of formulaic language in learnersÂ¿ vocabularies. Focus will also be given to the view that lexis and grammar form a continuum as opposed to clearly defined categories of language. Findings from corpus analysis and research on construction grammar will be presented to students.Week 5   Grammar and Lexis:  Written Language vs. Spoken LanguageThe focus will be on developing studentsÂ¿ awareness of the differences between spoken and written grammar and vocabulary which have mainly been discovered through analysis of large corpora over the past few decades.Week 6   Pragmatics:  Pragmatic Competence vs. Grammatical CompetenceThe focus will be on developing studentsÂ¿ awareness of the importance of pragmatic competence in effective communication. The issue of whether pragmatic competence can be taught will be covered as well as research which has compared the relative importance of pragmatic and grammatical competence in successful communication.Week 7\tDiscourse:  Genres and RegistersThe focus will be on developing studentsÂ¿ awareness of features of language at the discourse level. Focus will be given to both spoken discourse (IRF sequences; overlapping; interrupting, etc.) and written discourse (cohesion, coherence and contrastive rhetoric,etc.).Week 8:   Language and Culture - World Englishes; English as a Lingua FrancaThe focus will be on the issues of: what version(s) of English should be taught to learners?; the development of world Englishes (e.g., Singlish); and intercultural communication.",

After considering the theoretical foundations of intercultural citizenship education where the assumed connection between belonging and the nation-state is questioned, the course will focus on the political dimension of language learning and teaching. In so doing, it will introduce students to the purposes of modern/foreign language education in order to distinguish between the notions of linguistic and intercultural competence, before examining the ways in which intercultural citizenship education may be planned, taught and assessed. This will be followed by a discussion of the notions of traditional and organic intellectual which will encourage students to reflect on the roles of language teachers.",
    "course_description": "Indicative ContentBlock 1 (weeks 1-2): Theorisations of Intercultural Citizenship EducationThis first block discusses the theoretical foundations of intercultural citizenship education within the context of solidarity and difference. To do so, it first questions the assumed connection between belonging and the nation-state, before introducing students to shared global problems that open up spaces for political and ethical engagement. This is followed by a review of current education and language education policies which provide students with a conceptual framework on which to base discussions within the course.Block 2 (weeks 3-4): Purposes of Intercultural Citizenship EducationThis second block discusses the purposes of intercultural citizenship education within the context of second language learning. To do so, it explores the notions of linguistic and intercultural competence by arguing that language teaching has perhaps clung too long to the first notion at the expense of the second. Students will be asked to consider the kinds of questions that arise from this argument through discussion of the implications they may have for pedagogic practice.Block 3 (weeks 5-7): Teaching and Assessing Intercultural CitizenshipThis third block discusses the ways in which intercultural citizenship can be taught and assessed by second language teachers. To do so, it introduces students to the concept of 'politische bildung' in order to present theoretical frameworks that combine the teaching of intercultural competence with the political dimension of language learning and teaching. This is followed by a review of existing approaches to assessment which students will be asked to discuss in relation to the inherent complexity of intercultural competences.Block 4 (week 8): Intercultural Citizenship Education and the Organic IntellectualAfter bringing together the topics discussed in the course, this fourth block encourages students to reflect on the roles of language teachers. To do so, it distinguishes between the traditional and the organic intellectual in order to show how organic intellectuals can elaborate new currents of ideas within the context of language education for intercultural citizenship.",

    "summary": "This course aims to enable students to develop a critical understanding of language and intercultural communication pedagogy, and locate this within a range of educational contexts that are likely to sustain intercultural dialogue in the increasingly globalised world in which we now live. In so doing, the course discusses competing conceptualisations of culture and intercultural communication, functional classroom methodologies, and political approaches to the study of language and culture that are dedicated to establishing the connections between intercultural citizenship education and conflict resolution. In keeping with this approach, students will be encouraged to develop a rigorous, ethical stance towards pedagogic practice, and examine their roles as reflective practitioners who mediate between the language classroom and international civil society. As part of the strategy to enable students to become competent reflective practitioners, course tutors will provide examples of good practice, referring to such issues as cultural distance and proximity, cross-cultural understanding, and intercultural communicative competence.",
    "course_description": "This course critically examines the nexus of Language and Intercultural Communication within the context of education. Students on this course will critically reflect upon the importance of Language and Intercultural Communication for education and the importance of education on Language and Intercultural Communication. Language and Intercultural Communication are problematised from a dialogical and critical approach which aims to enrich students through focusing on the self-other relationship in interaction. The course problematises in-part macro forces and influences (e.g., globalisation) in how language and intercultural communication are both shaped in education, explicitly though, in decontextualising intercultural competencies, micro-level interaction comes under the microscope in this course (e.g., the role of language and intercultural communication in everyday discourses, in representations, in the role of power, in the engendering of identities, in the role of the teacher, in educational contexts, etc.). This course demands that students conceptually think: If intercultural competencies can be taught in education, then for whom? By whom? And, for what purpose?",

Drawing mainly on sociolinguistics and socio-political approaches, it introduces students to various views on how language, education and society interact. Course students will explore the concepts of language, power, identity and ideology in language education, both at the micro-level (e.g. classroom talk, teachers' attitudes) and macro-level (e.g. language in education policy and planning) of the field of language education. Discussions in this course are grounded in the recognition of our global and multilingual world, and will address current related issues, such as the hybridity of language practices in our superdiverse schools. Students will also consider the best quantitative and qualitative approaches to investigate issues related to language, education and society.",

Combining theoretical work with practical activities, students will examine how the flow of data and proliferation of digital resources actively shape learning spaces, for instance through personalisation, mobility, commercialisation and the de-centring of the physical classroom and campus.",
    "course_description": "As digital technologies have become an everyday feature of our educational surroundings, it is vital to consider how these resources shape the classroom and campus, as well as other kinds of learning spaces. A 'learning space' refers here to any setting where teaching, writing, reading or other educational activity is performed. Meanwhile, 'technology' is understood as hardware, software, digital infrastructure and the flow of data. This course will draw on the growing body of critical research around space and technology to critically evaluate how the procurement, deployment and configuration of digital technologies affects a range of learning spaces. Students will work with theories of space and technology, and will generate and analyse data, in order to evaluate and understand the complex relationship between digital resources and educational environments. This will include interrogating how space and technology are woven together with pedagogy, policy, profit and other constraints and pressures.",

Students consider the notion of problem identification as well as problem solving and ethical decision making through real-world problems and examples of curricula.Through the course students explore the development of subject specific knowledge required to enable them to understand progression and conceptual development; appropriate enquiry and assessment practices that inform curriculum design, planning for teaching that will progress learning. Students will analyse and critique research-informed theory in each disciplinary area, drawing on subject-based and wider educational perspectives.Students will explore key theories and concepts underpinning various curricular designs; considering the intent and values-base of different models; eg. curriculum as prescription, as experience, learner-centred, society-centred, knowledge-centred. This will include critically analysing conceptual knowledge in disciplines such as expressive arts, social studies, and religious and moral education. This approach recognises that children's capacity to communicate their thoughts, values and beliefs critically and creatively and using different modes of expression is foundational for learning and teaching.The course will facilitate development of the pedagogical content knowledge (Shulman, 1986) necessary for effective teaching and progression of student learning. This includes understanding of languages and literacies learning and teaching in primary schools, to ensure children become language users in a diverse world. Students will explore core STEAM concepts in the primary years. This will include in-depth exploration of learners' paths of progression, common misconceptions and powerful ways of representing core concepts to support learning. There will also be support for student teachers in auditing their own numeracy knowledge in order to identify and address any gaps in the knowledge they will need to underpin effective teaching of STEAM topics.Focussing on approaches to development of children's foundational understanding in each discipline will be complemented by an interdisciplinary focus that will facilitate critical reflection on common concerns. This will include research-informed consideration of methods for primary STEAM, literacies, social subjects, expressive arts and physical education, such as teaching through various interdisciplinary approaches, problem solving and enquiry, expressive arts pedagogies, outdoor learning and use of digital technologies and digital pedagogies.",

This course aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of the intersection between digital technology and online language learning and teaching. It is designed to equip you with the necessary tools, theoretical frameworks, and practical strategies to leverage technology effectively in language teaching, to critically assess existing affordances and challenges, and to develop your own online language course.",
    "course_description": "This course will give you the opportunity to explore and critique existing technologies that can support, facilitate, and enhance language learning and teaching. You will be tasked to engage with a range of state-of-the-art tools, applications, and digital technologies and evaluate their potential for language education. We will explore how technology can be used effectively for developing different language skills and communication, in what ways it can inform, facilitate, and enhance language assessments, and what material-design principles should be adopted when designing online language courses. Importantly, you will develop the skills to critically evaluate existing technologies and get the chance to try out existing evidence-based practices.The assessment will allow you to apply the above knowledge and skills through providing you the opportunity to design, (part-)build, and evaluate your own online language learning course. To aid you with this, the lectures and workshops will focus on (specific topics covered in the lectures may change):-\tCurrent research on educational technology in language learning/teaching-\tData-driven language learning-\tCorpora in language classrooms-\tThe potential of AI for language learning-\tVirtual and extended reality for language learning-\tMOOCS and other online language learning opportunities-\tLanguage assessment and technology",

    "summary": "The concept of environmental education is undergoing change.  Within public and policy discourse the term Learning for Sustainability (LfS) is gaining credence both nationally and internationally.  Environmental education has traditionally been about the green environment with an implicit hope that learners will develop the skills and attitudes to enable them to make informed decisions about environmental issues.LfS contains all of the content of environmental education but starts from the aim of people altering their behaviour to achieve sustainable living,  e.g. living in a way that does not deplete non-renewable resources which will be needed by future generations.  It acknowledges that people are the problem and the solution to most environmental problems and recognises that economic, political, social and cultural behaviour are significant elements in understanding sustainable living.These developing ideas create exciting opportunities for outdoor educationalists.  Because outdoor education depends to a large extent on direct experience of different environments, and multi-sensory approaches to learning, there are specific opportunities to engage in LfS that is residentially based because many such outcomes are not readily available through class-based education.  However, research suggests that outdoor educators tend to define environmental education very narrowly focussing on, for example, avoiding trampling over rare plants, not disturbing birds, taking care to limit erosion at abseil sites, creating wildlife habitats and instructing pupils that litter can be harmful to wildlife. These differing definitions provide a starting point from which this course will explore the role of outdoor education in relation to values and attitudes.  This will be done by looking at theoretical positions which transcend the belief that environmental education is simply about the 'green' environment.  A central theme of the course is the relationship between human beings and the non-human world.",

This course is a 36 hour course and taught alongside the PGDE Secondary Curriculum and Pedagogy Course. The extra time is an acknowledgement of an extra component - such as a second language. Thus, the learning and teaching and the learning outcomes are the same as for PGDE Secondary Curriculum and Pedagogy (EDUA11289). The students on this course are organised in subject discipline strands within this course and undertake most of their learning within these groups, although there are opportunities for interdisciplinary learning built into the schedule. The Learning Outcomes are generic for the course and are met within the subject discipline strands. The assessment for the course is a generic non-subject specific assessment undertaken by students on this course.This course is informed by a core lecture programme. Concepts introduced within the lecture programme are developed further within discipline specific  tutorial groups. A range of pedagogical approaches are employed within the tutorial groups including: direct teaching; individual tutorials; task based collaborative group work; learning in the outdoors; student presentations and student led teaching; micro teaching and whole group and small group discussion.The core aim of this course is to prepares student teachers for placement and professional practice, therefore it engages students in subject teaching in the Scottish secondary school from S1 to S6. This course is structured to encourage all students to explore core contemporary themes through the lecture programme series and to critically and analytically engage with theories of teaching, learning and assessment. Students are expected to apply these theories to practice and critically reflect on the outcomes. In particular and building on that broad academic and theoretically applied basis, the course is designed to provoke students to critically consider their teaching practice as a way to reflect upon their own professional identity and values as a teacher in Scotland today.Like all Level 11 courses within the School of Education, students are expected to engage extensively with, and make meaningful and purposeful use of a range of literature for both their subject disciplines., some of which they will source for themselves.",

This course explores and reflects on the dominant conceptions of education, educational research, professionalism and pedagogic practices as they are currently constructed, both nationally and globally.  Student teachers will draw on their critically informed understanding of these concepts to engage in a systematic small-scale classroom-based study that embeds the principles of sustainability, social justice, linguistic and cultural diversity and inclusion to inform and refine their own pedagogic practices.",
    "course_description": "Course content is designed to engage and familiarise student teachers with their role as a critical and analytical agent of change, committed to improvement and development in education, as well as becoming an effective, reflexive practitioner, as they work towards forging their own individual identity as a transformative teacher.This SCQF level 11 course helps student teachers to engage in new ways of thinking and engaging in practice as they develop the knowledge, skills and dispositions needed for 21st century classrooms. To ensure the core commitments of the PGDE programmes are implemented, this course enables student teachers to draw on principles of sustainability, social justice, linguistic and cultural diversity and inclusion to critique, analyse and reflect on the wider landscape of Scottish education, and the changing nature of a more global educational context. The course also develops studentsÂ¿ understanding of their professional remit and responsibilities as a teacher in the classroom, in the school and in society. This preparation is firmly in accordance with the GTCS Standard for Provisional Registration and takes full account of the Donaldson Review of Teacher Education (2010).Students work and learn in multi-disciplinary groups, exploring the implications and expectations of educational theory being employed effectively in practice. As the key part of this process, students are required to read and respond critically and analytically to research based literature, educational policy and government legislation relating to a wide range of salient issues, themes and topics, including, but not limited to: theories in teaching, learning and assessment; the nature, structure and values of the Scottish Curriculum; Social Justice and Inclusion; linguistic and cultural diversity; Learning for Sustainability; and Digital Literacies.In a commitment to life long professional learning and integrity, student teachers are introduced to the concept of reflective and reflexive practices, and begin to chart their own development in this area through an online reflective journal.The Professional Studies course helps build a strong foundation in student teachersÂ¿ knowledge and appreciation of the value and importance of teacher research, adopting a disposition towards inquiry as stance as an approach to informing and supporting their professional development, through an evidence based, solution focused approach to improving practice.In sum, this course teaches, guides and encourages student teachers to engage in: reflective and reflexive practice; group based investigative projects and presentations; critical engagement with academic literature and professional documentation; and small-scale teacher inquiry projects. The overarching aim is to improve and develop studentsÂ¿, professional skills, dispositions, knowledge and understanding, based on professional values, in order to enable them to become an informed and effective classroom practitioner, as well as an agent of educational change committed to continuous improvement.",

    "course_description": "The course runs in Semester 1 and develops students' advanced understanding of the educational philosophy and practice of Friedrich Froebel. Froebel's work has been adopted and carried forward in many early years settings and primary schools today.  However, the source of the practice is not often proclaimed as Froebelian.  In other words, much of current early years practice has re-created versions of Froebel's principles.  This course will revisit the origins of the kindergarten, offer further explorations of Froebelian principles and enable innovative practical implementation, critically linked to current research, policy and theory in Childhood Practice, and in comparison to Scottish, European and international approaches and policies. This involves analysing the complex relationship between ideas that underpin the way educational professionals work with children and families, everyday practices and contemporary ideas concerning pedagogy, curriculum and assessment.Students will be asked to locate themselves reflectively in their current and future practice, pose questions about their strengths (e.g. in relation to Froebelian principles), and consider the challenges of implementing Froebelian practice in a contemporary world. This requires students to take leadership roles, to work in integrated ways, and analyse the contexts of children's learning.  Course participants will be asked to consider the historical context of Froebel's ideas and critically compare them to contemporary international ideas.  In particular the course will investigate practical settings that have been influenced by Froebelian ideas and consider how these locations differ from other workplaces, how Froebel's ideas have been embedded/adapted to take account of contemporary social change and the implications for educational policy and practice.",

    "summary": "The aim of the course is to critically engage with current discourses in and surrounding education, with particular focus on exploring how education is positioned in relation to visions of the 'future'. Students will reflect on how education is embedded in these discourses and use different philosophies to critically interrogate their implications for how we define, understand, and practice education today. The course also inquires into pedagogies and educational practices that seek to provide potential answers to the current challenges facing educational theory, policy, and practice.",
    "course_description": "This course examines current discourses in education with a high cultural, political, social relevance from a philosophical stance. By exploring a set of current issues in education (e.g., the relationship between education and technology, work, democracy), this course will critically interrogate how education is embedded within certain dystopian and utopian ideas of the future, and reflect on how that shapes our understanding of the nature and aims of education from a variety of perspectives. In the course, students will engage with contemporary and classic philosophical literature, policy documents, as well as works of fiction, film, and other creative works of art.",

    "summary": "The history of western philosophy promotes a search for and love of wisdom. The pursuance of wisdom has never been as important as it is now, knowing that the survival of the human species requires changes to the way we live our modern lives.  The context for this search lies within a contemporary world characterised by a changing atmosphere, degraded land and seascape, reduced biodiversity, yet infinite beauty. Through Place-Based approaches to education this course will explore ways of improving the relationship between human beings and the planet we inhabit.  Inquiry as stance will be explored as a method of enquiry intended to seek out the knowledge and wisdom necessary to develop action competences that promote sustainable living.  This philosophical background provides the basis from which to consider the implications for city-based outdoor learning.The planet is experiencing the largest urban growth in its history and so the way that people experience city environments is central to the quest for sustainable living.  This course focuses on being outdoors and indoors in city environments to explore how these settings might be used to provide inspiration toward sustainable living.  Key to this enquiry is the notion of presence and phenomenology which suggest that the way in which people experience the places they inhabit influences their values.  Thus, the idea of presence becomes central to the issue of our everyday personal and social identity that has wider moral implications for the way we relate to the planet.",
    "course_description": "The course is rooted in the tradition of Place-Based Education and seeks to explore the relationship between indoor and outdoor learning, motivation and pro-environmental behaviour.  It specifically takes note of the proclamation from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO, 2019:1) that all levels and forms of existing educational and teaching and learning programmes need to be reviewed and re-oriented to address the causes and consequences of climate change (and biodiversity loss).  Using this proclamation as a sounding board this course will explore city-based outdoor learning and the opportunities available in the development of programmes intended to address the transition towards sustainable living.",

The presentation will be recorded for the purpose of moderation and available to the external examiner where two academic staff are not present for marking and moderation. Students will need to refer to the Presentation Rubric to establish the assessment criteria.Prior to the Presentation Day (12pm on the day prior) students are to submit a copy of their presentation, an Abstract (500 words) for the presentation and a full reference list from the presentation and abstract.Refer back to the You Are Never Alone exercise and your presentation. Use your personal experience of a place in the city and your reflections on People, Place, and You to write this assignment.

The course commences with the fundamental motivation that propels individuals towards achieving excellence.  Performers with desire but no direction will rarely succeed and so the course then develops a logical appreciation of the role of and techniques for developing focussed goal-directed behaviours. The course then examines how the psychology of learning and instruction can inform the application of effective strategies for the development of expert skills.The concept of planning to achieve elite performance is extended to include periodised plans required to encapsulate the necessary long term perspective.",

Students consider the notion of problem identification as well as problem solving and ethical decision making through real-world problems and examples of curricula.Through the course students explore the development of subject specific knowledge required to enable them to understand progression and conceptual development; appropriate enquiry and assessment practices that inform curriculum design, planning for teaching that will progress learning. Students will analyse and critique research-informed theory in each disciplinary area, drawing on subject-based and wider educational perspectives.Students will explore key theories and concepts underpinning various curricular designs; considering the intent and values-base of different models; eg. curriculum as prescription, as experience, learner-centered, society-centered, knowledge-centered. This will include critically analysing conceptual knowledge in disciplines such as expressive arts, social studies, and religious and moral education. This approach recognises that children's capacity to communicate their thoughts, values and beliefs critically and creatively and using different modes of expression is foundational for learning and teaching.The course will facilitate development of the pedagogical content knowledge (Shulman, 1986) necessary for effective teaching and progression of student learning. This includes understanding of languages and literacies learning and teaching in primary schools, to ensure children become language users in a diverse world. Students will explore core STEAM concepts in the primary years. This will include in-depth exploration of learnersÂ¿ paths of progression, common misconceptions and powerful ways of representing core concepts to support learning. There will also be support for student teachers in auditing their own numeracy knowledge in order to identify and address any gaps in the knowledge they will need to underpin effective teaching of STEAM topics.Focussing on approaches to development of childrenÂ¿s foundational understanding in each discipline will be complemented by an interdisciplinary focus that will facilitate critical reflection on common concerns. This will include research-informed consideration of methods for primary STEAM, literacies, social subjects, expressive arts and physical education, such as teaching through various interdisciplinary approaches, problem solving and enquiry, expressive arts pedagogies, outdoor learning and use of digital technologies and digital pedagogies.",

The PDP is comprised of field courses (which vary according to Outdoor Education (OE) and Outdoor Environmental & Sustainability Education (OESE) degree programmes). The field courses specific to each degree programme (OE/OESE) take advantage of the unique attributes of Scotland's spectacular landscape. As students inevitably possess a range of backgrounds and abilities, the goals of the individual field courses are to experience living on and travelling through the Scottish landscape, increase technical and practical abilities at a level that is individually appropriate, and link the theory and practice of outdoor/outdoor environmental education.See website for further details: http://www.ed.ac.uk/education/institutes/etl/outdoor-education/programmes/professional-development-programme",

    "course_description": "This course is part of the deaf education pathway which qualifies teachers to work with deaf children. It is also open to other students from the School who are qualified teachers and have already taken a course from the deaf education pathway. Deaf learners are a very diverse group; most attend their local schools while some are in specialist resource bases and deaf schools. This course focuses on how curriculum and assessment opportunities can be adapted to deaf learners, focusing particularly on the progression of literacy skills throughout the school years. We explore language policies held by governments, local authorities and individuals, which often influence the curriculum opportunities available to deaf children in school. Students will explore theories of literacy development in relation to deaf learners, and pedagogies which may be in English only, bilingual, or using multilingual and translingual practices. By the end of the course, students will have critically explored one curriculum area in depth including the literacy demands across more than one curriculum stage. Students develop creative solutions to these demands, aiming to prevent a literacy gap with hearing peers. We examine deaf children's access to curriculum and assessment through listening and speechreading, notetaking, BSL/English interpreting, and online learning. The particular context for national examinations and assessments in different parts of the UK are critically examined; this is an area of active research within Moray House School of Education and Sport. Deaf children's rights, including those of deaf children with additional disabilities, of different ethnic backgrounds and socioeconomic status, are considered throughout the course: their views should be listened to in relation to how curriculum and assessment practices are adapted to their needs.",

This assignment is not graded.Students will work with a Critical Friend and look at their journal entries for weeks 1-4.Together, they write one short  (500-600 word) reflective essay in which they:-\tdescribe an aspect of their learning-\tanalyse what is changing, or has changed, in their thinking about teacher education-\trelate this to a context or contexts with which they are familiar.Students are encouraged do this with their Critical Friend because the process of writing together involves saying out loud what they are thinking and having to collaborate to reach a shared understanding helping both of them to sort out what they actually believe. It is easier if students agree on the same aspect of their learning (e.g. the concept of the teacher's knowledge base). The writing will perhaps include a comparison how each student feels their thinking is changing. Examples from the journals should be used to support the claims that are made.References to the relevant academic literature should be included (minimum 3, maximum 10).Note: This assignment is formative: it practices the skills needed for the Critical Review of Reflective Journal essay (Part 1) of the course assessment.2. Final assignmentThis assignment is in two parts.Part 1.Part 1 is based on the reflective journal* which you will write every week during the course.You are required to write a critical review of the way your ideas about teaching and teacher learning, and your own reflective writing, have developed over the course. You should use the journal entries as data which you can include in the assignment as evidence. This part of the assessment is particularly relevant for(*The reflective journal is a place for writing about any topics or issues which interest you as a result of studying the Second Language Teacher Education course. You may wish to discuss topics that have reinforced, influenced or changed your ideas on teaching and the training of other teachers. You may also wish to write about your practical experiences in the classroom, or within teacher education contexts, and show how these relate to theory.  These reflections must be supported with the relevant literature that is discussed on a weekly basis during the course. You are encouraged to develop your writing to be more than just descriptive so that you begin to ask questions about SLTE and discuss possible answers as you write down your thoughts. In your writing about specific ideas, you are also encouraged to think about the wider social context in which second language teachers work.You are required to write your journal reflections on a facility set up by the course tutor on LEARN.  The journal is a public document which can be seen by class members and tutors. This means that the content of the journal needs to be appropriate and follow professional standards.  You are required to post weekly comments on the reflections of two other class members in order to facilitate a critical reflective process.  Tutors on the course will comment twice on each student's journal.)1200 words*. This part is worth 30% of the total.This part relates to Learning Outcomes 3 and 4.Part 2.Part 2 requires you to plan and critically evaluate a proposal for SLTE in a second language teaching context with which you are familiar. The proposal is not for a single training session but rather an appropriate programme of SLTE to meet some needs that you have identified. The decisions you make should be based on current theory of SLTE. Your paper will show that you know what is considered important for teachers to learn and how teachers are thought to learn.You should make clear how your practical activities are applying the theory. In your writing, there should be a balance theory and practice and you will support your ideas with references to relevant literature.You should describe the context (in which you have been a teacher or a learner).You should identify the content of the SLTE you propose and explain what is to be included and why it is relevant and necessary.You should explain how the SLTE will take place (e.g. the time period, the type of activities the teacher educator and teacher-learners will take part in, how you will evaluate the SLTE). You should justify your ideas with reference to theory about how teachers learn. You should indicate what you think are the strengths and possible weaknesses in you plan.2,800 words**. This part is worth 70% of the total. This part of the assessment relates to Learning Outcomes 1, 2 and 5.**References are not part of the word count."

    "course_description": "This course covers key concepts, theories and trends in the field of Foreign/Second Language Education in general, and in TESOL in particular. We examine these fields within the context of the curriculum. Teaching methods are often seen as the most important factor in ensuring the success of a programme, yet it is also essential to look at how the various factors in the teaching-learning process interact with each other. However, in the 21st century, it is also crucial to address the dynamic interplay between the elements of any given curriculum (needs analysis, syllabus, aims and objectives, methodology, assessment, evaluation) and the teacherÂ¿s place as agent of change. In doing so, we develop our critical understanding of the complexity of ideologies behind curricula. We also address issues related to curriculum innovation, such as sustainability, decolonisation and (global) citizenship in Foreign/Second Language Education.Through reflective practice, collaborative dialogue and group presentations, we will explore key issues and practices within language curriculum development in order to provide the basis for more effective planning and also decision making in our classrooms, as in language programme development, implementation, and review. We will focus on the importance of understanding the contexts in which Foreign/Second Language curricula are designed and implemented. We will examine, for instance, ScotlandÂ¿s Curriculum for Excellence as a model to critique other Foreign/Second Language Teaching Curricula.The aim of the course is to equip you with the ability to make a number of decisions regarding your curriculum before, during and after teaching. We will be addressing the various changes in the field of Foreign/Second Language Education over the years, such as the matter of decolonizing curricula, or sustainability. We will be discussing the pedagogical implications of, on the one hand, the use of English as a global language, and on the other hand, the multilingual turn, as both shifts have increased the complexity of curricula. We will explore curriculum innovation in light of these developments and how language educators/TESOL practitioners have attempted to accommodate new insights into language and into language learning.The purpose of this course is not to provide you with a curriculum model but to introduce critical tools and different case studies to illustrate how curriculum design is approached in different contexts. Ultimately, our aim is to help you develop your role of teachers as agent of change in your specific settings.",

    "course_description": "This course explores the relationship with time in education and in early childhood education in particular. It examines the factors that have contributed to accelerated childhoods and the pressures on time experienced by young children, educators and communities. Set against this background the course explores alternative slow pedagogies that enable a different pace and rhythm and offer a range of ways of relating to past, present and future in education. The course draws on historical and contemporary sources including the work of Friedrich Froebel (1782-1852) and the principles based on his writings.Conceptual and theoretical reading will be matched by practical examples and discussion about what slow practices in early childhood education and care can look like. These topics include such themes as slow practices and the relationship with the outdoors, slow practices and materials, with everyday routines and with stories. Questions are raised about what slow research in early childhood might look like and how this links to research methods that centre of listening to young children and to adults. The course ends with critical reflection on slow pedagogies as alternatives to impatient models of education. Students consider how slowing down might in turn create opportunities to think about urgent issues for 21st century childrenand the planet.This course should appeal to a diverse range of students (including international students) with an interest in exploring alternative narratives in education and in Early Learning and Childcare (ELC) in particular. A core reader for the module: Slow Knowledge and the Unhurried Child: time for slow pedagogies in early childhood education (Clark, A.) has been published in January 2023 by Routledge in the Contesting Early Childhood series and offers international perspectives on this topic. This reader will be supplemented by a range of supporting articles that offer alternative perspectives on the relationship with time in ELC.

This course aims to provide students with an understanding of the sources and mechanisms of the reproduction of social inequalities in education. It will cover issues of conceptualisation and measurement of social inequality, theoretical explanations and empirical evidence from various countries across the globe.",
    "course_description": "Education is one of the most important factors for improving individuals' life chances. However, educational opportunities are not equally distributed among different social groups and are highly dependent on the context in which people are born. The aim of the course is to introduce students to key issues, theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence on social stratification in education for a wide variety of countries across the globe. The course will start with an introduction to the basic concepts and central theoretical perspectives and themes in social stratification research in education. In particular, the session will focus on the role of family, institutions (such as the education system and the labour market) and place (i.e. where people live) in shaping social inequalities in education as well as on the intersectionality of different dimensions of inequalities. The course will then critically engage with the recent empirical evidence from Africa, America, Asia and Europe.Students will be required to read a selection of articles, book chapters and working papers containing theoretical arguments and empirical evidence in relation to specific themes (e.g. the nature of social inequalities, measures of inequality, the mechanisms behind the reproduction of inequalities, the role of institutions, etc.), reflect on these themes and then critically discuss them during class.",

This course aims to look into the process of production, distribution and consumption of sport as a cultural commodity.  This cultural commodity includes both mediated texts and various symbols circulated in a global marketplace. The use of new technology in this production-consumption circuit and its impact are also examined from the viewpoint of 1) technological determinism, 2) political economy and 3) the diffusion of innovation. A systematic review of the connection between sport and the global culture industry enables students to assess the macroeconomic value of sport and to interpret ideological meanings embedded in the promotion of cultural commodities related to sport. Unequal power relations between the West and the non-West in the sport culture industry are critically examined, and such a critical review also helps students develop a capacity to decolonise the global sport culture industry.",
    "course_description": "This course offers theoretically informed critical discussion on the production, distribution, promotion and consumption of sport as a cultural commodity. In terms of theories, this course draws on various concepts from sociology, political science, macroeconomics and cultural studies. A comprehensive understanding of these theoretical notions enables students to produce a plausible academic and professional review of sports cultural commodities in circulation. This course also encourages students to adopt international and intercultural perspectives when discussing key components and stakeholders in a highly globalised sport culture industry today.Whole group lectures, small group seminars and independent learning through the reading of relevant research papers are the main modes of course delivery. Seminar activities include a group discussion, student-led tasks and critical peer reviews, and each student is encouraged to contribute their intellectual input to these activities. A major focal point of this student-led learning includes theoretical and critical analysis of contemporary issues in sport culture industry. By taking part in these activities, students can accumulate an academic ability to develop a succinct critical review of cultural commodities in the sports industry. Students also enhance their literacy skills for understanding both the denotative and connotative meanings embedded in sports cultural texts.",

    "summary": "Media-sport is now the recognised term for describing the sport and media nexus.  This course seeks to develop this well-established area of study, analysing long-term and contemporary developments that have emerged in the world of mediated sport.  The media has helped construct what is meant by sport and continues to play a central role in the process by which dominant, residual and emergent sport practices and meanings are defined, legitimated and marginalised.  These relationships are continually evolving alongside new media technological developments.  The relationships between sport and the media should, therefore, form a central element in the social scientific study of contemporary sport management. Focusing on ideological elements of media-sport, a number of sports management case studies are analysed ranging from sport and militarism to sport and global justice.",

Examining the interplay between theory and practice, it critically discusses how sport has contributed to various campaigns and policies designed to address deep-seated social and economic problems.  The course charts the evolution of the sport and international development movement, and critically examines the power relations that lie behind common sense and functional rhetoric associated with it.  It critically examines the motivations of those organisations within the Global North who often initiate sport for international development projects, and how these create competing interpretations of aid and development.  The course explains these issues through key theoretical frameworks and links to the wider social, economic and political context.  It also critically discusses methodological challenges faced when evaluating sport for international development interventions within a highly political context.  The course promotes advocacy on a number of fronts.",

    "summary": "This course uses the Student-Led Individually Created Course (SLICC) university-wide framework for self-designed experiential learning.  It offers a highly flexible yet supported approach, where students develop their own defined experience or series of related activities and experiences with a theme, to address their own specific academic and professional demands. Students reflect regularly and throughout their defined experience, specifically by reflective blogging, which they collect and curate as a reflective e-portfolio, to provide evidence of their learning.As a participating student, undertaking a SLICC will enable you to create a learning experience which is unique to you and your own needs and academic and professional aims.  You will demonstrate your learning and academic achievement against learning outcomes in a defined experiential learning and assessment framework.This course will require you to demonstrate the development of your skills and understanding in terms of critical analysis, application, self-reflection, recognising and developing your skills and mindsets, and evaluation within the context of the learning experience you have defined. This course will also enable you to demonstrate your ability to exercise autonomy and initiative, and deal with challenges that may present themselves in an academic subject/discipline (or other approved) area, and/or at an applied professional level in practice.",
    "course_description": "A SLICC requires you to propose, develop and manage your own learning experience within a supported learning and assessment framework that will enable you to evidence how you have achieved the learning outcomes of the course.  It offers you autonomy and flexibility to address your own learning requirements, and academic and professional needs.Your self-designed learning experience is required to adhere to a defined learning and assessment framework that supports and enables you to self-direct and manage your own learning experience. Within this structure however, you have real autonomy and flexibility regarding the topic or theme, content of study and nature of your experience, provided your proposal is academically feasible, and is approved by your tutor.Your SLICC may, for example, be based upon a particular extra-curricular learning opportunity such as an internship, work experience, pro-bono activity, community engagement, volunteering, study-abroad or indeed may be entirely self-directed. In agreement with your own programme, your SLICC could also be based on your wider co-curricular range of activities in which you engage to support your main course of study, and how these contribute to your wider development.  These may include your learning and its usage and application, from what would otherwise be co- or extra-curricular activities.   It may focus on a theme of professional and /or personal interest such as sustainability, social responsibility, external engagement, equality and cultural diversity, or a disciplinary or interdisciplinary-based research theme or application.This course can enable flexibility in course delivery and curriculum design for students in their postgraduate programme.  By way of examples, students may be working on interdisciplinary activities, in groups from different years of study.  Activities may be exploring 'wicked' or global problems, where there is a risk of achieving a perceived successful outcome, if that is defined as a project report.The steps in undertaking a SLICC are as follows:1) Identify a suitable opportunity within which to undertake your learning experience2) Write your draft proposal and submit to your tutor/advisor for approval3) Self-direct and manage your own learning experience, as detailed within the framework4) Actively and regularly reflect upon and document your experience with evidence and use that as a basis for writing your self-critical 'Interim Reflective Report', then your 'Final Reflective Report'5) Formatively self-assess and submit your 'Final Reflective Report' for summative assessment by your tutor.The steps identified above each require a significant amount of thought and input and will ultimately form part of a 'time-based' e-portfolio of reflective evidence, which you will curate and use in the assessment of your SLICC.Undertaking a SLICC you will not only develop the content of your learning experience but also produce an agreed portfolio of outputs.  You must evidence what you have learned and, importantly, where you demonstrate how you have met the learning outcomes for the course.",

    "summary": "Students undertaking this course will develop a critical understanding of theories of learning, teaching and assessment of English in the upper primary and secondary sector. They will learn how to use theoretical knowledge about subject and pedagogy in English to devise  teaching which is designed to meet the needs and interests of diverse learners.  The course will be underpinned by the related theoretical concepts of critical pedagogy and critical literacies.",
    "course_description": "English teaching in the 21st century is multi-faceted , challenging, stimulating  and fascinating for the teacher.  For the learner successful learning in English is essential to becoming a citizen who can negotiate and act on the their understanding of the many complex, multimodal texts which they encounter each day. A transformative teacher of English can make the difference between someone who is a passive recipient of information and someone who can access and inform their culture, their society and their own life through their ability to deconstruct and construct texts (whatever form or medium of text), and to engage with confident, analytical criticality in discussion and debate in the classroom and beyond.The OECD report (2015) questioned what was perceived as  the lack of focus in Scottish education in terms of  the 'pedagogical core', the fundamental experience of learning and teaching .  This course seeks to develop teachers of English who are able to make  use of their understanding of pedagogical and deep subject  knowledge to teach in order to purposefully  include and to take account of the diverse needs and interests of  learners. Teachers undertaking this course would therefore develop critical and situated  awareness   of themselves in their role as a teacher - a role which is political, cultural, social and moral and about taking action. To this end the course is underpinned by theories of critical pedagogy and critical literacies.Students on this course will learn how to critique curricula at policy level which relates to their subject teaching  in order to develop purposeful, engaging teaching. Using  Friere, Shor, Hooks, Janks and more school classroom based texts on critical literacies  such as Morgan, students will explore and develop their knowledge and understanding of the following areas of learning and teaching in the secondary English classroom so that they can:- analyse and critique curricula at policy level and at classroom delivery level within the English subject discipline in order to develop purposeful, engaging teaching for learners from P5 - S6- learn how to teach about, with and through different kinds of texts, including media texts, paying particular attention to Scottish texts which inform the cultural heritage of children and young people learning in Scottish schools- learn how to teach the construction of different kinds of texts,  including multi modal and digital texts- learn how to explore the aesthetic within reading and within children and young peoples' own writing, with learners-develop understanding of assessment  within the context of English teaching in the secondary school so that student teachers are familiar with Broad and General and National 4, 5, Higher and Advanced Higher requirements and can implement this  within the subject specialism of English- begin the process of becoming a reflective and reflexive practitionerStudents taking this course will work in collaborative groups in seminars and in directed study time, both in university and in cluster sites. Learning will be problem based and students will be expected to contribute extensively in seminar sessions.",

    "course_description": "This course builds on Subject Specialism: English (1), providing an opportunity for students to further enhance their ability to make theory-practice connections, acknowledging that learning to teach is an iterative process requiring deep and progressive intellectual and practical engagement.English teaching in the 21st century is multi faceted , challenging, stimulating and fascinating for the teacher. For the learner successful learning in English is essential to becoming a citizen who can negotiate and act on the their understanding of the many complex, multimodal texts which they encounter each day. A transformative teacher of English can make the difference between someone who is a passive recipient of information and someone who can access and inform their culture, their society and their own life through their ability to deconstruct and construct texts (whatever form or medium of text), and to engage with confident, analytical criticality in discussion and debate in the classroom and beyond.The OECD report (2015) questioned what was perceived as the lack of focus in Scottish education in terms of the 'pedagogical core', the fundamental experience of learning and teaching . This course seeks to develop teachers of English who are able to make use of their understanding of pedagogical and deep subject knowledge to teach in order to purposefully include and to take account of the diverse needs and interests of learners. Teachers undertaking this course would therefore develop critical and situated awareness of themselves in their role as a teacher - a role which is political, cultural, social and moral and about taking action. To this end the course is underpinned by theories of critical pedagogy and critical literacies.Students on this course will learn how to critique curricula at policy level which relates to their subject teaching in order to develop purposeful, engaging teaching. Using Friere, Shor, Hooks, Janks and more school classroom based texts on critical literacies such as Morgan, students will explore and develop their knowledge and understanding of the following areas of learning and teaching in the English classroom so that they can:- analyse and critique curricula at policy level and at classroom delivery level within the English subject discipline in order to develop purposeful, engaging teaching for learners from P5 - S6- learn how to teach about, with and through different kinds of texts, including media texts, paying particular attention to Scottish texts which inform the cultural heritage of children and young people learning in Scottish schools- learn how to teach the construction of different kinds of texts, including multi modal and digital texts- learn how to explore the aesthetic within reading and within children and young peoples' own writing, with learners-develop understanding of assessment within the context of English teaching in the secondary school so that student teachers are familiar with Broad and General and National 4, 5, Higher and Advanced Higher requirements and can implement this within the subject specialism of English- begin the process of becoming a reflective and reflexive practitionerThis second year of the course will  continue learning in the areas outlined above but will utilise  different models of teacher reflection as a lens to consider teacher reflection and reflexivity in practice.Students taking this course will work in collaborative groups in seminars and in directed study time, both in university and in cluster sites. Learning will be problem based and students will be expected to contribute extensively in seminar sessions.",

    "summary": "This course builds on learning in the first year of the programme for Languages. Students undertaking this course will continue to develop their theory of practice which is informed by a critical understanding of learning, teaching and assessment of languages.  This course will provide students with a background to language policies and their articulation with classroom practices in the upper primary and lower secondary stages.The National Framework for Languages for Initial Teacher Education (2018) will be used to inform the development of such theory-policy-practice integration.  Throughout the course, students will learn how to design language rich learning environments which are inclusive and which meet the needs and interests of diverse learners.  Students on this course are graduates of Gaelic, Latin, and Modern Languages (e.g. French, Spanish, German).  However, school based experience in primary schools may afford opportunities to observe and plan for language activities in other languages, such as BSL.",
    "course_description": "This course builds on Subject Specialism: Languages (1) and provides students with further guided opportunities to enhance their ability to develop their own theory of practice bridging deepening theoretical understanding and related implications for designing the languages classroom in ways which are motivating and challenging for all learners. Learning to teach is an iterative learning process which requires deep and progressive intellectual analysis alongside practical engagement. It requires an understanding of the demands made on learners which encourage self-agency and risk-taking and ways in which mentoring learning can lead to deeper learning. A particular emphasis on dialogic classrooms, using language for and through learning and task sequencing for progression will be supported by the National Framework for Languages (ITE).This course delves further into the notion of building linguistic and social capital and ensuring young people's entitlement to develop a useful range of language(s) skills is fundamental to educational systems across the world. Language as a holistic concept and its role in education - both as a communication tool and as a learning tool - is at the core of learning. It is also complex and challenging. Language learning and using are open to wide (mis)interpretations leading to a range of different and at times conflicting pedagogic approaches.  Given the rapidly changing nature of learners and learning in schools in terms of first languages, cultures and life experiences, languages as a learning tool and as linguistic systems to be understood and progressed, demand critical analysis of plurilingual, pluriliteracies and pluricultural contributions.  To design socially just and equitable environments in order to prepare learners for global citizenship involves motivating and enabling learners to understand how language systems promote communication in socially and culturally diverse communities, across regions and nations, supported by transcultural awareness which make transparent inherent values and beliefs. In addition, the use of languages to promote literacies and cognitive development - regardless of the age and ability of the individual - requires language-rich environments. A transformative languages teacher enables all learners to communicate appropriately, understand the value of language and languages for personal, societal and global benefit, and to learn how to use languages in increasingly cognitively demanding settings. To make this happen, students will be engaged in critical analysis of languages in use (including learning) in different communities, taking account of the diverse needs of learners and related issues of identities and successful learning. This will involve confident, analytical criticality in discussion and debate in the classroom and beyond.The OECD report (2015) demanded a 'new narrative' for Scotland's national curriculum. For languages to make a significant contribution to this narrative, critical evaluation and reconceptualization of the nature of language learning and teaching, its role in interdisciplinary settings and as a medium for learning is essential. This course seeks to develop teachers who are able to effectively use their understanding of pedagogical and socio-cultural language knowledge and skills to design and teach in an inclusive and language-rich environment. Teachers undertaking this course will therefore develop critical and situated awareness of themselves in their role as a teacher - a role which is political, cultural, social and moral and about taking action. To this end the course is underpinned by theories of critical pedagogy and critical literacies.Students on this course will further develop their skills in critiquing relevant curricula at policy level in order to develop purposeful, engaging teaching.  Students will continue to explore and develop their knowledge and understanding of the following areas of learning and teaching in language and interdisciplinary classrooms so that they can:- demonstrate how an analysis and critique of curricula at policy level and at classroom level  has the potential to develop purposeful, engaging teaching for learners, with particular focus on the secondary school stage- deepen understanding of integrated language theories, systemic functional linguistics, cultural and learning theories, and use these to inform classroom practices- enable learners to learn to use languages, and use languages to learn, paying particular attention to the diverse cultural heritage of learners and their languages-  demonstrate the connection between language and literacies across the curriculum in multimodal ways- learn how to communicate effectively, and understand different ways in which languages can support meaning-making, in increasingly complex situations- design effective learning spaces which are dialogic and challenging - making learning progression transparent- learn how to develop specific language skills (reading and writing) using cognitive functions in social and culturally appropriate and effective ways- understand and demonstrate how assessment, when embedded in learning and teaching, can lead to deeper learning involving self, peers, teachers and others.- develop understanding of assessment within the context of languages teaching in the secondary school so that students are familiar with, and can implement, Broad and General and National 4, 5, Higher and Advanced Higher requirements- continue the process of becoming and being a reflective and reflexive practitioner through further iterations of a theory of practiceThroughout the second year course, key principles drawn from the first course will be further developed, analysed, critiqued to encourage teacher reflection. Students taking this course will work in collaborative groups in seminars and in directed study time, both in university and in cluster sites. Learning will be problem-based and students will be expected to contribute extensively in seminar sessions.The course will comprise 10 hours of whole group teaching/ tutor contact.Students will engage in 35 hours of site-based learning and 20 hours of directed study on campus.Independent Learning of 35 hours completes the breakdown of learning and teaching activities.",

Throughout the course, students will learn how to design language rich learning environments which are inclusive and which meet the needs and interests of diverse learners.  Students on this course are graduates of Gaelic, Latin, and Modern Languages (e.g. French, Spanish, German).  However, school based experience in primary schools may afford opportunities to observe and plan for language activities in other languages, such as BSL.",
    "course_description": "The notion of building linguistic and social capital and ensuring young people's entitlement to develop a range of language (s) skills is fundamental to educational systems across the world. Language as a holistic concept and its role in education - both as a communication tool and as a learning tool - is at the core of learning. It is also complex and challenging. Language learning and using are open to wide (mis)interpretations leading to a range of different and at times conflicting pedagogic approaches.  Given the rapidly changing nature of learners and learning in schools in terms of first languages, cultures and life experiences, languages as a learning tool and as linguistic systems to be understood and progressed, demand critical analysis of plurilingual, pluriliteracies and pluricultural contributions.  In order to design socially just and equitable environments which prepare learners for global citizenship involves motivating and enabling learners to understand how language systems promote communication in socially and culturally diverse communities, across regions and nations, supported by transcultural awareness which make transparent inherent values and beliefs. In addition, the use of languages to promote literacies and cognitive development - regardless of the age and ability of the individual - requires safe, language-rich environments. A transformative languages teacher enables all learners to communicate appropriately, understand the value of language and languages for personal, societal and global benefit, and to learn how to use languages in increasingly demanding critical settings. To make this happen, students will be engaged in critical analysis of languages in use (including learning) in different communities, taking account of the diverse needs of learners and related issues of identities and successful learning. This will involve confident, analytical criticality in discussion and debate in the classroom and beyond.The OECD report (2015) demanded a 'new narrative' for Scotland's national curriculum. For languages to make a significant contribution to this narrative, critical evaluation and reconceptualization of the nature of language learning and teaching, its role in interdisciplinary settings and as a medium for learning is essential. This course seeks to develop teachers who are able to make use of their understanding of pedagogical and socio-cultural language knowledge and skills to design and teach in an inclusive and language-rich environment. Teachers undertaking this course will therefore develop critical and situated awareness of themselves in their role as a teacher - a role which is political, cultural, social and moral and about taking action. To this end the course is underpinned by theories of critical pedagogy and critical literacies.Students on this course will learn how to critique relevant curricula at policy level in order to develop purposeful, engaging teaching.  Students will explore and develop their knowledge and understanding of the following areas of learning and teaching in language and interdisciplinary classrooms so that they can:- analyse and critique curricula at policy level and at classroom level in order to develop purposeful, engaging teaching for learners from P5 - S3-  build on a widening understanding of integrated language theories, systemic functional linguistics, cultural and learning theories and use these to inform design principles for classroom practices- enable learners to learn to use languages, and use languages to learn, paying particular attention to the diverse cultural heritage of learners and their languages-  connect languages and literacies to wider learning across the curriculum-  design effective learning spaces which are language-rich and challenging, making learning progression transparent-  understand the role of languaging for meaning-making across languages and in a variety of multimodal ways.- learn how to develop specific language skills (e.g. reading and writing) using cognitive functions in social and culturally appropriate and effective ways-  understand and demonstrate how assessment, when embedded in learning and teaching, can lead to deeper learning involving self, peers, teachers and others.-  develop understanding of assessment within the context of languages teaching in the broad general education-  begin the process of becoming a reflective and reflexive practitioner through early iterations of a theory of practiceStudents taking this course will work in collaborative groups in seminars and in directed study time, both in university and in cluster sites. Learning will be problem-based and students will be expected to contribute extensively in seminar sessions.The course will comprise 10 hours of whole group teaching/ tutor contact.Students will engage in 35 hours of site-based learning and 20 hours of directed study on campus.Independent Learning of 35 hours completes the breakdown of learning and teaching activities.",

We will apply the theory to an integrated skills approach, addressing the structure and function of language, and different learning contexts. Teacher learners will collaborate in planning and designing lessons for micro-teaching, and reflect on their teaching experiences, adopting critical incident analysis and the principle of the critical friend.Students on this course also benefit from the TESOL Methodology School Visits which provide them with the opportunity to observe teachers in action during their visit to a Scottish school.BLOCK 4: Revision, Questions and Reflection We will revise and explore questions relating to teaching approaches, the assignment, and situated contexts, engaging with teacher learners' lived and hoped-for professional experience.",

The teacher's role is constantly changing in the context of local, national and global developments: the course considers a range of teacher literacies that are central to transformative, activist teaching in contemporary times, whilst acknowledging that teachers will need to further develop these and other literacies over their professional careers.Preparing teachers for a changing world is a theme underpinning the programme as whole, but it is in this course that we explicitly consider the knowledge, skills, capacities, habits and dispositions associated with the particular forms of literacy that teachers will need to develop.",
    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionContemporary education systems exist within a complex web of contexts characterised by (among other things) the intensification of neo-liberal policy objectives, high and growing levels of material inequality, the increasing global movement of people, rapid developments in digital communication, and the need to mitigate potential worldwide catastrophes such as global warming. These and other factors combine to produce school-level contexts that require teachers to develop sophisticated understandings of the world around them if they are to lead change rather than be buffeted by it. Following the work of Habermas, skilled teachers need to be critical readers of their own professional lifeworlds, and they need to know how to enable pupils to develop similar critical reading capacities.Critical reading as used here means more than simply not taking things at face value: it implies a critique of the status quo. A teacher who is a critical reader of her or his lifeworld has the knowledge, skills, capacities, habits and disposition to interrogate how schooling has been complicit in reproducing inequalities, and to teach in ways that produce newer, more equal social relations and economic outcomes. Critical reading involves extensive and detailed knowledge of a range of theories that interrogate power and privilege, in order to use such theories to critique and develop practice.Critical reading can thus be understood as a process which will already have started before students enter the programme. In earlier courses in the programme, students will be developing critical reading skills in relation to university-based and site-based work, and will be engaging with critical theories. This course aims to engage students in explicit discussion of the importance of critical reading of their educational lifeworlds, to establish robust entry levels of each of the modes of literacy, and to enable students to develop the knowledge, skills, capacities, habits and dispositions associated with a career-long commitment to their own critical reading and that of their pupils.In order to understand and break down the knowledge and skills associated with critical reading of a teacher's lifeworld, the course has been conceptualised according to five distinct but interrelated modes of literacy, reflecting contemporary forms of communication. These are outlined in alphabetical order, as there is no intention to prioritise any one: all are important, intersecting and indispensable.1)\tDigital literacy: the knowledge and skills to learn and to work confidently, creatively and safely in online and digital environments, and a critical understanding of the possibilities and limitations of digital media in teaching for positive social change.2)\tInter-professional literacy: the knowledge and skills to understand the (sometimes competing) priorities of distinct professional groups, and to work in ways that acknowledge and are sensitive to distinct workplace cultures3)\tLinguistic literacy: the knowledge and skills to consciously access one's own linguistic resources, to understand how language works and constitutes perceived reality, to understand the relationship between language and power, and to learn and work confidently in multi-lingual environments4)\tPolitical literacy: the knowledge and skills to read 'everyday' events politically, to understand the connections between the local and the global, to work confidently with the ideas and forms of thought used to articulate political issues, to identify and deconstruct dominant narratives, and to understand the (educational) policy process5)\tStatistical literacy: the knowledge and skills to think critically about statistical information, to use statistical tools to develop and communicate practice, and to make robust educational decisions based on statistical informationThe habits and dispositions associated with critical reading of one's lifeworld cut across multiple literacies. They are developed through a conscious foregrounding of questioning a text (be it statistical, digital, written, oral, pictorial or in any other form) to identify how it functions as a vehicle for social stasis and/or social change.Outline ContentThe course will in part be based upon a problem-based learning (PBL) approach which will require students to develop and demonstrate the habits and dispositions of critical literacy, as well as to assimilate and use key knowledge. The content will therefore support students in addressing the three substantive tasks (see sections on student experience and assessment) as a relevant and student-centred way of introducing key ideas. The following will be covered, though not necessarily in the order presented:Critical theory and critical literacies: Habermas, Husserl and educational lifeworlds; identifying and contesting dominant narratives (Fairclough, 1995); minimal and maximal notions of citizenship (McGlaughlin, 1992)Reading education policy: neoliberalism and marketisation (Apple, 2005); statistics, the governed soul and the new managerialist project (Rose, 1990, Lynch, 2014); GERM resistance (Sahlberg, 2012)Critical readings of education: Friere and education for democracy; teacher unions and activism; feminism and the relationship between the personal and the political (Fraser, 2015); education and the mediaReading statistics: key statistical methods; uses and abuses of statistics; statistics in practitioner researchCritical literacy: deconstructing texts (Fairclough, 2005); inter-textuality; reading between and beyond the lines; meta-linguistic strategiesSchooling as a site of struggle: reading school micro politics (Ball, 2013); multiple and intersecting cultures (pupil, teacher, interprofessional, community) (Epstein, 2010)Teaching for critical literacies: strategies and approaches to teaching children to become critical readers of their lifeworlds (Comber, 2016; Dixon, 2011)Student ExperienceSeminars: 20 hoursStructured (PBL) group activities: 100 hoursSelf-directed study, including reading, preparing for seminars, student-directed group work and working on individual assessed task: 80 hoursFrom the outset, students will be encouraged to use their existing knowledge, and particularly their site-based experiences, as the basis for interrogation. Seminar sessions will normally require students to complete preparatory work, often drawn from site-based learning experiences, and will be active in nature. Activities will vary according to students' interests and requirements and the research background of staff teaching each session.Group work will be focused on the following three PBL tasks:1) Working in groups of 3-5 people, students will identify and analyse a set of statistics relevant to education in Scotland, and use them to write at least two news stories which provide politically contrasting interpretations of the 'facts' and seek to persuade an imagined audience accordingly. Students will decide on the format their stories will take. The stories will be accompanied by an account (details to be negotiated) of how the group approached the task, including their use of particular linguistic, cultural and multi-modal devices to make persuasive cases.2) Small groups of students will constitute themselves as multi-agency teams working on a whole-school development issue. Each member of the group will lead on preparing a submission from the point of view of one professional or community member, and the group as a whole will work on an account of how the topic was identified and analysed, how conflicts were resolved, and final outcomes arrived at.3) In response to a local, national or global crisis or contentious issue, each student will develop a teaching activity designed to enable pupils of their chosen age range to ask questions and develop age-appropriate understanding. The activities will be presented in class (probably as an in-role teaching activity) to other students in role in small groups, with peer and tutor feedback.",

      "full_text": "Assessment will be associated with the three problem-based learning tasks.Task one (75% of total mark):Working in groups of 3-5 people, students will identify a set of statistics relevant to education in Scotland, and use them to write at least two news stories which provide politically contrasting interpretations of the 'facts' and seek to persuade an imagined audience accordingly. The stories can be presented as newspaper articles, blog entries, weblogs, documentaries, or other formats as appropriate: students can select a different format for each story, or use the same media for both/all. The choice of substantive focus and presentational format will be negotiable and student-directed. The stories will be accompanied by an account (the specifics of which are negotiable) of how the group approached the task, including their use of particular linguistic and multi-modal devices to make persuasive cases.Formative assessment will be integrated into this task via a class discussion in which each group will present a draft of at least one story, and receive feedback from peers and the tutor. During this discussion students will be encouraged to identify aspects on which they would like further feedback in relation to their summative submission.Groups who are considered to have successfully carried out this task will be awarded a mark of 65%, the criteria for which will be developed and agreed by the students and tutor. 65% is in the middle of the 'very good' band on Common Marking Scheme 4, and therefore constitutes an appropriate level for students to be aiming at in a course which will feature towards the end of their two-year programme. Individual students who would like the possibility of being awarded a higher grade will have the opportunity to negotiate an additional task with the course tutor. The additional task will need to demonstrate a more sophisticated understanding and use of the literacies involved in the component, not simply be additional material at the same level.Task two (formatively assessed):Working in groups of 3-5, students constitute themselves as a multi-agency team working on an aspect of whole-school development such as a redesign of outdoor space, or greater community involvement. Each member of the group leads on producing a submission from the point of view of a particular professional, and the group as a whole produce an account of the final outcome, including how any conflicts were resolved, and all voices attended to.Formative assessment will be within-groupTask three (25% of total mark):In response to a local, national or global crisis/contentious issue, students develop a teaching activity that will enable pupils of their chosen age range to ask questions and develop age-appropriate understanding. The activities will be presented in class to other students (probably in role in small groups), with formative peer and tutor feedback. Each student will present a 1000-word commentary (format negotiable) detailing the aims of their activity, how they selected and used resources, and how they might further develop and follow up the activity.Compensation is available on this course, i.e the final mark for the course will be the total of the two summative tasks, regardless of the individual scores for each."

Participants will have the opportunity to investigate and discuss critical and intercultural theory in relation to such texts; they will develop an understanding of and be able to analyse the different polemics within this area and they will develop an understanding of the relationship between this aspect of studying text and explore implications for language education pedagogies. Students will further come to understand that glocal citizens of all ages are subject to an unregulated mass of information from a variety of different kinds of text from which they have to make meaning andthat language educators can enable them to do this through selecting and teaching text from a critical literacy perspective. Students will have the opportunity to investigate methods of teaching text in order to enable children, young people and adult language learners develop investment, agency and intercultural competence in schools, university and society, including globalised digital environments. Students will also consider the links between literacies and inclusiveness.2) Outline ContentInteractive seminars will include two sessions each focussing on children's literature and picture books, young people's fiction, fillm and graphic novels, and world literature and cultural artefacts for adult language learning. Two further sessions will focus specifically on applied pedagogies for critical intercultural reading, including translation, process and product drama as a means of developing integrated language teaching and learning skills. Open access sources of published works and multimodal cultural artefacts will form the basis of the materials studied, framed within appropriate critical,intercultural and media literacy theory and examined in the context of relevant empirical research.3) Student Learning ExperienceStudents will be taught in weekly interactive seminars and encouraged to curate their own selections of texts for group learning and discussion, as well as for a microteaching task and assignment. The Course Organiser will provide both core cultural texts and theoretical readings of relevance to the weekly topics. EOLs will include student-led peer-reading activities, microteaching, posting and commenting on curated texts on shared media boards, and students will also write blogs and be invited to commenton each others' blogs.",

The outline of the lesson should be presented in an appendix with target level of learners, objectives and LOs, stages and timings. This outline should be annotated and clearly cross-referenced with the analysis presented in Part 2, which should address the rationale for the lesson design, justification and theoretical underpinnings for the chosen text, methodology, activities and intended outcomes and an evaluation of the proposed lesson(s).The assignment will be marked in line with the common postgraduate marking scheme set forward in the Taught Masters Generic Handbook, which students receive at the start of their studies and which is available online.Formative assessment will be provided on the basis of a 45 mn group micro-teaching task (in learning sets of five), with oral feedback from peers and tutor.

    "course_description": "This course explores how the insights and concepts gained through the discipline of social anthropology, including the ethnographic methodology that underlies it, can add to our understandings of educational theory and practice. At the same time it also aims to show how a detailed examination of teaching and learning processes in different cultural contexts might add to knowledge about the relationship between personhood, learning and culture. The course will pay attention to classic categories such as 'gender', 'class', 'race', 'kinship', 'religion' and 'nation', at the same time as acknowledging the complex intersectionality of these with respect to contemporary human experiences of migration. Study will be structured around cross-cultural comparisons of themes such as literacy, violence, citizenship, discipline, ritual, language and copying. Aspects of education and learning throughout the life course will be covered, as well as both formal (institutional) and informal practices of learning. In examining such processes in detail using ethnographic studies of education from around the world (regional foci will include India, China, the Pacific, the U.S., Europe, the Middle East and Latin America), this course aims to encourage students to think critically about both the potentials and problems of applying Western discourses, models and systems of education as a form of 'development'. It aims therefore to give students a confident, and culturally sensitive, grounding from which to make comparisons of teaching and learning in a global context.",

Task 1 (70%) Continuous Assessment of Reflective Journal.Â«br /Â»The journal will be composed of 4 entries : Entries 1 and 2 (1500 words) to be submitted together usually 4 weeks into the course; entries 3 and 4 (1500 words) submitted usually 8 weeks into the course. These word counts do not include the bibliography.Â«br /Â»Â«br /Â»The journal is a critical, reflective exploration of the reading and learning on the course. The content of the journal entry will be supported by: lectures, and reading for each seminar (2 to 3 articles) followed by the completion of a structured individual worksheet which is then shared with a group of peers and forms the basis of a group task. Tutor will provide formative feedback on all of these during seminars which should feed into the reflective journal. Additional readings will also be suggested each week which students may wish to follow up.Â«br /Â»Â«br /Â»Please note: a new set of criteria for how the reflective journal is marked will be provided, as will examples of journal entries.Â«br /Â»Â«br /Â»Â«br /Â»2. Task 2 (30%). Group Presentation: Critical Review of an Ethnographic Monograph.Â«br /Â»Students will be placed into groups depending on the choice they make between 5 or 6 ethnographic monographs (available as e-books). Students will be given responsibility to read the monograph during the semester with their group, to organize bi-weekly 'book group' meetings to discuss and make notes on this. They should prepare a group presentation on their chosen monograph for the seminar group. Group presentations will be videoed and a new set of marking criteria developed. In addition, students will be asked to express, in their reflective diaries, what their contribution to bi-weekly book group meetings and the group presentation was, and to highlight aspects of self and peer involvement that they think are important. The latter is to ensure that discrepancies in contribution or issues are brought to the attention of the tutor.Â«br /Â»Â«br /Â»ALL students taking this course will need to achieve at least 40% of the total marks available in Task 1 AND 40% of total marks available in Task 2 in order to pass."

Through case studies, the course will examine the change and development of curricula to locate different traditions and theories into practice. The course provides students with an opportunity to synthesise ideas, debate and evaluate a range of values, purposes and practices associated with curriculum changes within and across various global contexts.",
    "course_description": "Indicative Course ContentSession 1.  Curriculum Studies and Key ConceptsThis week will provide a foundation for the course by introducing key concepts including Formal Curriculum, Informal Curriculum and Hidden Curriculum.Session 2. Knowledge and Curriculum - The Philosophical CaseThis session will provide source material used to justify the nature and value of a Formal Curriculum, Informal Curriculum and Hidden Curriculum.Session 3  Curriculum, Knowledge and Social ReproductionSession 3 & 4 will explore the sociological perspective of school curriculum. We will discuss the role of education and school curriculum in the reproduction of existing values and social structures. Through locating debates in context, we will ask: does school curriculum contribute to the development of critical thinking? Does Â¿knowledgeÂ¿ or Â¿educationÂ¿ facilitate social mobility?Session 4 Critical Pedagogy and Curriculum for ChangePedagogy is a political project, rather than a technique. The session draws on GirouxÂ¿s work and discusses how education and curriculum may facilitate changes towards a more just society.Session 5. Assessment and AccountabilityThis session will discuss issues related to pupil assessment and the school/teacher accountability in the current global era.Session 6. Curriculum PlanningThis session will provide students an opportunity to apply theories discussed in session 1-5 and explore different curriculum planning models.Seession7: School Curriculum in ScotlandThe next three sessions will explore how a curriculum is developed in response to the topics covered in previous sessions. Session 6 will focus on curriculum development in Scotland.Session 8. Cross Curricular programmes in ScotlandStudents will explore cross curricular programmes at a public organisation in Scotland.Session 9. Teaching Material and Textbook DevelopmentDrawing on the case of textbook development, this session will locate relevant theoretical debates on curriculum in a selected context.Session 10. ConclusionThis Session also will draw conclusions with a discussion of fundamental issues discussed in this course.",

The course is underpinned by the view that Â¿educationÂ¿ does not just occur in educational institutions such as school classrooms and university buildings. Instead it can happen anywhere, at any phase of a personÂ¿s life. The course is also founded on the view that Â¿philosophyÂ¿ is not only an academic discipline, but also a way of life. It is proposed that being philosophical entails careful thought, feeling and action - including thinking for oneself, understanding the perspectives of others and acting for the common good.",
    "course_description": "Questions considered in this course may include:What is the nature of philosophy of education inquiries? What are the possibilities and limitations inherent in a what works view of educational research? How do different epistemologies such as pragmatism, post-positivism and post-structuralism, inform different methods of education research?What is 'education'? How does it differ from teaching, training, socialization, maturation or indoctrination? What should education be for? What educational aims are most justifiable and why? Can these aims be reached and what is the most appropriate way?What does it mean to be an ethical and 'professional' teacher? How might education and teaching be implicated in the 'good' life, if at all? How might examinations and discipline in education interrupt pursuit of the 'good' life?What is 'knowledge' and how is it taught/and or acquired? What types of knowledge are of educational value in different contexts of learning such as classrooms, sports halls, colleges, museums, the outdoors and workplaces?Do educational institutions encourage or hinder the pursuit of democracy, social justice and the understanding of personal and cultural differences? What can be learned from comparing educational traditions in different communities, countries and contexts?By the end of the course students will be able to express their own point of view in respect to these questions, issues and literatures based on a solid line of argumentation.",

    "summary": "This course provides students with an introduction to disciplinary perspectives on the nature of knowledge and the related concept of curriculum.  It draws on the key disciplines of philosophy, policy-studies, psychology and sociology, providing a basis which will enable students to consider curriculum from a critical perspective.",
    "course_description": "In this course students are supported to develop critical understandings of historical and contemporary policies and practices within schools and schooling in national and global contexts through the lenses of philosophy, policy-studies, psychology and sociology.  Students are encouraged to interrogate the concept of curriculum through these disciplinary lenses with a view to developing critical understandings of the political nature of schooling and of teaching and the contested nature of knowledge and its production and reproduction in educational settings.  An exploration of how knowledge is constructed, and how this in turn produces tensions between different conceptualisations of curriculum, will support students' understanding of how such constructions impact on policy and practice.Through site-based learning, students will observe the cultural and pedagogic manifestations of knowledge and curriculum in primary, secondary and alternative settings within the Scottish context and will reflect on the implications for the community of learners and for their own developing professional identities. Comparisons will be made with other national and international contexts, and, where possible, students will draw on international experience.  Through this study, students will deepen their understanding and acknowledgement of teaching as political work, and further their development as activist teachers in a changing world.The course will be delivered in 6 x 1-hour and 7 x 2-hour discursive sessions on University campus which will feed directly into site-based exploratory and observational tasks requiring students to have undertaken reading, observation and other activities in their cluster schools. Students will be supported by tutors, peers and school-based colleagues to engage critically with the GTCS Standard for Provisional Registration throughout the course.Course Content OutlinePart 1Students will be introduced to the concept of curriculum, and the evolution of curricula in local, national and international contexts.Students will be introduced to the contested nature of knowledge, and knowledge production and reproduction (including notions of disciplinarity, interdisciplinarity and multidisciplinarity)Part 2Students will explore disciplinary conceptualisations of knowledge and curriculum from the following applied theoretical disciplines:Philosophical PerspectivesPolicy-studies PerspectivesPsychological PerspectivesSociological PerspectivesPart 3Students will observe and explore the production and reproduction of knowledge and the manifestations of curriculum in school contexts, using Curriculum for Excellence as a case-study.  Students will have the opportunity to discuss comparative curricula in different national contexts, and relate this to learning in the Developing Teacher Professionalism course, particularly in relation to ideas about teachers' professional identities and problematising practice.  Learning from parts 1 and part 2 will be brought together to consider Multi-disciplinarity as a perspective on curriculum, and locate the concept of curriculum within the broader social worlds of school and community.",

    "summary": "The field of digital education is in a stimulating period, with the development of new and contested theoretical perspectives as well as fast moving changes in technologies and practices that are often not subject to critical theorising. This course provides a flexible 'building block' structure supporting students to participate in or create smaller learning activities or experiences, engaging with emergent components of theory and practice in digital education. Individual learning activities within this course will be designed to approximate 5 Credits at Level 11 that accumulate to total 20 Credits at Level 11. It will also be possible for students to engage in single learning activities that are identified as equivalent to 10 or even 20 Credits at Level 11. Students will, therefore, be able to participate in up to four learning activities over the duration of this course.This portfolio of self-selected learning activities will run for the duration of the programme of studies to which this course belongs within the constraints of the pre-requisites specified above and the requirement to have passed 120 Credits to be considered for progression to the dissertation stage of the MSc.Learning activities created for this course will include both activities initiated and led by academic staff from the programme as well as those developed and led by students.This course enables students on the postgraduate programme in Digital Education to engage more fully with a wider range of practices, activities and communities, and will Â¿incentivise the good citizenshipÂ¿ of our students by providing opportunities to gain academic credit through this engagement with emerging technologies and practices in the digital education arena.",
    "course_description": "The proposed course structure operates on two levels: (a) of the overall Â¿courseÂ¿ and (b) in the learning activities themselves.(a) Course structureThe course is structured around a number of activities in each academic year. Each of these activities is designed to approximate 5 Credits at SCQF Level 11 or multipliers of 5 Credits to a total of 20 Credits. The course will take place over a whole year, starting in September for completion by the following August.Therefore, the total Â¿courseÂ¿ provides 20 Credits at SCQF Level 11 through the creation of a post-course digital learning environment constructed in the synthesis of each individualÂ¿s collection of learning activities.(b) Learning activity illustrative structureEach learning activity will be structured differently according to the nature of the activity and the intended learning outcome. Each learning activity would include a specification of the activities to be undertaken, how these will contribute to the achievement of the course Learning Outcomes, the nature of the evidence to be collected and agreement on the nature of the evidence demonstrating attainment of the Learning Outcome(s).",

It will explore ways in which overall course design and the interrelationships of teaching, learning and assessment activities can capitalise on the strengths of students to:-\tfurther develop their potential and interest in the disciplinary area- \thelp them succeed in meeting the course requirements and aspirations-\tassist them in becoming more autonomous and self-aware learners.The other part of the unit will be concerned with clarifying the purposes, pleasures, tensions and key issues in postgraduate research supervision and also with identifying a repertoire of strategies for the achievement of successful outcomes. It will pay particular attention to the processes entailed in supervision and to student perspectives on supervision and will be undergirded by critical review of the research literature. Consideration will be given to the implications of differences in expectations, scale and time frames between Masters and Doctoral dissertations and theses.Running throughout will be a concern to make use of the available research literature (which is growing but still somewhat 'patchy' as regards Masters study) and to indicate how it may contribute to our understanding of, and practical activities in, this important area of academic work.

The course offers two pathways for your project.The first option opens up a language teaching experience. You have ample opportunities for the realization of your proposed project through engaging with local school teachers and pupils. For the second option, your project will focus on promoting Japanese language learning opportunities as part of the course: Japanese Language Beyond University. Such a project can be realized in the form of real-life activities, as well as the creation of virtual products. For example, a team/individual could organize a full-scale outreach event (planning, budgeting, scheduling, promoting, etc) or you could apply your existing knowledge and skills to building a web-based shared space for SLICC students, young Japanese learners and their teachers in Scotland and beyond. For the second pathway, you should discuss your initial idea with the course organiser (Dr Yoko Matsumoto-Sturt Yoko.Matsumoto-Sturt@ed.ac.uk ) before drawing your draft project proposal.Throughout the project, you will regularly reflect on your learning experience through your e-portfolio, providing evidence of learning and progression and demonstrating how you have met the learning outcomes for the course.The steps in undertaking the course are as follows:1) Identify a suitable project for your learning experience, and attend an introductory course workshop2) Write your draft proposal and submit to your course tutor for approval3) Self-direct and manage your own learning experience4) Actively and regularly reflect upon and document your experience, and use this evidence as a basis for writing your self-critical formative Final Reflective Report5) Formatively self-assess and submit your Final Reflective Report for summative assessment by your tutor.",

It includes an overview of (1) the importance of a robust research design to address specific research questions, (2) the principles on which good research designs are based and (3) the strengths and limitations of various research designs. The course will enable students to evaluate the soundness of the research design used in published educational research and understand and interpret the main arguments for employing different designs.",
    "course_description": "Session 1: What is research design? Specification of the research problem and research objectives (John Ravenscroft)The specification of research questions (i.e. what is to be studied) and research design (i.e. how to conduct the study) is an extremely important part of any research project. But where do we start from? And how do we go about finding the right research design for our study? This session will introduce the process of designing a research project and will discuss the different research purposes associated with different research designs.Sessions 2 and 3: Experimental and quasi-experimental design (Sarah McGeown)The goal of experimental design is to establish a causal relation between a \"treatment\" or intervention (e.g. new teaching method or new educational policy) and an outcome of interest. Randomized experiments are frequently considered as the \"gold standard\" for inferring causal effects. However, randomization is not always possible and when it is not possible we may need to rely on quasi-experimental designs for assessing whether a treatment is effective or not. These two sessions will introduce different forms of experimental and quasi-experimental designs, the challenges of collecting these types of data and the types of analyses associated with these designs using examples drawn from the psychological and social science literature.Session 4: Cross-sectional and longitudinal designs: surveys (Cristina Iannelli)Cross-sectional and longitudinal designs are most typically associated with survey data collection methods (e.g. structured interviews and questionnaires). However these types of design can be used in association with qualitative research methods (covered in the next session). In this session we will focus on surveys, in particular on issues of sampling, measurements and methods of data collection. We will cover the use of secondary data in research and discuss issues of primary data collection. Moreover, strengths and limitations of using these types of design will be discussed.Session 5: Qualitative research designs: Interpretative Research (Jane Brown)This session will consider contrasting positions within qualitative research designs, including theory driven research, as well as more inductive approaches. The broad focus however will be to highlight critical stages in the process of undertaking qualitative research. This will include justifications for selecting particular methods, formulating questions for interviews and focus groups and strategies for the analysis of data. On-going attention will be given to the importance of research ethics and the way in which ethical issues can arise over the course of the research enterprise.Sessions 6 and 7: Case-study design (Lorna Hamilton)Case study design is used to study single cases in a detailed and intensive way. In contrast to other research designs (such as cross-sectional designs), case studies are more concerned with revealing the unique features and the complexities of the case under examination than with making generalisation. These sessions will discuss the principles and practice of case study research and will identify the key elements for designing and conducting high quality case studies.Session 8: Cross-country comparative design (Ellen Boeren)In this session we will focus on the importance of conducting comparative research in education. We will examine the use of cross-country comparative research as (1) a framework for global competition by putting peer-pressure on countries versus (2) a framework for conducting self-evaluation of a single country comparing itself to others. The importance of existing datasets collected by major Â¿agenciesÂ¿, such as Eurostat and the OECD, and issues of primary collection of comparative data will be discussed. We will focus on aspects to be taken into account in designing a comparative research study: e.g. by discussing Osborn's (2004) article on comparative research in education which focuses on the need for reflection on conceptual, measurement, linguistic and sampling issues.Session 9: Mixed-methods approach (tutor TBC)A mixed methods research design is a procedure for collecting, analysing, and \"mixing\" both quantitative and qualitative research in a single study to better understand a research problem. This design is implemented when the use of one type of research (qualitative or quantitative) is not considered satisfactory to address the research problem or answer the research questions. This session will examine various ways in which quantitative and qualitative research can be combined: sequentially e.g. 1) follow-up a quantitative study qualitatively to obtain more detailed information or 2) explore an issue qualitatively then develop a quantitative instrument, or concomitantly, i.e. when both methods are used in parallel. It will also discuss the challenges of combining different paradigms, of interpreting and reporting results derived from data collected with different types of research instruments.Session 10: Student presentationsIn this session students will present their research proposal, in particular the rationale for the choices made in regard to research design and data collection/access methods. What are the benefits of the particular design chosen over others? And what are its potential limitations?",

In it, candidates are encouraged to explore links between theory, their own research findings, and the practical realities of their own teaching context. Examples of possible dissertation topics are:- evaluation of teaching materials on paper and/or in observed use- pedagogical description of a specific language area for a specific learner group- case studies of classes or learners- needs analysis for teaching a language for specific purposes- test evaluation and design.Students receive individual guidance in preparing and implementing their research plans.",
    "course_description": "There are a number of possible types of dissertation that may be considered appropriate (e.g. empirical research, desk-based research, research proposal). Students in discussion with their supervisors and with the MSc Dissertation Director should decide the focus and design of the study. Whether empirical or not, the dissertation should demonstrate an understanding of research design, data collection and analysis, presentation and research ethics.Before writing the dissertation and/or collecting any data, students must submit a detailed dissertation proposal and they must obtain ethical approval for their project. If the proposal is satisfactory, a student may begin work on the dissertation. Students will receive support and guidance from their supervisor while developing their proposals and while carrying out the project.In addition students will be able to access school level support in the form of evening lectures and a week of sessions covering different aspects of research design, data collection and data analysis. MSc Language Teaching students will also receive (jointly with MSc TESOL students) research support specific to the field of Language Education.",

    "summary": "The capstone approach to the dissertation increases student agency by providing students a choice in how they demonstrate their ability to critical reflect on, synthesize, and apply knowledge they have gained through the programme through the completion of an independent research-based study. The capstone study provides students with the opportunity to identify, reflect on and explore a topic related to comparative education and/or education and international development that is of interest to them. To ensure that students are able to complete a study that meaningfully prepares them for the next stages of their career, the capstone approach permits students to choose between two options: a traditional dissertation or a placement-based dissertation. During this period, students lead the development, with guidance from their supervisor, of the planning, execution, and write up of an autonomous research project.",
    "course_description": "This programme takes a capstone approach to the dissertation. This flexible approach allows students to better align their study with their future aims. While most students complete a traditional academic dissertation for their capstone study, students may choose to apply for a placement-based dissertation. The latter is a competitive process with space available contingent on the demand of partner organizations. Interested students must meet the academic requirements and apply for placement. Those that are accepted into a placement work, in an unpaid capacity, with a relevant local, regional, or international organisation. It is estimated that 20-30% of students annually will complete a placement-based dissertation.Regardless of the option chosen (traditional or placement-based), students will be expected to complete a dissertation, meeting the same learning outcomes and marked via the same criteria. Given the multi-disciplinary nature of this programme and recognizing the diversity in research approaches and paradigms, dissertations may take different forms, equivalent to 12,000 to 15,000 words. The dissertation is an extended piece of scholarship in which a student is expected to formulate and sustain a substantive piece of independent research in comparative education and/or education and international development. The work is expected to engage critically and analytically with the literature in the field, building upon relevant concepts and theories introduced in the taught elements of the degree and deploying a range of primary and secondary sources as well as appropriate analytic and bibliographic skills. Each student will be allocated a dissertation supervisor by the end of the second semester to advise on and oversee their research progress.",

Its relationship to these awards is specified in the following paragraph.For those candidates whose written work on their first five courses fails to satisfy the standards required for entry to the EdD thesis stage, the EdD Board of Examiners may decide that, rather than produce a paper for a progression board, he or she be given the option of taking ahead an area of independent study of her or his own and of producing an assignment of the length, scope and depth expected on the five taught EdD courses. The topic of this area of independent study to be decided in negotiation with the EdD academic co-ordinator. On satisfactory completion of this assignment and of the the preceding five written assignments required in the first two and a half years of the degree, the EdD Board of Examiners may recommend the award of a Postgraduate Diploma in Educational Research, Policy and Practice. If the candidate has an average mark in these assessments at Masters level, he or she may then choose to complete an appropriate dissertation to Masters' standard, of around, and not exceeding, 15,000 words. On satisfactory completion of this dissertation, the Board of Examiners may recommend the award of the MSc in Educational Research, Policy and Practice.Once a topic for this individually negotiated course has been agreed between the student and the EdD academic co-ordinator, a written contract will be drawn up which will contain the following elements; title; rationale for taking ahead this topic; statement of approach to studying the topic, and rationale for this approach; proposed structure of the assignment; indicative bibliography; timescale and completion date.",

Students will gain experience of undertaking some small data collection and preliminary analysis tasks in order to understand, through primary experience, the practical challenges of undertaking rigorous research.",
    "course_description": "Indicative content- The purposes of educational research and the criteria for judging it.- Purposes and genres of educational texts, paradigms and methods of research.- Taxonomy of social research.- Observation, interviews, ethnography, action research and case studies.- Data collection, management.- Sampling, representativeness, and generalisability and trustworthiness as they apply to qualitative research.Throughout the course the need to develop well-principled grounds for, and practices in, the interpretation of research articles and publications will be fore-grounded. Students will be made aware of the diversity of approaches taken and purposes pursued within the educational literature and the need therefore to remain alert to the fact that a 'one-size' approach might not be appropriate as they read and engage critically with different genres of writing.",

In addition to exploring the nature of qualitative data and the assumptions about social reality which underpin interpretative approaches, the course examines the strengths and weaknesses of the main approaches to data gathering in the qualitative tradition.Central emphasis is given to exploring approaches to, and the practicalities of, data gathering and analysis. A key concern here is to bring participants to connect up general issues and debates in the literature on qualitative research with the day-to-day realities of their own practice. To assist in establishing connections between theoretical frameworks and personal research practice, learning/teaching activities tend to centre on moving from the examination of participants' own experiences in small-scale exercises in data collection and analysis to the consideration of general issues in the methodology literature.Attention is also given to considering the kinds of research claims that interpretative approaches can make.",

This is a major study demanding a high level of individual application and commitment to research and enquiry.  It provides the opportunity to identify, reflect on and explore a topic that meets the requirements, in every respect, for doctoral level work.The Thesis Preparation course runs over one year normally taken in the second and third years of the taught programme. It is important to stress that students will have already undertaken extensive study on topics related to research in education and that this is not a self-contained research methods course.  Building on the preceding taught elements concerned with methodology, methods and research design, it will prepare students to undertake independent research and writing of a doctoral thesis. The course has a strong emphasis on practical aspects of doctoral research but also includes theoretical elements intended to help students develop their research proposals and prepare to undertake the thesis stage.",

The course does this through examination of the changing nature of professionalism in contemporary society; and through consideration of the relationship between global and international developments in professional work and more 'local' UK and Scottish developments, with particular attention to current developments in the management of professional work, including the use of data and performance management, and the trend to integration of professional work across services and disciplines. The course has an orienting function and seeks to help participants use research to 'problematise' their day-to-day professional activity and engage with it in a reflexive manner. It is hoped that participants will enhance their ability to articulate and analyse the notion of professionalism and professional practice (including their own) from a variety of perspectives, and develop interdisciplinary enquiry into professionalism and its contemporary meanings.",

    "summary": "The sport industry is of great social, economic and political significance. Sport is a source of income and expenditure for governments, provides employment for thousands of people and accounts for some of the biggest one-off events on an international scale. The demand for and supply of sport and recreation has increased considerably over the last decade so it is crucial that this industry is managed effectively. This core first year course introduces students to principles of sport management, organisational theory and organisational behaviour.The private (commercial), public and voluntary sectors of the industry are examined to uncover some of the key similarities and differences in this large and diverse sector. Questions of provision and planning are covered. Key management theories are used to critically examine the management of human, physical and financial resources across different sport sectors. It covers principles of management and examines organisational structures, including governance, key elements of organisational behaviour and culture and organisational development within sport and recreation.This course considers the implementation and evaluation of policies associated with sport and recreation management and in the complimentary fields of physical activity and health and wellbeing. It focuses on applying theories to traditional and contemporary sport organisations to illustrate the ways in which sport policy is implemented. Professional practice across several sports sectors will be scrutinised.The course also aims to build key personal study skills that will support academic progress and build professional management capabilities.",

    "course_description": "PART 1 - Exercise PhysiologyExercise Physiology is defined as the branch of the biological sciences that is concerned with the way that the body responds to exercise and training (BASES definition). This part of the course will examine how the different physiological systems respond and adapt to muscular activity. Muscular activity can range from gentle day to day activity to the highest intensity efforts in performance sport. Knowledge and understanding of exercise physiology can help improve health and benefit human performance.  This part of the course will combine class and practical work to examine the function of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and energy systems and how these systems coordinate their functions during exercise and training.PART 2 - Skill AcquisitionSkill Acquisition is the branch of movement science that examines how movement skills are learned (or re-learned after injury or disease) and how coaches, PE teachers and physical therapists can facilitate this process. This is an inter-disciplinary area, where psychology, physiology, anatomy and neurology come together to explain human motor function. To understand motor learning, students will first examine two conflicting theories of how movements are controlled. Students will then look at motor learning and various teaching techniques.  This part of the course will combine class and practical work investigating skill definition and classification, motor coordination, the degrees of freedom problem, constraints-led and information-processing approaches to motor control, motor learning and teaching/coaching of motor skills in applied contexts.Student Learning ExperienceThe course will be taught using a combination of lectures and supporting tutorial/practical sessions.  Students are expected to engage in their students by attending all scheduled sessions, asking questions, taking part in discussions, and being active in practical sessions.  Students will be given formative assessment and feedback designed to enable self-evaluation of progress on the course, which will support the students efforts in their summative assessments, which is where demonstration of achievement of the learning outcomes will be evaluated.This teaching and learning is research-led. Members of academic staff the Institute for Sport, Physical Education and Health Science (ISPEHS) who contribute to this course are all members of one or more of the following research groups hosted by ISPEHS: (1) Physical Activity for Health Research Centre (PAHRC), (2) Edinburgh Sports Research, (3) Human Performance Science and (4) Physical Education Research Forum (PERF).",

An understanding of individual and social influences on motivation will be developed, before considering the factors affecting performance from both an individual and team/group perspective.",
    "course_description": "Part1: Biomechanics:The British Association of Sport & Exercise Sciences (BASES) describes Sport and Exercise Biomechanics as encompassing the area of science concerned \"with the analysis of mechanics of human movement\". In other words it is the science of explaining how and why the human body moves in the way that it does. In sport and exercise that definition is often extended to also consider the interaction between the performer and his or her equipment and environment. Biomechanics is traditionally divided into the areas of kinetics (concerning the analysis of the forces acting on the body) and kinematics (concerning the analysis of the movements of the body).This element of the course will incorporate study of the classical Newtonian Laws with illustrative sporting examples and the basic mechanics that underpin the movement of humans and inanimate objects.  The main areas addressed are linear kinematics, motion with constant & non-constant acceleration, frames of reference & central forces, linear momentum, impact & law restitution, projectiles & fluid dynamics, centre of mass & moments of force, angular motion, as well as work, energy & power.  The course proceeds to develop an awareness and appreciation of both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods within the field of biomechanicsPart 2: Sport PsychologyThe British Association of Sport & Exercise Sciences (BASES) describes psychology as a branch of science that seeks to \"explain how motivations, beliefs and emotions influence our behaviour plus the behaviour of individuals or members of groups in sport and exercise.\" This element of the course aims to provide students with an appreciation of the broad and inter-linked influences which psychological factors may have in sport and exercise settings.Initially this element of the course provides an overview of behaviourist and constructivist learning theories within the context of both physical education & sport & exercise science.  The course proceeds to develop an understanding of the pupil/performer from an individual perspective.  This part of the course will cover the principal theories associated with self-efficacy, anxiety, stress & arousal, as well as focus of attention. The course progresses to consider social factors impacting on group and team performance addressing key theories related to identity, cohesion and collective efficacy..",

    "course_description": "PART 1 - BIOCHEMISTRY OF EXERCISEBiochemistry of Exercise focusses on the molecular aspects of exercise physiology. This involves exploring the biochemical mechanisms involved in the generation of human movement and the responses and adaptations to exercise. Biochemistry of exercise knowledge helps facilitate an understanding of improving human performance through exercise and nutrition. Besides a focus on understanding biochemical processes in relation to sport, this part of the course teaches students about practical techniques used to examine the integrative nature of energy metabolism, muscle contraction and sports nutrition across a wide range of exercise types and intensities.PART 2 - SKILL ACQUISITIONSkill Acquisition is the branch of movement science that examines how movement skills are learned (or re-learned after injury or disease) and how coaches, PE teachers and physical therapists can facilitate this process. This is an inter-disciplinary area, where psychology, physiology, anatomy and neurology come together to explain human motor function. When considering performance of a sports team, there is an added layer of complexity. Team performance is more than the sum of individual performances. Team performance analysis involves specific questions and specific methods of data collection and analysis. Students on this course will work in small groups to conduct a team performance analysis. Each group will address a specific research question through performance analysis. The aim of the analysis is to provide evidence-based advice.This teaching and learning is research-led.

In sport and exercise that definition is often extended to also consider the interaction between the performer and his or her equipment and environment. Biomechanics is traditionally divided into the areas of kinetics (concerning the analysis of the forces acting on the body) and kinematics (concerning the analysis of the movements of the body). The course will progress the learning in year to cover more advanced biomechanical principles and qualitative analysis methods will be used to examine human movement and sporting movements in field and laboratory settings.PART 2 - INFORMATION SKILLSThis part of the course will allow students to explore a range of commonly available computer software and online tools. The courses will provide guidance on how to source scientific information and how to collect, summarize, analyze and present data according to current scientific conventions.

The course will focus on three main sectors covering public, private and voluntary sector organisations and how such organisations have responded to the challenges at local, national, regional or international level.",
    "course_description": "The field of sport management has focused on exploring theories that are originally derived from mainstream management and applying such theories within a sports context. Another way of studying sport management has focused on the re-application of theory grounded or initially generated from a sport context. The course will draw upon theory from both a sports context and also implications of management theory upon sports organisations. Since sports organisations operate in a mixed economy, contemporary issues covering these spheres will be examined and their likely impact on managing sports organisations. Sports organisations do not operate in a vacuum but are influenced by the activities of other non-sport related management practices. Students will be required to identify or acknowledge contemporary issues in society and their implications upon the management of sport. Students will draw upon case studies at local, national and international level to study such phenomena.The students will explore current environment with which sports organisations undertake their operations and examine the drivers of change that are likely to also influence management practice in each sector. A case study approach will be ideal for studying different management practices and application of theory to the different situations. Students will explore how current or emerging political, economic, social, technological, legal or environment developments are likely influence practices in the operation and management of the performance of sports organisations.",

In addition to extending the Year 1 'Sport and Society' course it bridges the level 10 'Sport in Global Context' and 'Sport, Media & Ideology' courses, allowing students to broaden the scope of their socio-cultural knowledge and its application to sports management settings. The focus of this course is to further develop the critical sociological imagination of students in relation to sport and society. We look at underlying assumptions (or meta-theories) about society and consider different approaches for doing research on sport in social contexts. The course has a number of overarching themes further broken down into case studies and/or minor themes and lectures are theoretically underpinned. Each week's session includes a lecture supplemented by debating point/s and/or case study/ies and links to discuss further. This should help connect theory and practice in real life.",

The second half of the course will focus on the psychological consequences of being physically active, such as influence on mood and mental illness. Throughout the course we will draw from recent research and consider application to practice.The course will include sessions such as:Understanding understanding psychological perspectives to physical activityTheoretical perspectives on physical activity behaviourA role for behaviour change techniques in physical activity?Using theory to enhance practice (exercise consultations/motivational interviewing)Physical activity and mental healthStudents will be encouraged to actively participate in interactive discussions and learning activities.

The social and historical issues surrounding sport are theoretically analysed from a range of sociological perspectives. The development of modern sport alongside the emergence of industrial and post-industrial society is discussed. The course will evaluate relevant theoretical approaches in relation to sport.",
    "course_description": "The early weeks focus on the transformation of folk games to modern sport in the context of the Industrialisation Revolution, with specific reference to the dual processes of urbanisation and industrialization. This allows students to contextualise the conditions in which social stratification emerged and to locate the significance of sport in affecting and being affected by these processes. Thus, students are expected to consider sport and wider elements of society as inter-related rather than mutually exclusive. Specifically, students consider the historical influences that Muscular Christianity, Rational Recreation and Amateurism had (and continue to have) on the development of sport in the UK and beyond. Various layers of stratification are interrogated, including class, ethnicity, citizenship and gender. The specific sociological perspectives applied to sport include Functionalist, Marxist, Feminist, Figurationalist and Interactionist. The appropriate methodological issues pertinent to this type of research is embedded throughout the course and students will be encouraged to continually critically reflect on the authenticity and trustworthiness of their and others' work.",

External agencies suitable for hosting a research attachment can include those concerned with performance and excellence in sport through to those more focused on participation and physical activity for health.The nature of this project-based investigation is agreed by the agency, the student and the university. It is in essence the production of an applied consultancy report designed to address an identified problem, issue or knowledge gap. The final report will be a professionally-relevant resource as well as an item of academic assessment.",

A proposal of the work will be discussed with an academic member of staff and agreed by all parties (student, agency & university) before any work commences.

It explores how sport-based interventions mirror the strengths and limitations of alternative education, in particular whether they contribute to or undermine the quest for a more radical and democratic education system.",
    "course_description": "This course draws on relevant theories to critically discusses the structural, ideological and institutional roots of educational disadvantage and the ability of sport-based interventions to overcome them so marginalised pupils can flourish in and beyond school.The role of sport in addressing deep-rooted social problems has increased in prominence as austerity policies have seen the state withdraw from services previously delivered directly.  Some sport organisations now deliver innovative education programmes that bridge the gap between working class pupils and their middle class teachers, while others work in partnership with other agencies to deliver primary and secondary schools. However, within the 'sport for change' agenda at the practical, policy and theoretical level - the contribution of sport to alleviating some pupils' disenfranchisement from mainstream schooling and society is under-examined.  Through extensive critical scholarship on 'education and social justice' and 'sport for change', this course engages students in topical debates about the role of sport in delivering inclusive education and closing the poverty-related attainment gap.Combining critical scholarship, case studies and input from practitioners delivering sporting interventions designed to address educational disadvantage, students will explore whether sport-based interventions provide 'pedagogies of hope' that challenge deficit views of disadvantaged pupils by embracing models of education based on trust, respect and fostering a sense of belonging.",

The relationship between the mass media and modern sport has been an important one since their foundation just over 100 years ago. The media has always helped to construct what is meant by sport. The media has assisted in boundary marking and boundary shifting. The philosophical questions, what is and what is not legitimate in relation to sport have been shaped pragmatically by what appears in the sport sections of newspapers, radio, television broadcasts and more recently with digital, internet and social media. The media continues to play a role in the process by which dominant, residual and emergent sports practices and meanings are defined, legitimised and challenged. Media sport has traditionally provided a structure to people's everyday lives as they tune to regular broadcast times and schedules. Sport has also helped to establish people's sense of calendar time - as the annual round of mediated sports events has been produced. These predictabilities are also subject to change as new media technologies and social practices emerge and become sedimented.The relationship between the institutions of sport and the media should, therefore, form part of the social scientific study of contemporary sport and popular culture.",

It takes place across a continuum stretching from the most basic introduction and participation level at one end, to international elite sports performance at the other. It is a process subject to policy shifts at both the national and local government level. It is provided and serviced by a variety of different agencies including those from the voluntary, commercial and public sectors. The term \"sports development\" is an all-embracing one which includes notions of community development, community recreation, sports-specific development and the development of sporting excellence.",
    "course_description": "This course draws on academic work around the concept of 'sport for good' and 'sport and social capital' to theorise the changing nature and impact of community sport.  It critically examines the role of local government in sport and the increasing part played by sport social enterprises in providing sustainable sporting opportunities.  Key topics covered include:Sport and local governmentModels of community sport developmentSport and sport clubsSport and crime preventionSport and health promotionSport and educational attainmentSporting legacies from major sport eventsSport in schoolsEvaluating sports developmentPartnerships and sports developmentThe course has a programme of one-hour weekly lectures with a supporting programme of two-hour seminars held in smaller tutorial groups.

This is of particular importance in relation to the design, prescription and implementation of evidence-based exercise and training. Acquiring specific physiological knowledge and understanding will enhance the planning and responsible provision of appropriate exercise and training for a range of client groups. The development of laboratory assessment procedures contribute directly to a more effective understanding of the spectrum of physical activity. Consequently, practical familiarity with a range of investigative techniques and equipment is an essential part of the teaching strategy.

Since sport is mainly a service-based industry, resourcing of sport organisations with the right personnel to deliver sports services within a competitive market or filling the gaps of market failures and those resulting from lack of, or scaled-down public sector sport and leisure provision.The students will explore environmental factors, internal and external, to gain an insight to factors that influence strategic decision-making in sport.  The case studies will be drawn from the public, private, and voluntary sports sector organisations to demonstrate the nuances in strategic planning as a result of the operating environment. As a service-dominated industry, the role of human resource management will be explored drawing upon the resource-based view and other theories shaping strategic design.",

It will enable students to make connections between academic theory, professional practice and their professional learning and development. In exploring the complex and dynamic relationship between theory and practice, students will be required to articulate their strengths and weaknesses and to learn how to take responsibility for their professional growth.The course focuses on a critical exploration of the nature of professionalism.  In particular, it considers conceptions of 'the professions' and the assumed desirability of being a member of a profession. With coaches' professional learning increasingly being recognised as a career-long capacity-building endeavour, the course investigates how contemporary conceptualisations of professional learning are moving away from traditional modernist views towards more postmodern perspectives.The course analyses how professional learning is increasingly being informed by thinking from complexity, constructivist and situated perspectives and is beginning to be more actively engage coaches in more open-ended and collaborative learning processes.  Accordingly, the course explores the potential role that coach innovation, creativity, adaptability, pedagogic agility, professional learning communities, networks, distributed leadership, and digital technologies may play in the ongoing evolution of their practice. The course relies on a wide range of literature but specifically involves consideration of ethical issues and critical incidents to develop philosophical understanding of the student's coaching philosophy and practices.In overall terms, the course will address complex ethical and professional issues and requires students to make informed judgments on those issues.

The aim is the look beyond the elite adult or healthy adult performer.The specific populations that will be addressed in the course are not detailed here, as it is plausible that these populations may change fairly rapidly due to changing guidelines, policies, and awareness of the benefits of strength and conditioning principles in different populations.  It is therefore important that the course retains the flexibility to be contemporary year-by-year.The course will be taught in lecture, workshop, and practical format where appropriate, depending on the specific nature of the populations being addressed.",
