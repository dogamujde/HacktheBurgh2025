    "summary": "Accelerators (such as GPUs, FPGAs, matrix coprocessors, etc) have established themselves as a key technology in high-performance computing, particularly in the most powerful current systems, and machine learning training. This course will introduce the general architecture of these devices and how they are built into HPC systems. We will go in depth on the current main techniques for writing high-performance programs using widely deployed accelerators, including debugging, profiling and performance analysis from a single device up to an interconnected cluster. We will discuss techniques for writing and maintaining a program that offers portable performance as well as for adapting an unaccelerated application. We will survey emerging accelerator technologies and discuss the types of problems they may be most effective at tackling and provide some hands-on experience.",
    "course_description": "Accelerators  appear to be here to stay for HPC and AI workloads. This course is mainly a pragmatic course designed to give you a thorough grounding in their architecture and systems design, before progressing to in depth information on how to program these efficiently. We will concentrate on the most widely deployed architecture (GPUs) and programming models (for example CUDA, OpenMP, SYCL), looking at single device parallelism, dealing with shared memory and synchronisation with millions of threads. We will then introduce multi-device parallelism, particularly how to integrate with MPI but mentioning other vendor-specific techniques. We will discuss paradigms for performance portability and practical techniques for adapting an existing application to use accelerated systems. We will introduce less widely deployed but emerging accelerator technologies such as FPGA, matrix coprocessors and ML accelerators. A key aim for the course is for students to be able to make appropriate choices as to which technology and techniques they should adopt for problems they will encounter in the future.",

    "summary": "Modern parallel supercomputers are predominantly programmed using the Message-Passing Interface (MPI) library. Learning the basic MPI syntax and writing medium-scale programs is relatively straightforward, but many issues only arise when tackling large-scale problems on thousands of processes. Typical issues include deadlock, poor scalability or inefficient file IO.There are two basic ways to address these issues. The fundamental MPI calls can be used in more sophisticated ways, which requires an in-depth understanding of the finer details of the MPI standard and its implementation in real libraries. Alternatively, different approaches can be used which employ advanced MPI functionality or which exploit the shared-memory nature of modern multicore compute nodes. Before any correctness or performance issues can be addressed they must first be diagnosed, so knowledge of parallel profiling and debugging is essential.",

It looks at the implementation and optimization of large scale machine learning solutions, considering both training and inference functions, and targeting high performance hardware such as GPUs and TPUs. The course will consider both utilizing common machine learning frameworks and writing standalone implementations.",
    "course_description": "Machine learning occurs at a range of scales, from small scale networks with small datasets or parameter sizes, through to extremely large networks with millions of parameters and datasets of terabyte sizes. Machine learning also has two very distinct phases of operation; training and inference. To enable efficient and quick machine learning exploitation when working with very large networks or very large datasets, powerful computing hardware is required. When using significant amounts of computational hardware, there are challenges in ensuring that applications run efficiently and effectively at scale.This course will provide the practical skills and knowledge require to run machine learning on large-scale HPC systems and hardware to deliver trained models and inference as quickly and efficiently as possible. We will work with a range of common machine learning frameworks, examining how to run them efficiently in parallel and on a range of hardware. We will also utilize parallel programming skills to develop our own implementations of machine learning functionality and augment existing framework solutions, where appropriate. The course will evaluate a range of real-world examples where researchers have scaled machine learning up to very large computers, and learn from the current state of the art for distributed machine learning training and inference.",

    "summary": "If you were given a serial problem, conceptually, how would you go about splitting it up into many different parts that could run concurrently on the latest supercomputers?The good news is that we don't need to reinvent the wheel. Instead there are many different approaches (called parallel patterns) that have been developed by the community and can be used in a variety of situations. These patterns apply equally well regardless of whether our problem is a computational one or data driven.Understanding and being able to apply these patterns also helps getting to grips with existing parallel codes and optimising poorly performing computation and data codes. Whilst the lectures take a top down approach, focusing on the patterns themselves, the practical tutorials give students the opportunity to explore the concepts by implementing pattern based solutions to problems using common HPC technologies.",
    "course_description": "Reusability is a key driver of this module, both reusability of knowledge (the patterns themselves) and parallel codes (via frameworks.) The parallel patterns (known as a pattern language) that we cover are split into two categories. This closest to the problem area (and most abstract) are parallel algorithm strategy patterns and include:- Task Parallelism- Recursive Splitting- Geometric Decomposition- Pipeline- Discrete Event- ActorsThe other category of patterns is closer to the implementation and drives how the programmer should structure their code and data. These are implementation strategy patterns and include:- Master/Worker- Loop Parallelism- Fork/Join- Shared Data and Queues- Active MessagingPatterns are described on an abstract level and we will also discuss enhancements that can be made to improve performance/scalability but at the cost of code complexity. Implementations of these patterns are explored in depth in the tutorials.This module also covers parallel frameworks and how we might write generic implementations of patterns which can be applied to numerous problems. Design principals of frameworks, along with popular HPC libraries will be explored so that students understand both from a design and also implementation perspective how to write generic parallel code.Programming exercises use C and Fortran, with MPI and OpenMP.",

    "summary": "This course has been replaced by EPCC11010 Parallel Design PatternsIf you were given a serial problem, conceptually, how would you go about splitting it up into many different parts that could run concurrently on the latest supercomputers?The good news is that we don't need to reinvent the wheel. Instead there are many different approaches (called parallel patterns) that have been developed by the community and can be used in a variety of situations. These patterns apply equally well regardless of whether our problem is a computational one or data driven.Understanding and being able to apply these patterns also helps getting to grips with existing parallel codes and optimising poorly performing computation and data codes. Whilst the lectures take a top down approach, focusing on the patterns themselves, the practical tutorials give students the opportunity to explore the concepts by implementing pattern based solutions to problems using common HPC technologies.",
    "course_description": "This course has been replaced by EPCC11010 Parallel Design PatternsReusability is a key driver of this module, both reusability of knowledge (the patterns themselves) and parallel codes (via frameworks.) The parallel patterns (known as a pattern language) that we cover are split into two categories. This closest to the problem area (and most abstract) are parallel algorithm strategy patterns and include:- Task Parallelism- Recursive Splitting- Geometric Decomposition- Pipeline- Discrete Event- ActorsThe other category of patterns is closer to the implementation and drives how the programmer should structure their code and data. These are implementation strategy patterns and include:- Master/Worker- Loop Parallelism- Fork/Join- Shared Data and Queues- Active MessagingPatterns are described on an abstract level and we will also discuss enhancements that can be made to improve performance/scalability but at the cost of code complexity. Implementations of these patterns are explored in depth in the tutorials.This module also covers parallel frameworks and how we might write generic implementations of patterns which can be applied to numerous problems. Design principals of frameworks, along with popular HPC libraries will be explored so that students understand both from a design and also implementation perspective how to write generic parallel code.Programming exercises use C and Fortran, with MPI and OpenMP.",

    "summary": "Modern parallel supercomputers are predominantly programmed using the Message-Passing Interface (MPI) library. Learning the basic MPI syntax and writing medium-scale programs is relatively straightforward, but many issues only arise when tackling large-scale problems on thousands of processes. Typical issues include deadlock, poor scalability or inefficient file IO.There are two basic ways to address these issues. The fundamental MPI calls can be used in more sophisticated ways, which requires an in-depth understanding of the finer details of the MPI standard and its implementation in real libraries. Alternatively, different approaches can be used which employ advanced MPI functionality or which exploit the shared-memory nature of modern multicore compute nodes. Before any correctness or performance issues can be addressed they must first be diagnosed, so knowledge of parallel profiling and debugging is essential.",

It is intended to allow students to demonstrate their ability to organise and carry out a substantial investigation into a problem in data science, according to sound scientific principles. The project involves both the application of skills learnt in the past and the acquisition of new skills. The final submission will be expected to be at a level appropriate for an independent researcher and be a good indication of a student's potential to go on to be a productive researcher in a relevant sub-discipline of Data Science.This course is only available to students on the Data Science, Technology and Innovation Online Learning MSc.",

The dissertation marks the final stage of your Masters degree and demonstrates that over the course of the programme you have gained the skills and knowledge required to engage in the formal and rigorous process of research. This process entails, but is not restricted to, identifying a suitable research topic, formulating research objectives, organising/analysing data, organising and reviewing relevant literature, devising an appropriate research methodology, reporting results, drawing conclusions and possibly even making relevant recommendations to the wider research community.The design and conduct of the project will require a high level of commitment and application from the student. The dissertation demonstrates their ability to think scientifically and complete a research report that follows expected academic conventions of style, tone, structuring and referencing. Supervisory support will be supplemented by the detailed project handbook given to all students.The types of activity involved in each project will vary but will include most of the following:- researching the literature and gathering background information- analysing requirements, comparing alternatives and specifying a solution- analysing and extending relevant theory in novel ways- designing and implementing the solution- experimenting with and evaluating the solution- discussing existing results and presenting new research- developing written and oral presentation skillsCommunication with supervisors, including discussion progress and review of draft materials, will be determined by the student and supervisor and is most likely to be carried out by a combination of email and telephony, although all parties are encouraged to use a wiki which will be set up for each student's project.

All parallel operations are performed via calls to some message-passing interface that is entirely responsible for interfacing with the physical communication network.This course uses the de facto standard for message passing, the Message Passing Interface (MPI), which is a library callable from C, C++ or Fortran.

On-campus students should enrol on that course.If you were given a serial problem, conceptually, how would you go about splitting it up into many different parts that could run concurrently on the latest supercomputers?The good news is that we don't need to reinvent the wheel. Instead there are many different approaches (called parallel patterns) that have been developed by the community and can be used in a variety of situations. These patterns apply equally well regardless of whether our problem is a computational one or data driven.Understanding and being able to apply these patterns also helps getting to grips with existing parallel codes and optimising poorly performing computation and data codes. Whilst the lectures take a top down approach, focusing on the patterns themselves, the practical tutorials give students the opportunity to explore the concepts by implementing pattern based solutions to problems using common HPC technologies.",
    "course_description": "Reusability is a key driver of this course, both reusability of knowledge (the patterns themselves) and parallel codes (via frameworks.) The parallel patterns (known as a pattern language) that we cover are split into two categories. This closest to the problem area (and most abstract) are parallel algorithm strategy patterns and include:- Task Parallelism- Recursive Splitting- Geometric Decomposition- Pipeline- Discrete Event- ActorsThe other category of patterns is closer to the implementation and drives how the programmer should structure their code and data. These are implementation strategy patterns and include:- Master/Worker- Loop Parallelism- Fork/Join- Shared Data and Queues- Active MessagingPatterns are described on an abstract level and we will also discuss enhancements that can be made to improve performance/scalability but at the cost of code complexity. Implementations of these patterns are explored in depth in the tutorials.This module also covers parallel frameworks and how we might write generic implementations of patterns which can be applied to numerous problems. Design principals of frameworks, along with popular HPC libraries will be explored so that students understand both from a design and also implementation perspective how to write generic parallel code.Programming exercises use C and Fortran, with MPI and OpenMP.",

However this is one of the more difficult requirements to satisfy:- Issues effecting performance often vary between different hardware and software environments. This requires performance issues to be frequently re-visited as the hardware and software environment changes.- Performance programming requires detailed knowledge of the underlying environment- The design decisions necessary to achieve good performance are often in conflict with other desirable properties of the program.After taking this course students should have a good practical understanding of the general issues and methodologies associated with designing building and refactoring codes to meet performance requirements. In addition they will have an overview of a number of subjects that are important in the understanding of performance on current systems.",

It will have two broad themes, namely Data Management and Data Analytics.Data Science is an emerging field, which is becoming very important both in research, business and industry. The amount of data that is being generated and stored is greater than it has ever been, and this brings both challenges in terms of how you work with the data and - importantly - rewards in terms of new insight gained from analysing the data.The course is practical in the sense that you will have the chance to use R and Python to explore the techniques and ideas described in the course videos.The course will be delivered entirely online, and videos, notes and exercises will be released as the course progresses.This course may not be compatible with some on-campus programmes of study. Students interested in the area may also wish to consider: INFR11176 - Fundamentals of Data Management, INFR11171 - Data Analytics with High Performance Computing",
    "course_description": "Data Science means different things to different people. In this course, we interpret the term fairly broadly, and look at the various aspects of the process of extracting knowledge from data. This course is intended to give a broad introduction to the topic but it will get into sufficient detail to provide practical, hands-on experience of some of the tools and techniques used widely in academic research and in commercial environments.Data Science is a very interdisciplinary field and so the course will expose students to aspects of computer science, software engineering, maths and statistics. It is designed to be accessible whether you come from one of these backgrounds, or whether you come from an applications area (be that in business, science, or elsewhere).The course will have two main (intertwined) strands that will cover \"looking after data\" so that it can be used for analysis and the actual processing of this data to provide insight and answers to specific questions.The course will cover:- Why managing data better matters, and why it's hard- Data formats: structuring data and keeping them useful Metadata: describing data and keeping them useful Research data management planning- Publication and citation of research data- Persistence, preservation and provenance of research data- Licensing, copyright and access rights: some things researchers need to know- Key data analytical techniques such as, classification, optimisation, and unsupervised learning- Key parallel patterns, such as Map Reduce, for implementing analytical techniques- Practical introductions to key Data Science tools and their application to data science problems, e.g., R, Python- Case studies from academia and business",

We will then introduce multi-device parallelism, particularly how to integrate with MPI but mentioning other vendor-specific techniques. We will discuss paradigms for performance portability and practical techniques for adapting an existing application to use accelerated systems. We will introduce less widely deployed but emerging accelerator technologies such as FPGA, matrix coprocessors and ML accelerators. A key aim for the course is for students to be able to make appropriate choices as to which technology and techniques they should adopt for problems they will encounter in the future.",

    "summary": "Modern parallel supercomputers are predominantly programmed using the Message-Passing Interface (MPI) library. Learning the basic MPI syntax and writing medium-scale programs is relatively straightforward, but many issues only arise when tackling large-scale problems on thousands of processes. Typical issues include deadlock, poor scalability or inefficient file IO.There are two basic ways to address these issues. The fundamental MPI calls can be used in more sophisticated ways, which requires an in-depth understanding of the finer details of the MPI standard and its implementation in real libraries. Alternatively, different approaches can be used which employ advanced MPI functionality or which exploit the shared-memory nature of modern multicore compute nodes. Before any correctness or performance issues can be addressed they must first be diagnosed, so knowledge of parallel profiling and debugging is essential.",

It is intended to allow students to demonstrate their ability to organise and carry out a substantial investigation into a problem in data science, according to sound scientific principles. The project involves both the application of skills learnt in the past and the acquisition of new skills. The final submission will be expected to be at a level appropriate for an independent researcher and be a good indication of a student's potential to go on to be a productive researcher in a relevant sub-discipline of Data Science.This course is only available to students on the Data Science, Technology and Innovation Online Learning MSc. It is usually taken over the course of a whole year.",
    "course_description": "The project will be supervised by a member of staff from EPCC and possibly a co-supervisor appropriate to the context of the research (who may be within another part of the University or may be from an appropriate external organisation).In this dissertation course you will be working independently on an extended piece of writing which is original and presents new research within it in the form of a sustained argument. The dissertation marks the final stage of your Masters degree and demonstrates that over the course of the programme you have gained the skills and knowledge required to engage in the formal and rigorous process of research. This process entails, but is not restricted to, identifying a suitable research topic, formulating research objectives, organising/analysing data, organising and reviewing relevant literature, devising an appropriate research methodology, reporting results, drawing conclusions and possibly even making relevant recommendations to the wider research community.The design and conduct of the project will require a high level of commitment and application from the student. The dissertation demonstrates their ability to think scientifically and complete a research report that follows expected academic conventions of style, tone, structuring and referencing. Supervisory support will be supplemented by the detailed project handbook given to all students.The types of activity involved in each project will vary but will include most of the following:- researching the literature and gathering background information- analysing requirements, comparing alternatives and specifying a solution- analysing and extending relevant theory in novel ways- designing and implementing the solution- experimenting with and evaluating the solution- discussing existing results and presenting new research- developing written and oral presentation skillsCommunication with supervisors, including discussion progress and review of draft materials, will be determined by the student and supervisor and is most likely to be carried out by a combination of email and telephony, although all parties are encouraged to use a repository (Git) which will be set up for each student's project. The repository wiki also allows greater version control of submitted work and clearer documentation of discussions/comments than do email or telephone.",

It looks at the implementation and optimization of large scale machine learning solutions, considering both training and inference functions, and targeting high performance hardware such as GPUs and TPUs. The course will consider both utilizing common machine learning frameworks and writing standalone implementations.",
    "course_description": "Machine learning occurs at a range of scales, from small scale networks with small datasets or parameter sizes, through to extremely large networks with millions of parameters and datasets of terabyte sizes. Machine learning also has two very distinct phases of operation; training and inference. To enable efficient and quick machine learning exploitation when working with very large networks or very large datasets, powerful computing hardware is required. When using significant amounts of computational hardware, there are challenges in ensuring that applications run efficiently and effectively at scale.This course will provide the practical skills and knowledge require to run machine learning on large-scale HPC systems and hardware to deliver trained models and inference as quickly and efficiently as possible. We will work with a range of common machine learning frameworks, examining how to run them efficiently in parallel and on a range of hardware. We will also utilize parallel programming skills to develop our own implementations of machine learning functionality and augment existing framework solutions, where appropriate. The course will evaluate a range of real-world examples where researchers have scaled machine learning up to very large computers, and learn from the current state of the art for distributed machine learning training and inference.",

An on-campus version (EPCC11002) runs in Semester 1.Parallel programming by definition involves co-operation between processors to solve a common problem. The programmer has to define the tasks that will be executed by the processors, and also how these tasks exchange data and synchronise with each other.In the message-passing model the tasks are separate processes that communicate by explicitly sending each other messages. All parallel operations are performed via calls to some message-passing library that is entirely responsible for interfacing with the physical communication network.This course uses the de facto standard for message passing, the Message-Passing Interface (MPI), which is a library callable from C, C++ or Fortran. Parallel programs written using MPI can run on almost any system from a multicore laptop to the largest supercomputers in the world.",

On-campus students should, as standard, enrol on that course which runs in Semester 2.If you were given a serial problem, conceptually, how would you go about splitting it up into many different parts that could run concurrently on the latest supercomputers?The good news is that we don't need to reinvent the wheel. Instead there are many different approaches (called parallel patterns) that have been developed by the community and can be used in a variety of situations. These patterns apply equally well regardless of whether our problem is a computational one or data driven.Understanding and being able to apply these patterns also helps getting to grips with existing parallel codes and optimising poorly performing computation and data codes. Whilst the lectures take a top down approach, focusing on the patterns themselves, the practical tutorials give students the opportunity to explore the concepts by implementing pattern based solutions to problems using common HPC technologies.",
    "course_description": "Reusability is a key driver of this module, both reusability of knowledge (the patterns themselves) and parallel codes (via frameworks.) The parallel patterns (known as a pattern language) that we cover are split into two categories. This closest to the problem area (and most abstract) are parallel algorithm strategy patterns and include:- Task Parallelism- Recursive Splitting- Geometric Decomposition- Pipeline- Discrete Event- ActorsThe other category of patterns is closer to the implementation and drives how the programmer should structure their code and data. These are implementation strategy patterns and include:- Master/Worker- Loop Parallelism- Fork/Join- Shared Data and Queues- Active MessagingPatterns are described on an abstract level and we will also discuss enhancements that can be made to improve performance/scalability but at the cost of code complexity. Implementations of these patterns are explored in depth in the tutorials.This module also covers parallel frameworks and how we might write generic implementations of patterns which can be applied to numerous problems. Design principals of frameworks, along with popular HPC libraries will be explored so that students understand both from a design and also implementation perspective how to write generic parallel code.Programming exercises use C or Fortran, with MPI and OpenMP.",

It is designed to be accessible whether you come from one of these backgrounds, or whether you come from an applications area (be that in business, science, or elsewhere).The course will have two main (intertwined) strands that will cover \"looking after data\" so that it can be used for analysis and the actual processing of this data to provide insight and answers to specific questions.The course will cover:- Why managing data better matters, and why it's hard- Data formats: structuring data and keeping them useful Metadata: describing data and keeping them useful Research data management planning- Publication and citation of research data- Persistence, preservation and provenance of research data- Licensing, copyright and access rights: some things researchers need to know- Key data analytical techniques such as, classification, optimisation, and unsupervised learning- Key parallel patterns, such as Map Reduce, for implementing analytical techniques- Practical introductions to key Data Science tools and their application to data science problems, e.g., R, Python- Case studies from academia and business",

In industry, sophisticated computer models are integral to the development of products such as jet engines, wind turbines and new drugs.Modern supercomputers are parallel computers, gaining their power from many thousands of individual processors. Developing software to run on these systems requires using new parallel programming techniques.The course will cover all the fundamental concepts that underpin modern HPC. The course is practical in the sense that you will explore these topics by running parallel programs on real HPC systems such as an UK national Tier-2 system, Cirrus.The course will be delivered entirely online, and videos, notes and exercises will be released as the course progresses.",

The same techniques can also be applied to smaller systems such as multi-core desktops, graphics processors and computing clusters.The course has three main themes:1) Hardware, Architectures, System SoftwareHow are HPC systems constructed and what impact do components play in performance of applications? What system software is used on HPC systems and how does it impact the user experience?2) Parallel ProgrammingWhat are the key parallel programming paradigms in use on modern HPC systems and how are they implemented and made available to users in practice? How do you measure parallel performance and scaling? How do you debug and profile parallel applications?3) Applications on HPC systemsWhat types of applications run on modern HPC systems and what are the limiting factors to scaling and performance in these areas? What does the future hold for HPC applications - how will they run on next generation HPC systems.",

    "summary": "Modern parallel supercomputers are predominantly programmed using the Message-Passing Interface (MPI) library. Learning the basic MPI syntax and writing medium-scale programs is relatively straightforward, but many issues only arise when tackling large-scale problems on thousands of processes. Typical issues include deadlock, poor scalability or inefficient file IO.There are two basic ways to address these issues. The fundamental MPI calls can be used in more sophisticated ways, which requires an in-depth understanding of the finer details of the MPI standard and its implementation in real libraries. Alternatively, different approaches can be used which employ advanced MPI functionality or which exploit the shared-memory nature of modern multicore compute nodes. Before any correctness or performance issues can be addressed they must first be diagnosed, so knowledge of parallel profiling and debugging is essential.",

    "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) provides many opportunities to improve private and public life. Discovering patterns and structures in large troves of data in an automated manner is a core component of data science, and currently drives applications in diverse areas such as computational biology, law and finance. However, such a highly positive impact is coupled with significant challenges: how do we understand the decisions suggested by these systems in order that we can trust them? In this course, we focus specifically on data driven methods - machine learning (ML) and pattern recognition models in particular - so as to survey and distill the results and observations from the literature. The purpose of this course is to provide and explore the principles and practice of enabling explainability in machine learning models. The course builds a narrative around a putative data scientist, and discusses how she might go about explaining her models by asking the right questions.",
    "course_description": "Machine learning models are increasingly deployed in a wide range of businesses. However, with the increasing prevalence and complexity of methods, business stakeholders may have concerns about the drawbacks of models, data-specific biases, and so on. Analogously, data science practitioners are often not aware about approaches emerging from the academic literature, or may struggle to appreciate the differences between different methods, so end up using industry standards such as SHAP. Here, we aim to help industry practitioners understand the field of explainable machine learning better and apply the right tools.From an organization viewpoint, after motivating the area broadly, we turn to technical insights, which includes three frameworks: a taxonomic framework provides an overview of explainable ML, and the other two frameworks further study so-called transparent models vs opaque models in that taxonomy. The latter then requires model specific or model agnostic post-hoc explainability approaches, which have their individual limitations and strengths that are also discussed. We also briefly reflect on deep learning models, and conclude with a discussion about future research directions. In terms of exercises, we will focus on 6 popular techniques and try to understand how to use these explainability techniques with coding problems for publicly available datasets.Intermediate assignments will be evaluated against workbooks that make use of the post hoc explainability methods discussed in the course. For final assessment, participants can work on a project of their choice, including their own data and demonstrate the ability to mix and match different methods towards a problem statement.As we expect to use the publicly available Google colab books or similar, no specific hardware is required. Most tools will run in a web-browser.Individuals will work on their own projects, alone or in groups, and will go through all the stages of the exploration of posthoc explainability, in alignment with the learning outcomes; explore data and make initial findings, critique the tools and list shortcomings and possible future features and present an analysis.The course has 11 lectures, each targeting a set of principles and/or technique, and which are organized as follows. Topics are provided as pre-recorded lectures, and following a flipped classroom model, during the interaction/live sessions there will be a discussion about the content and insights from the pre-recorded lectures. Participants will have an opportunity to debate conceptual aspects during these live sessions. In addition, there will be tutorial sessions that will give participants an opportunity to engage in coding exercises and raise practical issues about the corresponding topics.Lectures and topics:1. Preface to ML: 1 hour2. Preface to XAI: concepts, ideas, discussions drawnfrom the literature 1 hour3. Frameworks: 1 hour4. 6 XAI techniques: 6 hours (currently: SHAP, InTrees,Anchors, PDP, Counterfactuals, Deletion diagnostics)5. Advanced techniques and concepts: 30 mins6. Deep learning strategies, future research directions: 30mins**This is an introductory Masters-level course. It provides foundational skills in terms of an overview of the subject of explainability in machine learning thus, we expect a basic understanding of machine learning. It is also assumed that participants of the course have some prior programming experience in Python. For more details, see the \"Other requirements\" box below.",

This course is about the principled application of machine learning techniques to extracting information from data. The main area that will be discussed is supervised learning, which is concerned with learning to predict an output, given inputs. A second area of study is unsupervised learning, where we wish to discover the structure in a set of patterns, i.e. there is no output \"teacher signal\". The primary aim is to provide the student with a set of practical tools that can be applied to solve real - world problems in machine learning, coupled with an appropriate, principled approach to formulating a solution.This distance-based course is aligned with the on-campus Introductory Applied Machine Learning course (INFR11205), which uses a flipped classroom delivery approach.

All parallel operations are performed via calls to some message-passing interface that is entirely responsible for interfacing with the physical communication network.This course uses the de facto standard for message passing, the Message Passing Interface (MPI), which is a library callable from C, C++ or Fortran.

    "summary": "*This course replaces the course 'Natural Computing INFR11165' from 2019/20**Please note that this is an online learning course, aimed at students on the DSTI or Informatics distance learning programmes*.This module teaches you about bio-inspired algorithms for optimisation and search problems. The algorithms are based on simulated evolution (including Genetic algorithms and Genetic programming), particle swarm optimisation, ant colony optimisation as well as systems made of membranes or biochemical reactions among molecules. These techniques are useful for searching very large spaces. For example, they can be used to search large parameter spaces in engineering design and spaces of possible schedules in scheduling. However, they can also be used to search for rules and rule sets, for data mining, for good feed-forward or recurrent neural nets and so on. The idea of evolving, rather than designing, algorithms and controllers is especially appealing in AI. In a similar way it is tempting to use the intrinsic dynamics of real systems consisting e.g. of quadrillions of molecules to perform computations for us. The course includes technical discussions about the applicability and a number of practical applications of the algorithms.In this module, students will learn about- The practicalities of natural computing methods: How to design algorithms for particular classes of problems.- Some of the underlying theory: How such algorithms work and what is provable about them.- Issues of experimental design: How to decide whether an metaheuristic algorithm works well.- Current commercial applications.- Current research directions.",
    "course_description": "The lectures will cover the following subjects:- Computational aspects of animal behaviour and of biological, chemical or physical systems- Genetic and Evolutionary Algorithms: Selection, recombination and mutation, fitness and objective functions- Swarm intelligence, particle swarms, differential evolution, robot swarms- Theory: the schema theorem and its flaws; convergence, statistical mechanics approaches- Comparisons among various metaheuristic algorithms, No-Free-Lunch theorems- Hybrid, hyperheuristic, and memetic algorithms- Multi-objective optimisation- Genetic programming- Applications such as engineering optimisation; scheduling; data-mining; neural net design- Experimental issues: Design and analysis of sets of experimentsRelevant QAA Computing Curriculum Sections: Artificial Intelligence, Data Structures and Algorithms, Simulation and Modelling",

On-campus students should enrol on that course.If you were given a serial problem, conceptually, how would you go about splitting it up into many different parts that could run concurrently on the latest supercomputers?The good news is that we don't need to reinvent the wheel. Instead there are many different approaches (called parallel patterns) that have been developed by the community and can be used in a variety of situations. These patterns apply equally well regardless of whether our problem is a computational one or data driven.Understanding and being able to apply these patterns also helps getting to grips with existing parallel codes and optimising poorly performing computation and data codes. Whilst the lectures take a top down approach, focusing on the patterns themselves, the practical tutorials give students the opportunity to explore the concepts by implementing pattern based solutions to problems using common HPC technologies.",
    "course_description": "Reusability is a key driver of this course, both reusability of knowledge (the patterns themselves) and parallel codes (via frameworks.) The parallel patterns (known as a pattern language) that we cover are split into two categories. This closest to the problem area (and most abstract) are parallel algorithm strategy patterns and include:- Task Parallelism- Recursive Splitting- Geometric Decomposition- Pipeline- Discrete Event- ActorsThe other category of patterns is closer to the implementation and drives how the programmer should structure their code and data. These are implementation strategy patterns and include:- Master/Worker- Loop Parallelism- Fork/Join- Shared Data and Queues- Active MessagingPatterns are described on an abstract level and we will also discuss enhancements that can be made to improve performance/scalability but at the cost of code complexity. Implementations of these patterns are explored in depth in the tutorials.This module also covers parallel frameworks and how we might write generic implementations of patterns which can be applied to numerous problems. Design principals of frameworks, along with popular HPC libraries will be explored so that students understand both from a design and also implementation perspective how to write generic parallel code.Programming exercises use C and Fortran, with MPI and OpenMP.",

Practical aspects of these will use a Python-based ecosystem.1. Data wrangling and exploratory data analysis- Working with tabular data- Descriptive statistics and visualisation- Linear regression and correlation- Clustering2. Supervised machine learning- Classification- More on linear regression; logistic regression- Generalization and regularization3. Statistical inference- Randomness, simulation and sampling- Confidence intervals, law of large numbers- Randomized studies, hypothesis testingInterleaved with these topics will be topics focusing on real-world implications (often using case studies), critical thinking, working and writing skills. These may be introduced in lecture but will often include a workshop discussion and/or peer review of written work. Indicative topics include:A. Implications:- Where does data come from? (Sample bias, data licensing and privacy issues)- Visualisation: misleading plots, accessible design- Machine learning: algorithmic bias and discriminationB.

    "course_description": "As students enter this course they team up in groups of 3-4 to develop a small-scale software system from scratch using an iterative waterfall process. Over the course of the semester, they consider an incomplete specification to derive and analyse requirements, design their solution from a static and dynamic perspective using UML diagrams, construct and test their solution in Java. There is room for interpretation, creativity, and some of the requirements change along the way. Moreover, there are technical, professional and ethical issues surrounding the problem at hand, on which students will need to reflect.Included in the experience will be use of industry standard tools for software development (integrated development environments, version control, issue tracking), and key elements of modern development practice, such as code review, peer review, and pair programming.As students engage in this practical work, the course will contextualise it against the broader themes, both of large-scale software engineering and its academic literature, and of today's urgent professional issues: the legal, ethical and social context in which software and its authors exist. Guest lecturers will speak on technical topics, but also on topics such as privacy, security, equality, democracy and intellectual property - some of which will have a direct impact on students' practical work.",

The course illustrates the importance of (i) using a smart representation of knowledge such that it is conducive to efficient reasoning, and (ii) the need for exploiting task constraints for intelligent search and planning. The notion of representing action, space and time is formalized in the context of agents capable of sensing the environment and taking actions that affect the current state. There is also a strong emphasis on the ability to deal with uncertain data in real world scenarios and hence, the planning and reasoning methods are extended to include inference in probabilistic domains.",

As a participating student, undertaking a SLICC will enable students to create a unique learning experience, while demonstrating their learning and academic achievement against defined learning outcomes.This level 8 course will require students to demonstrate the development of their skills and understanding in terms of critical analysis, application, reflection, recognising and developing your skills and mindsets, and evaluation within a defined context of their learning experience. This course will also enable students to demonstrate your ability to exercise autonomy and initiative at a professional level in practice and/or in a subject/discipline (or other approved) area.",
    "course_description": "The Informatics Experiential Learning requires students to propose, develop and manage a unique learning experience that will enable the student to evidence how they have achieved the learning outcomes of the course.The student's self-designed learning experience is required to adhere to a defined structure that supports and enables the student to self-direct and manage their own learning experience. Within this structure however, students have limitless possibilities regarding the topic or theme, content of study and nature of their experience, provided their proposal is academically feasible and is approved by the course organiser or tutor.Informatics Experiential Learning, for example, may be based upon a particular extra-curricular learning opportunity such as an internship, work experience, pro-bono activity, community engagement, volunteering, or study-abroad and may also focus on a theme of personal and/or professional interest such as sustainability, social responsibility, equality and cultural diversity, or a disciplinary or interdisciplinary-based research theme.The steps in undertaking this course are as follows:1. Visit the IEL Information Page (https://uoe.sharepoint.com/sites/IEL2) to help you identify a suitable opportunity within which to undertake your learning experience. (Currently only pre-approved projects listed on the IEL Information Page are permitted.)2. Follow the application procedure given on the IEL Information Page for the project / opportunity you are interested. Your application must be approved by the IEL tutor before you can register for this course3. Self-direct and manage your own learning experience4. Actively and regularly reflect upon and document your experience with evidence and use that as a basis for writing your self-critical 'Interim Reflective Report', then your 'Final Reflective Report'5. Formatively self-assess and submit your 'Final Reflective Report' for summative assessment by your tutor.The steps identified above each require a significant amount of thought and input and will ultimately form part of a 'time-based' e-portfolio of evidence which will be used in the assessment of the Informatics Experiential Learning course.Undertaking Informatics Experiential Learning, students will not only develop the content of their learning experience but also produce an agreed portfolio of outputs where they must evidence what they have learned and, importantly, where they demonstrate how they met the learning outcomes for the course.",

The learning outcomes are flexible to provide students with autonomy. With guidance from your assigned academic tutor, this flexibility of choice enables students, in the context of their own chosen experience, to focus on their own particular 'skills' and 'mindset'. Students can select the specific attributes that they consider are the most important to reflect upon, looking into their current and future professional and personal aims and career aspirations. Typically students will learn to:- Setup realistic deadlines, keep to those deadlines and have contingency plans- Communicate ideas in an interdisciplinary team with various backgrounds and knowledge levels- Work independently and with guidance provided from more experienced members",

The teaching environment for the EIP course will be in-person, face-to-face, with a core teaching facilitator who organises the weekly lesson plans, the guest lecturers, and who serves as a facilitator and introducer of weekly learning. Teaching will be delivered in a way that enables students to build on their entrepreneurial knowledge each week through formal and informal interactions with the course organiser.",
    "course_description": "The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Project covers three levels of cognitive domains (Knowledge, Comprehension, and Application): it exposes the enrolled students to entrepreneurial knowledge, and then teaches them how to explain and represent their new knowledge through applying it to constructing a solution to a problem that they have identified. Students will be assessed on their ability to develop and execute a semester-long project and team management plan. On a weekly basis, each individual in the team will be required to reflect on/provide a personal perspective of the effectiveness of their teamwork. Like a real-life business with co-founders, the EIP course requires students face and address challenges as a team.Student teams will be provided with formative assessment throughout the semester on the basis of their contributions to weekly reflective exercises, which evaluate their progress on collaboratively planning for and presenting a group business plan as their final project. All students will be required to attend weekly business planning workshops, which will guide students on how to research for and populate sections of their business plans that will be assessed as a summative portfolio of each team's collaborative learning journey throughout the semester. Weekly class attendance and effective team work are both essential in order for students to get a good grade for EIP.The EIP course provides students with an opportunity to define and engage with an entrepreneurial project that they can continue pursue beyond the 1-semester of the EIP course delivery.The course organiser of EIP will provide students with a guided learning pathway, which enables the teaching team (organiser and tutors) to get to know the individual teams 'intimately' through the semester, so as to offer them individualised/team-specific feedback within the context of the larger learning outcomes and with regard to the components of the business plan that are assessed for a final team and individual grade.",

The project involves applying and combining material from several courses to complete a complex design and implementation task. At the end of course each group demonstrates its implemented system and gives a formal presentation to an audience of the students, supervisors, and visitors from industry.",
    "course_description": "During this project students work in groups of about ten on the design and implementation of a complete system to solve some practical and useful problem. Each group can choose the specific task within the broad theme of 'assistive robotics',  i.e., the system should be envisioned as able to perform an autonomous task in the real world, and will develop a demonstrator (which may exist in simulation or hardware). Recent examples of projects include: a robot shopping trolley for the visually impaired; smart switches to convert any household switch to be remote controlled with an app; a robot chess opponent; robot rubbish collection and sorting; etc.The aim is to produce a system that provides a convincing demonstration of a potential product, suitable for presentation to a client/investor. It should thus include significant development of supporting software, user interfaces, and either real or physical simulation mock-ups. These should be integrated into a complete working system, showing that core problems have been solved. There will be support for hardware construction as required, through a dedicated lab space with a wide range of equipment available, and/or through commissioning the technical support team, with a budget for equipment and support time available to each group.Online workshops and dedicated office hours from domain experts will be available to advise and guide all aspects of the task, such as time and task management, hardware design, software libraries, interfaces, etc. Each group is assigned a mentor. The mentor's task is to advise and provide feedback on the progress of the group during the project but not to provide technical support. Groups meet with their mentors at least once a week. They also meet amongst themselves more frequently to plan and coordinate their activities. Specific demonstration points are timetabled regularly during the semester when progress will be assessed and feedback provided.Towards the end of the semester, a day is set aside for groups to demonstrate their implemented system and to give a formal presentation of it to an audience of the students, mentors, and visitors from industry.Relevant QAA Computing Curriculum Sections: Computer Based Systems, Systems Analysis and Design",

It is one of the oldest subfields of Artificial Intelligence, originating in the mid-1950s when it was first used to reason about propositional logic. Since then, it has been applied to domains ranging from the formalisation of advanced mathematics to the formal verification of software and hardware systems.In this course, we take an interactive approach to automated reasoning and explore how the proof assistant Isabelle can work with the user to establish mathematical correctness via a formal but human-friendly proof language. This provides a way of turning logic based reasoning into a form of programming that can then be used (among other things) to reason about problems in mathematics, e.g. probability theory and multivariate analysis, and industrially-relevant areas e.g. the safety of autonomous systems.",
    "course_description": "The course starts with an introduction to higher order logic, theorem provers and, more specifically, Isabelle / HOL. This will set the context for the rest of the course in which Isabelle will be the framework for getting hands-on experience about the application of various theoretical concepts.Through the lectures and weekly exercises that incorporate practical aspects the students will gain the skills needed to get started with Isabelle and progress to more complex concepts involving both representation and reasoning.The second part will look at representation/modelling of concepts in (higher order) logic in details. Axiomatic versus conservative extensions of theories will be covered and mechanisms such as Isabelle locales will be introduced and used. Recursive definitions and inductive notions will be covered too.The third part of the course will focus on fundamental notions such as unification and rewriting, within both a first and higher order context. It will look at notions such as termination and use Isabelle's simplifier as the tool for understanding many of the concepts. It will also look at the interplay between (fully) automatic and interactive proofs.The fourth part will introduce declarative/structured proofs and using the Isar language of Isabelle show how proofs resembling pencil and paper ones can be formalized.Finally the various strands will be brought together through the discussion of a non-trivial case study. This may involve either formalized mathematics (e.g. looking at a geometric theory) or a formal verification example.The assignment will be a combination of basic to intermediate representation and reasoning in Isabelle (up to 40%), more advanced proof tackling one particular domain or example (up to 40%) and a final part which, if completed successfully, will clearly demonstrate that the student has a good grasp of the challenges that advanced interactive theorem proving entails.",

    "summary": "This course aims to introduce students to the basic concepts and methodology needed to implement and analyse computational models of cognition. It considers the fundamental issues of using a computational approach to explore and model cognition. In particular, we explore the way that computational models relate to, are tested against, and illuminate psychological theories and data.The course will introduce both symbolic and subsymbolic modelling methodologies, and provide practical experience with implementing models. The symbolic part will focus on cognitive architectures,while the subsymbolic part will introduce probabilistic models.",
    "course_description": "- An introduction/review of the idea of computational approaches to studying cognition; the mind as information-processing system; Marr's levels of analysis (computational, algorithmic, implementation).- The general motivations underlying the computational modelling of cognition, and different kinds of questions that can be answered (e.g., why do cognitive processes behave as they do, or what algorithms might be used to carry out this behaviour? What kinds of information are used, or how is this information processed/integrated over time?)- Mechanistic/algorithmic approaches and issues addressed by these approaches: parallel versus serial processing, flow of information, timing effects.- Rational/probabilistic approaches and issues addressed by these approaches: adaptation to the environment, behaviour under uncertainty, learning, timing effects.- General issues: top-down versus bottom-up processing, online processing, integration of multiple sources of information.- Methodology and issues in the development and evaluation of cognitive models: Which psychological data are relevant? What predictions are made by a model? How could these be tested?- Modelling techniques: in the assignments, students will experiment with both symbolic (rulebased) and subsymbolic (probabilistic) cognitive models.- Example models: in a number of areas we will look at the theories proposed and different ways of modelling them. Areas discussed will include several of the following: language processing, reasoning, memory, high-level vision, categorization. Specific models will be introduced and analysed with regard to relevant psychological data.",

    "summary": "In this course you will learn how to design a computer and understand the performance characteristics of computers. You will first acquire a working knowledge of digital design, through the Verilog Hardware Description Language, along with a good theoretical grounding in the design of the key components of a microprocessor. You will have an opportunity to learn, both theoretically and practically, how the Quantitative Approach to computer architecture enables computer architects to analyse and optimize microprocessors to maximize performance. Along the way you will design real hardware, and later in the course you will apply your recently-acquired knowledge of quantitative computer architecture to analyse a simulated system and optimize its performance.",
    "course_description": "The aim of this course is to give students a comparatively deep understanding of computer architecture, to an intermediate level, together with a solid understanding of techniques used to design the logical building blocks from which a computer is constructed. We consider an intermediate level in computer architecture to extend up to the point where students have a good understanding of instruction set architecture, single-issue in-order pipelined execution of instructions, superscalar out-of-order execution, and the memory hierarchies required by those processors. Within a processor, we explore the principles and practice of arithmetic and logic unit design, of the caches from which memory hierarchies are constructed, and the memory and logic gate technologies from which computers are constructed. Throughout the course, there is a strong emphasis on the Quantitative Approach to computer architecture; this informs not only the theoretical topics but also the practical assignments, which always embody some element of the quantitative approach.The philosophy of this course is that learning about computer architecture is particularly effective if reinforced by implementing key aspects of processor design, in real hardware when feasible, but also at higher levels of abstraction using simulated systems. This approach has been used very effectively in the previous Computer Design and Computer Architecture courses, and feedback often cites the value placed on the lab exercises by students.Outline ContentsFundamentalsReview of logic design and implementation technologies; from simple combinational logic to state machines for sequential circuits; logic design using Verilog and introduction to FPGAs.Register Transfer Level design principles; registers, clocks, timing budgets, setup and hold margins, clock skew, clock-domain crossing and synchronization, metastability.Quantitative computer architecture; performance evaluation methods and metrics, principles of high-performance design.Processor ArchitectureInstruction Set Architecture (ISA) design; instruction set classes, registers, memory addressing.

Paradoxically, they are among the most permanent features of the computing landscape (Fortran, for example, is still widely used 60 years since its invention), and among the most energetic and innovative, with new programming languages introduced every few months, often aiming to simplify Web programming, parallel, or distributed computing.Although few computer scientists will ever design a new, general-purpose language like Java or C++, all computer scientists need the ability to learn new languages quickly, recognise and use (or avoid misusing) common language features, and even design new domain-specific languages for restricted problem domains. The design of programming languages involves many subtle choices and tradeoffs among performance, convenience, and elegance.This course covers the essential programming structures for managing data and controlling computation, as well as abstractions that facilitate decomposing large systems into modules. The course also covers pragmatics of programming languages, including abstract syntax, interpretation and domain-specific language implementation. You will not learn how to use any one language, but instead you will learn the basic elements you need to understand the next 700 programming languages, or even design your own.",

    "summary": "This course covers some of the linguistic and algorithmic foundations of natural language processing (NLP). It builds on algorithmic and data science concepts developed in second year courses, applying these to NLP problems.  It also equips students for more advanced NLP courses in year 4. The course is strongly empirical, using corpus data to illustrate both core linguistic concepts and algorithms, including language modelling, part of speech tagging, syntactic processing, the syntax-semantics interface, and aspects of semantic and pragmatic processing. The theoretical study of linguistic concepts and the application of algorithms to corpora in the empirical analysis of those concepts will be interleaved throughout the course.",
    "course_description": "An indicative list of topics to be covered include:1. Lexicon and lexical processing:* morphology* language modeling* hidden Markov Models and associated algorithms* part of speech tagging (e.g., for a language other than English) to illustrate HMMs* smoothing* text classification2. Syntax and syntactic processing:* the Chomsky hierarchy* syntactic concepts: constituency (and tests for it), subcategorization, bounded and unbounded dependencies, feature representations* context-free grammars* lexicalized grammar formalisms (e.g., dependency grammar)* chart parsing and dependency parsing (eg, shift-reduce parsing)* treebanks: lexicalized grammars and corpus annotation* statistical parsing3. Semantics and semantic processing:* word senses: regular polysemy and the structured lexicon; distributional models; word embeddings (including biases found)* compositionality, constructing a formal semantic representation from a (disambiguated) sentential syntactic analysis.* predicate argument structure* word sense disambiguation* semantic role labelling* pragmatic phenomena in discourse and dialogue, including anaphora, presuppositions, implicatures and coherence relations.* labelled corpora addressing word senses (e.g., Brown), semantic roles (e.g., Propbank, SemCor), discourse information (e.g., PDTB, STAC, RST Treebank).4. Data and evaluation (interspersed throughout other topics):* cross-linguistic similarities and differences* commonly used datasets* annotation methods and issues (e.g., crowdsourcing, inter-annotator agreement)* evaluation methods and issues (e.g., standard metrics, baselines)* effects of biases in data",

As a participating student, undertaking a SLICC will enable students to create a unique learning experience, while demonstrating their learning and academic achievement against defined learning outcomes.This level 10 course will require students to demonstrate the development of their skills and understanding in terms of critical analysis, application, reflection, recognising and developing your skills and mindsets, and evaluation within a defined context of their learning experience. This course will also enable students to demonstrate your ability to exercise autonomy and initiative at a professional level in practice and/or in a subject/discipline (or other approved) area.This course will require students to specifically demonstrate learning in the context of the higher order skills such as analysis, evaluation, and creation and demonstration of meta-cognitive development.It is expected that students taking this course would not only engage in the EUFS team effort, but take on additional responsibility in team management and organisation.",
    "course_description": "The Informatics Experiential Learning requires students to propose, develop and manage a unique learning experience that will enable the student to evidence how they have achieved the learning outcomes of the course.The student's self-designed learning experience is required to adhere to a defined structure that supports and enables the student to self-direct and manage their own learning experience. Within this structure however, students have limitless possibilities regarding the topic or theme, content of study and nature of their experience, provided their proposal is academically feasible and is approved by the course organiser or tutor.Informatics Experiential Learning, for example, may be based upon a particular extra-curricular learning opportunity such as an internship, work experience, pro-bono activity, community engagement, volunteering, or study-abroad and may also focus on a theme of personal and/or professional interest such as sustainability, social responsibility, equality and cultural diversity, or a disciplinary or interdisciplinary-based research theme.The steps in undertaking this course are as follows:1. Identify a suitable opportunity within which to undertake your learning experience, and attend an introductory Informatics Experiential Learning workshop2. Write your draft proposal and submit to your tutor/advisor for approval3. Self-direct and manage your own learning experience4. Actively and regularly reflect upon and document your experience with evidence and use that as a basis for writing your self-critical 'Interim Reflective Report', then your 'Final Reflective Report'5. Formatively self-assess and submit your 'Final Reflective Report' for summative assessment by your tutor.The steps identified above each require a significant amount of thought and input and will ultimately form part of a 'time-based' e-portfolio of evidence which will be used in the assessment of the Informatics Experiential Learning course.Undertaking Informatics Experiential Learning, students will not only develop the content of their learning experience but also produce an agreed portfolio of outputs where they must evidence what they have learned and, importantly, where they demonstrate how they met the learning outcomes for the course.",

The learning outcomes are flexible to provide students with autonomy. With guidance from your assigned academic tutor, this flexibility of choice enables students, in the context of their own chosen experience, to focus on their own particular 'skills' and 'mindset'. Students can select the specific attributes that they consider are the most important to reflect upon, looking into their current and future professional and personal aims and career aspirations. Typically students will learn to:- Setup realistic deadlines, manage to those deadlines and develop contingency plans- Communicate ideas in an interdisciplinary team with various backgrounds and knowledge levels- Work independently and provide guidance to less experienced members",

This course provides a general understanding of related concepts such as sensing (e.g., visual perception), state estimation (e.g., localisation and mapping) and sequential decision making. The emphasis is on algorithms for probabilistic state estimation, reasoning, control, and coordination, as opposed to electromechanical systems design. Practically useful tools and simulators for developing real robotic systems will also be covered in this course.At the end of the course, students will develop sufficient skills in the analysis of perception, state estimation, navigation, and decision making algorithms for mobile robots.",
    "course_description": "Delivery Method:The course will be delivered through a combination of: (1) live lectures; (2) tutorials; and (3) (optional) online discussion forum. (it originally also said practical labs)Content/Syllabus:This is an introductory course in robotics. We will primarily explore a probabilistic treatment of the associated challenges, while also briefly discussing other formulations (e.g., based on logics, hybrid methods). The specific methods discussed may vary depending on how we make progress but the course will most likely focus on the following topics:- Introduction to probabilistic robotics; refresher of basic mathematical concepts from probability theory.- Probabilistic state estimation and Bayes filters.- Kalman filters and extensions: EKF, UKF; Particle filters.- Sensor models and motion models.- Basic control theory: open-loop and closed-loop control.- Localization based on different sensors (range finders, cameras etc).- Mapping: environment model, grid map.- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM): basic principles and example algorithms.- Probabilistic sequential decision making: MDP (also RL), POMDP.- Logics for robotics; hybrid methods combining logics and probabilistic methods.- Ethics and practical issues in robotics.",

    "summary": "This course introduces the fundamental concepts of the theory of computer science, which include some of the greatest intellectual advances of the last century: what does `computing' mean? Are all `computers' basically the same? Can we tell whether our programs are `correct' - and what does `correct' mean, anyway? Can we solve problems in reasonable time, and can we tell whether we can?The course concentrates primarily on conceptual understanding, but adds enough detail to allow students to go on to further courses, and illustrates how the fundamental concepts are reflected throughout the discipline.",
    "course_description": "The first section of the course asks the question, what does it mean to compute? We start with the finite automata introduced in earlier years, and then generalise to pushdown automata, and show that they have more power. Next we generalize further to very simple abstract general computers, and argue they can do everything real computers can do. We then ask, can we solve every computational question? The answer, with which Turing shocked the mathematicians of the 1930s, is \"no\", with a remarkably easy but beautiful argument (introduced at the end of Inf2-IADS INFR08026). We then explore some different, but always equivalent, ways of defining \"a computer\". We finish the section by asking how we can compare the difficulty of different problems, and introduce the idea of \"reduction\" as a way of compiling one problem into another. Technically, this covers register machines, undecidability, Turing machines, and reductions.The second section thinks about how hard it is to solve solvable problems, leading to one of the most important problems in all mathematics, and the foundation of internet security. We start by reprising Inf2-IADS INFR08026 analysis of algorithms, and then discuss the idea of classifying problems as `tractable' (easy) or `intractable' (hard). We find that the idea of algorithms whose running time grows polynomially in the problem size is a good mathematical definition of `tractable', though not always a practical one. After making this more precise, we ask what happens if we're allowed to just check all the possible answers in parallel - does this give us more problem-solving power? The question is made precise by the concept of NP, and we show that there are \"hardest\" such problems, such as the famous Travelling Salesman. Although the question is easy to ask, nobody knows how to answer it. This is P = NP - if you can solve it, you win a million dollars, and fame for as long as civilization lasts.   So far, NP problems are very hard to solve in practice, so we discuss how to deal with them. We finish the section by talking about much harder problems still. Technically, this section covers P, NP, hardness and completeness, Cook's Theorem, P = NP, and the complexity hierarchy above NP.The third section takes brief look at a different way of seeing computation. Haskell needn't be seen as a programming language, it can be the computer itself. We'll show how the lambda-calculus (on which Haskell is based) can do all the computing our other models could, and how the halting problem was actually first solved (or rather unsolved) within lambda-calculus.",

It is intended to allow students to demonstrate their ability to organise and carry out a substantial piece of work. The project involves both the application of skills learnt in the past and the acquisition of new skills. Typical areas of activity will be: gathering and understanding background information; solving conceptual problems; design; implementation; experimentation and evaluation; writing up.The project is conducted individually by the student under the supervision of a member of teaching staff. The project specification is usually provided by a member of staff, but students are also free to specify their own project. All project specifications must be approved by the Project Coordinator.The project will normally involve the construction of an artefact, whether software, hardware, a robotic device, some other artefact incorporating computation, or some combination of these.This first half consists of a project that is essentially self contained but it should be planned in such a way as to allow for expansion and greater depth for the following year. Note that as this is the first half of an 80 point project it is recognized that a longer planning phase might be involved as compared to a standard UG4 project. In any case, the report should include a clear account of this aspect along with a justification.",

    "summary": "This course takes an interacting systems perspective on sustainability, using computational modelling and visualisation to gain understanding of system behaviours and interactions. Relevant complex systems key to sustainability arise from natural evolution (atmosphere, biosphere), social interactions (community, nation, economy), and engineering (energy, transport) - we look at computational models of such systems. Key concepts explored include emergent behaviour, stability and tipping points. Students from across the university will bring knowledge of the type of systems under study, or of computational methods - knowledge of both is not required.  Multidisciplinary group projects provide the opportunity to explore systems and gain experience working in interdisciplinary teams.",
    "course_description": "The fundamental aim of this course is for students from a variety of backgrounds, including Informatics, to get hands-on experience with specifying, implementing, exploring and presenting results from models of real-world systems that are key to planetary sustainability.  The range of such systems is vast, encompassing large parts of earth sciences, engineering, health sciences, social and political sciences.  Some key systems include the climate system, many ecosystems, agricultural systems, water systems, public health systems, social systems, international political systems, energy systems and transport systems. We will describe a subset of these systems, and there will be opportunity to develop deeper understanding in the project.Most of these are what are known as \"complex systems\", meaning: their behaviour and evolution often cannot be reduced to a few equations or paragraphs of description; they exhibit patterns of emergent global behaviour that are not explicitly encoded in any local interactions; they often exhibit multiple potential stable states, with not-easily-triggered \"tipping points\" to move to another stable state; stability is often exhibited as a dynamic pattern over time rather than as a fixed state. We will touch on the science of complex systems, focussing on those aspects that are of most relevance to the particular real-world systems we study.A ubiquitous challenge in sustainability is to appreciate how these individually complex systems interact with each other in the real world to produce unexpected outcomes.  The key methodology we will bring to the study of these systems and how they interact is computational modelling and visualisation.  We will study specific systems for which there are reasonably tractable computational models and visualisations.  For each, we will explore the underlying computational framework, be it a statistical model of observed data, a physical model of known physical / chemical / biological interactions, or an abstract model of ecological or social systems.  The modelling paradigms studied and used in practical work will include system dynamics and agent-based modelling, with brief mention of other paradigms such as discrete event and finite-step simulations.The first half will consist of lecture material covering the key system concepts, the specific systems to be studied, and the computational modelling and visualisation methods used for each system.  These will be supplemented by hands-on lab sessions, to explore computational models and visualisations using tools such as NetLogo and Python; and small-group tutorial sessions aimed at multidisciplinary discussions of specific systems.  The second half of the semester will be devoted to a group project in which each 3/4-person group will have students from at least 2 and ideally 3 or 4 disciplines; the project will aim to construct and explore a model of one or two complex systems related to sustainability (e.g., energy, economic and political); and project supervision will be provided by staff and PhD students familiar with the project systems and models.Assessment will be by coursework, aimed at the material covered in the first half of the semester, (systems and modelling paradigms) and a group project report and presentation for the work in the second half of the semester.",

Students learn to document designs in the Unified Modeling Language, UML, with emphasis on class, sequence and state diagrams and the Object Constraint Language, OCL. We use modern model-driven development tools and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. We study criteria that make one design better than another in context and introduce design principles and patterns that capture good practice.",
    "course_description": "The course begins by placing design and modelling in the context of the various software engineering processes in widespread use today. Via labs, lectures and self-study using readings, videos and formative exercises, it teaches students to produce (initially straightforward) designs and to document them using UML models, both on paper and with an appropriate tool. We discuss the different affordances of these modes and how models may be used (i) purely informally, (ii) as reviewed documentation for designs, and/or (iii) in model-driven development in which models are formal artefacts and code may be generated from them.The second part of the course focuses on identifying and producing good designs. What principles should a good object-oriented design follow? We learn some common design patterns and their role in development and learning.Finally we turn to practical model-driven development: how can the cost-benefit ratio of modelling be improved, now and potentially in the future? Students will learn about model transformations, both model-to-model and model-to-text (e.g., code generation) and be introduced to current tools supporting these. We discuss the role of domain specific languages and the integration of model driven development with agile processes. Throughout the course, we identify the deficiencies as well as the benefits of the fast-changing state of the art, aiming to equip students to critically evaluate tools and techniques that become available to them in future.",

The course develops skills to select and apply a testing strategy and testing techniques that are appropriate to a particular development process, software system, or component. Class members will become capable users of test tools; will be able to assess the effectiveness of their testing activity; and will be able provide evidence to justify their evaluation. The course is assessed by portfolio demonstrating the achievement of the learning outcomes. This course is based on the IEEE Software Engineering 2004 Software Testing syllabus.",
    "course_description": "Software testing is embedded in all software development processes and in recent years with the widespread adoption of DevOps and Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment, testing tools, automated testing, and the use of operational data in testing have become increasingly important.The course includes the following topics:Testing techniques and principles: Defects vs. failures, equivalence classes, boundary testing.Types of defects.Black-box vs. Structural testing.Testing strategies: Unit testing, integration testing, profiling, test driven development.State based testing; configuration testing; compatibility testing; web site testing.Alpha, beta, and acceptance testing.Coverage criteria.Test instrumentation and tools.Developing test plans.Managing the testing process: Development LifecyclesProblem reporting, tracking, and analysis.Relevant QAA Computing Curriculum Sections: Software EngineeringClass members will take the development of tests for a small software project as their focus.  For students taking the Informatics Large Practical course we recommend they take the software developed there as their focus.  However, students are free to choose other software projects if they prefer.  The goal is to gain experience of the full spectrum of testing techniques, test planning, testing process and demonstrate that experience on the chosen software project.Class members will work in groups of 10 and will be encouraged to share experience by providing comment and reviews of others work.  Weekly tutorials will be structured around different aspects of the course and the development of a portfolio describing the work done on the selected software project.Each class member will develop an individual portfolio demonstrating they have achieved the learning outcomes of the course.   This will use work on the testing of their chosen software project as evidence, augmented by appropriate other evidence.  Acceptable kinds of evidence demonstrating achievement of the learning outcomes are diverse so part of the assessment is the design of the portfolio in advance of its construction.  There are two or three \"standard\" portfoliodesigns but class members are encouraged to develop their own approaches that take account of their personal strengths and weaknesses.  Portfolio designs will include specific assessment criteria.Each week there will be a group meeting, around 1-2 hours of recorded material covering the lecture material in the course.  Guest lectures given by a practitioner on their experience of testing in different contexts will illustrate the application of the concepts covered in the course in the development of a real-world product.",

    "course_description": "*This is a work-based course and is only available as part of the Graduate Apprenticeship BSc Hons in Data Science.*The aim of this course is to provide data science graduate apprenticeship students with work-based professional practice in the application of data analysis and statistical techniques. It gives students a practical introduction and understanding of the foundations, concepts and techniques applied to data analytics and provides an opportunity to apply the learning gained in the core courses to address data analysis problems and challenges in the workplace. The main topics are: the application of data analysis tools and techniques, an introduction to common data quality problems, and the application of statistics and machine learning. In addition, this course covers the meta-skills required to operate in a professional environment including teamwork, problem-solving and communication skills and personal self-awareness.The course is delivered over four months during Semester 2 of Year 4. Students are expected to spend around 200 hours in total on this course on data science activities embedded in the work activities the employer will set. The work will directly link to their own contexts in the workplace. Students will be directed in their learning using the Student-Led Individually Created Course (SLICC) approach. They will reflect on and evaluate data analysis studies from their own work context in data analytics.The SLICC framework requires that students use the generic learning outcomes to articulate their learning in their own defined project, reflect frequently using a blog, and collect and curate evidence of their learning in an e-portfolio. The final report which forms the summative assessment will draw together the evidence in the reflective journals and portfolios. All this is carried out with the guidance of a professional practice academic tutor. The course will encourage appraisal of students' own practical experiences and allow them to reflect on their learning, professional and personal development in the context of data analytics.",

We cover a range of foundational concepts, theoretical and computational models of language, and linguistic phenomena. We focus on what makes automatic processing of language unique and challenging: its statistical properties, complex structure, and pervasive ambiguity. We use English as the primary exemplar throughout, but also discuss similarities and differences to other languages, and the implications for computational models.As we progress from lower levels of linguistic structure (words and morphemes) through syntax to semantics and discourse, we cover formal models and algorithms for representing and analysing these different types of structure (e.g., n-gram models, HMMs, dependency parsing, dynamic programming, and word embeddings). These methods form the conceptual foundation for understanding state-of-the-art approaches, which are covered in depth in the Semester 2 follow-on course NLU+. We also introduce methodological and ethical considerations (e.g., evaluation, data collection, algorithmic bias) that are important for research in the field.",

In this course, students will learn the major algorithmic techniques and practical skills in robotics that can be applied and transferred to many real-world applications, such as manipulation of surgical robotics and robot assembly in automobile and manufacturing.The course assumes no prior knowledge of robotics, so begins with a high-level overview of the major areas in robotics and then introduces core topics: kinematics, dynamics and control; state estimation and signal processing; digital control systems; optimisation and optimal control; robot motion planning and basics of robot learning.Building on these fundamentals, the course then focuses on the advanced control and task planning of articulated robotic systems, e.g. robotic manipulators. Students develop a lab practical in both simulation and on a real robot, so as to consolidate theoretical knowledge and develop practical skills.",
    "course_description": "This is a fast-paced course that starts with the fundamentals and then proceeds to go in-depth with core elements in robotics. The focused topics cover: kinematics, dynamics and control; state estimation and signal processing; digital control systems; optimisation, robot motion planning; and robot learning.The aim of the course is to present essentials in robotics, articulated robots in particular, culminating in a robotic lab practical. The lab involves the development of an integrated robotic system which embodies the major algorithmic techniques used in real-world robotic applications. To bridge the lectures on algorithms and lab sessions, the course also provides tutorials dedicated to the practice of programming and the implementation of algorithms - from the equations to code.Lectures on these topics will be complemented by labs that exercise knowledge of a cross section of these techniques, based on realistic tasks driven by real-world applications, such as dual-arm robot manipulation. The practical lab consists of 2 parts: individual-based simulation (80%), and group-based real robot demonstration (20%). The lab demonstration will be carried out on an advanced humanoid robot and students will work in groups to deploy their work on the real robot.",

    "summary": "Game theory is the formal study of interaction between \"self-interested\" (or \"goal-oriented\") \"systems\" (or \"agents\" or \"decision makers\" or \"players\"), & strategic scenarios that arise in such settings. It began life in Economics in the 1940's with the work of von Neumann & Morgenstern, but has since been applied to an extraordinary range of subjects, including political science, evolutionary biology & even to inspection regimes for arms control.Game theory has for years also played an important, if less recognized, role in several branches of computer science. Applications within computer science include the use of games in automated verification & model checking to model computing systems in an unknown and possibly adverse environment. In AI games are applied to the analysis of multi-agent systems. Recently, with the advent of the internet and e-commerce, many game theoretic questions in the interplay between economics & computing have received extensive attention. These include electronic auctions, & more generally mechanism design questions (inverse game theory) related to finding incentive structures for cooperation between independent entities on the internet.Wherever game theory plays a quantitative role, algorithmic and computational questions related to \"solving\" games are also of central importance.This course aims to bring together as a coherent body of knowledge the game theoretic algorithms & models that underpin several flourishing subjects at the intersection of computer science, economics and e-commerce, & AI.",

    "summary": "This course provides students with a hands-on introduction to programming in the cloud environment, contemporary tools and technologies and their application in individual software projects.Students will gain the experience needed to differentiate between different architecture styles (like CaaS, SaaS, IaaS, PaaS, etc.) and explain the basic building blocks of cloud programming like containerization, micro-services, event-processing and the various communication protocols and methodologies used. They will be able to summarize cloud service offerings by the main providers like Amazon, Azure, Google and IBM and contrast differences and explain the need and structure of CI/CD-chains in cloud programming.",
    "course_description": "The course gives students experience in developing in cloud environments with their special requirements and the current toolset used. In this way, the course provides a working foundation and overview for later in-depth experiences in more specialized areas of cloud-programming.All implementations are done in Java; some extra information (non-assessed) will be provided in Golang, Rust or other suitable languages for the problem at hand, thus exposing and equipping the student further in cloud-programming specific technologies.In particular, the student gains practical experience of:-\tIdentifying cloud specific problems, patterns and solutions-\tUnderstanding available tools and their application-\tIdentifying and formalising project requirements-\tIdentifying the most suitable toolsets and language environments to use for a given problem-\tConstructing a detailed design which does not over-commit to implementation detail-\tImplementing and testing a software application which realises the design-\tExperimenting with the implementations to explore the solutions to the computational problems-\tWriting a report which documents the solutions and the implementation",

    "summary": "This is an introductory course for the discipline of Bioinformatics for students from both physical science and life science backgrounds. Bioinformatics is an inter-disciplinary subject that develops and implements novel methodologies and tools for analysing and learning from biological data. These data are increasingly large and complex because of significant technological developments and their application at scale in biological and biomedical application areas.In this course, we will cover the fundamental domain knowledge needed from both biological and computational disciplines to enable further study and research in this subject with a strong emphasis on practical applications of the taught methods.",
    "course_description": "In this course, we will introduce key biological concepts including the main types of molecules we study (DNA, RNA, and protein) and the cell biological processes involved in the regulation and function of biological systems. The cornerstone of foundational Bioinformatics lies in the analysis of sequences; strings of characters that encode genetic information in organisms. We will describe the theory and put into practice how we work with and analyse these sequences using a range of databases, algorithms, and tools. You will undertake mini research projects using publicly available data to put your learning into practice. The course is taught using Python; students need to be comfortable with basic coding in Python as this is required to use the course notebooks each week and for the assessed coursework.Topics change slightly each year, but typically include:pairwise and multiple sequence alignment, biological databases, ontologies & functional enrichment analysis, network analysis, multi-omics analysis (transcriptomics, proteomics, methylomics), and biomedical text analytics.",

Students will learn to assess the limitations of the state of the art and critically appraise novel uses of the latest design methods, theories and technologies.The course is organised around a series of case study domains, which are introduced via lectures. Wherever possible, examples are taken from the ongoing or recent research at the University of Edinburgh. The case studies will be discussed in groups with lecturers, tutors and fellow students in relation to theory, methods and their legal, ethical and social dimensions. There will be an individual assignment focused on critically appraising a design informatics case study.Students will also work in groups, supported by senior students (normally, experienced students who are enrolled in CDI2), with a member of academic staff as mentor. In parallel, each group works on its own to develop a speculative design response to a selected case study domain or context, producing a prototype and conducting a short evaluative study based on that prototype.",

    "summary": "How would you help the next generation of Design Informatics students avoid the mistakes you made? Every time a decision is made to pursue one course of action, other routes are closed off. The goal is to lead a group of fresh thinkers to see why you made particular project design decisions, and to help them map out a different service or product that could be built from the same components.",
    "course_description": "This course extends students' engagement with real examples in the emerging field of Design Informatics. A key component of the course is the detailed evaluation and rationale behind several current research projects that highlight the limitations of the state of the art, or novel use of the latest theories and technologies. The primary learning outcome is the development of specialist reflective and leadership skills that can then be exploited in future industrial application or academic research into Design Informatics.The senior students following this course as part of a two-year masters complete a compulsory summer placement, and then work with junior students (normally, who are enrolled in CDI1).The syllabus divides into three parts.- In Part 1, students complete a summer internship placement and are then debriefed on it in a series of tutorials in the beginning of the year- In Part 2, students support junior students (typically enrolled in CDI1) in their group case studies. This support can take a variety of forms, from mentoring a group of younger students to providing training and support in specialist techniques.- In Part 3, concurrently to the support provided to junior students, the students are mentored on their final Masters thesis, similar to the Informatics Research Proposal (INFR11137). This mentoring is in addition to the work students do with their supervisors and will cover key skills required to complete a Masters thesisFor Parts 1 and 3, a mix of tutorials and lectures are used.",

This course will not be delivered during 2023-24, and will be officially closed from 31st July 2024.There are several languages for programming quantum protocols. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. This course surveys current platforms (OpenQAsm, Qiskit, Q#, Quipper, Quantomatic, and PyZX) and analyses their respective features semantically. The theoretical analysis uses category theory, a powerful mathematical tool in logic and informatics, that has influenced the design of many modern programming languages. It enables a powerful graphical calculus that lets you draw pictures instead of writing algebraic expressions. This technique is visually extremely insightful, yet completely rigorous. For example, correctness of protocols often comes down to whether a picture is connected or disconnected, whether there is information flow from one end to another. In a practical way, this course investigates the conceptual reasons why quantum protocols and quantum computing work, rather than their algorithmic and complexity-theoretic aspects.",
    "course_description": "The course has two parallel tracks: a practical one, and a theoretical one. The practical track surveys different quantum programming platforms. These include OpenQAsm, Qiskit, Q#,  Quipper, Quantomatic, and PyZX. We discuss their basic structure, strengths, and weaknesses. Via labs and live coding in lectures, students get hands-on experience of implementing small quantum programs. The emphasis is on the primitive programming constructs and structure of each language, not on large-scale quantum software development.Simultaneously, the theoretical track analyses the features of each language in denotational semantics, focusing on monoidal categories. Via lectures and self-study reading, the course teaches students the basics of dual objects in monoidal categories. Specific attention is paid to the graphical calculus, which makes the topic visually apparent. Via exercise sheets, and their review incorporated into the contact hours, the student learns to graphically manipulate algebraic objects such as monoids and Frobenius structures. They will understand that this still allows perfectly rigorous proofs of correctness, and be able to see the information flow of a protocol that is often hidden behind superfluous details.Throughout the course, the practical and theoretical material is linked. We will study notions typically thought to belong to quantum theory, such as entanglement, no-cloning, teleportation, and complementarity. It will turn out some of these notions also make perfect sense in other settings. For example, the very same categorical description of quantum teleportation also describes classical encryption with a one-time pad. We identify characteristics of classical and quantum information, aiming to equip students to choose the right tools and techniques for future problems they may encounter.",

We will focus on methods and best practices in geometry and physical simulation, which are the basic building blocks for downstream applications such as animation, industrial design, game engineering, structural analysis, AR/VR, and medical imaging. Our curriculum will cover basic representations of shapes, geometric optimization, analysis, and principles of robust digital simulation of physical scenes. The techniques employed will involve classical numerical analysis up to deep geometric learning.The course will include programming tasks to implement a few key algorithms in geometry processing, geometric learning, and physical simulation, to the extent that they can independently run and be analysed on modest open-source data.This course (CGGS) and Computer Graphics: Rendering (CGR) are both courses that require no previous knowledge of computer graphics. These two courses may be taken independently or together. CGGS focusses on the representation, processing, and dynamics of 3D objects in the virtual world while CGR focusses on the rendering of virtual worlds as photo-realistic images.",

    "course_description": "Only available to Informatics MSc students on the Data Science or Design Informatics MSc programmes.This course teaches general knowledge about theory, application, design, and evaluation of visualisations. The goal of the course is to enable students to understand the potential of visualisations and how interactive visualisation interfaces can support the workflow of data analysis.The course will enable students to describe a visualisation problem, to explore the data using visualisations, to discuss and design appropriate visualisation concepts, and to implement and critically reflect on them. The course is designed for an interdisciplinary audience, targeting students with a background in design, informatics, and other areas. General programming skills are not required but some relevant JavaScript library (D3.js, https://d3js.org) are provided during the first weeks of the course. Besides interactive visualisations, students can opt to create static visualisations (infographics, data comics, posters, etc), data physicalisations, or any other form discussed in the course.During most of the course, students will work in groups of two to three students using real-world datasets they find themselves or which are provided. Groups will go through all the stages of the exploration and visualisation design process, in alignment with the above listed learning outcomes; explore data and make initial findings, critique the tools and list shortcomings and possible future features, create custom visualisation designs for exploration or presentation, present the visualisations. For a final presentation, each group is expected to present a comprehensive visualisation design project, insights gained, and critical reflections.The course aims for 11 lectures, each targeting a set of principles in data visualisations, and organized as shown below. Lectures will be held as a flipped classroom where lectures require listening to a previously recorded lecture, or reading a book chapter or representative (easy to understand) scientific paper.Lecture topics:1.\tFoundations of data visualisation: Perception, visual variables, exploratory data analysis, explanatory visualisation, scenarios, tools.2.\tVisualisation Techniques: visualisations for statistical data, hierarchies and networks, temporal data, geographical data, multivariate data, etc.3.\tAdvanced topics: data-driven storytelling, interaction techniques, and evaluation techniques.4.\tGuest lectures (to be decided upon availability): data physicalisation, visual analytics, geo-visualisation, visualisation in immersive environments, HCI for visualisation, etc.",

Students will complete two projects to assess their practical and writing skills, and also sit an exam.The topics in the course will be covered in two interconnected sections, with indicative topics listed below:1) Social Networks* Introduction to network science* Different types of social networks* Metrics and communities* Tools for network analysis* Financial networks2) Agent-based modelling* Rational and biased agents* Modelling decision making with agents* Calibration and validation of agent-based models* Case studies in business, finance, and economicsStudents will develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills during tutorials. Some tutorials will involve pencil-and-paper exercises where students solve increasingly difficult problems (presented in a way similar to that of the exam) on network science, and mathematical modelling of human behaviour. In others, students will work on real-world datasets and will be guided through the whole process of modelling human behaviour from a practical point of view, applying the notions learned during classes. The skills here acquired will be then assessed during the courseworks, which will be similar to what covered in the tutorials.",

Difficulties arise from the concurrency of components, the lack of a global clock and the possibility of independent failure of components. Moreover designs must aim to provide inter-operability, transparency and autonomy.The emphasis of this module is on gaining understanding of the principles and concepts that are used to design distributed systems and how network and communication facilities can be leveraged to achieve efficient distributed computing.",

    "summary": "Formal verification is the use of mathematical techniques to verify the correctness of various kinds of engineering systems: software systems and digital hardware systems, for example. Formal verification techniques are exhaustive and provide much stronger guarantees of correctness than testing or simulation-based approaches. They are particularly useful for safety and security critical systems and for when system behaviour is highly complex. The course focuses on automated techniques that are currently used in industry. It gives practical exposure to current formal verification tools, explaining the input languages used and introducing the underlying mathematical techniques and algorithms used for automation.",
    "course_description": "In recent years there have been highly noteworthy cases of the adoption of formal verification (FV) techniques in industry. For example, at Intel, FV has largely replaced simulation-based verification of their microprocessors, at Microsoft, FV is used to certify that 3rd party drivers are free of certain kinds of concurrency bugs. As FV tools and methodologies improve, FV is expected to become more and more widely used in industry.This course aims to familiarise students with main classes of FV techniques that are likely to become most widespread in industry in the coming years. The intent is to prepare students who might go into industry with sufficient background in FV that they would be aware of when and how they might deploy FV techniques. The course will also be of interest to students who wish to go into research developing techniques for future-generation FV tools and who might need to use FV in their research. To satisfy these aims, the course has a practical focus, giving students hands-on experience with a number of tools and explaining their input languages for specifying systems and desired system properties. The course also introduces the underlying mathematical techniques, which gives students a deeper understanding of the tools and will help them use the tools most effectively.Topics the course covers include the following:*Formal verification in context, its current take-up in industry and challenges to its wideradoption*Syntax and semantics of CTL and LTL temporal logics*CTL and LTL model checking techniques, including automata-based approaches andbounded model checking with SAT solvers*The BDD data-structure used at the heart of many model checkers*Writing models for model checking and phrasing useful properties in CTL and LTL*Operational semantics of a simple imperative programming language, weakest preconditionoperators and verification condition generation*The capabilities of SMT solvers for discharging verification conditions*Assertion-based software verificationOptional topics include:*Industrial temporal logics such as PSL and SVA used in hardware verification*Formal verification case studies*Formal verification of hybrid systems, system with both discrete state changes andcontinuous state changes governed by differential equations*Combining formal and simulation-based verification methods*Dual use of temporal logic properties and assertions in formal and simulation-basedverification of hardware and software*Software model checking, focusing on its use for finding concurrency bugs*Pattern-based detection of concurrency bugs",

The basic software package that supports the management of data is called a database management system (DBMS). The main goal of this course is to explain some of the underlying theoretical principles and characteristics of DBMSs. More precisely, this course will explain how real-life concepts (such as a database and a query) and phenomena (such as incompleteness and inconsistency of data), can be abstracted from their physical implementation and mathematically formalised using tools coming from other areas such as computational logic. This will pave the way towards the study of query evaluation, that is, the central task of extracting meaningful information from (possibly incomplete and inconsistent) data by means of queries, following a mathematically rigorous approach. This analysis will expose the source of complexity in evaluating a query over a database, which in turn provides ideas and tools on how to devise more efficient query evaluation algorithms.",

    "course_description": "The course proceeds in five parts from foundational concepts such as image formation, through to low-level image processing operations, before building upon those to develop image representations, and use those representations for higher-level tasks such as recognition and detection. The following four parts are roughly two weeks each.Image formation. The basic mathematics and physics of how images are formed based on light reflected by real-world objects. Includes ideal pinhole camera and lens models. Some basic 3D geometry, radiometry and photometry.Low-level image analysis. We will introduce basic algorithms such as convolution and filtering for image processing, and RANSAC for fitting. These will be applied for tasks such as edge detection, and line-fitting. To provide a taste of recognition students will perform shape recognition using Bayes theorem.Image Representations: To support working with more unconstrained realistic images, we next introduce feature representations for both local and global features including colour histograms, HOG/SIFT, and descriptor bag of words.High-level image analysis: Building upon these image representations, we discuss the topical tasks of object recognition and sliding window-based object detection.Applications: Finally, we finish up with an introduction to some applications including basic video processing (optical flow), and foreground detection.",

The course will offer an introduction to modern cryptography focusing on models and proofs of security for various basic cryptographic primitives and protocols. Cryptographic proofs are conditional on assumptions that fall in two categories: \"system assumptions\" such as the faithful execution of code, or the availability of private randomness and \"computational assumptions\". The latter are related to the computational complexity of various problems (including factoring large numbers and others). Students will learn to model security problems and prove them secure under precisely formulated system and computational assumptions.",
    "course_description": "The course is divided in two parts: Private Key and Public Key.Topics covered in the Private Key part are: classical ciphers (Caesar, Vigenere), one-time pad and perfect secrecy, computational secrecy, pseudorandom functions and permutations, CPA security, CCA security and proofs by reduction. The following topics are also briefly discussed: block ciphers, modes of operation, message integrity, hash functions and MACs.In the Public Key part we cover: hard computational problems such as factoring and discrete log, the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, ElGamal and digital signatures. Other topics that may also be discussed (depending on time) are: zero-knowledge proofs, Schnorr Identification, commitment schemes and oblivious transfer protocols. A tentative outline of the material is given below.Part 1: Private Key- Classical ciphers: Shift cipher, Vigenere- Perfect secrecy- One-time pad (OTP)- Computational secrecy- Pseudorandom generators (PRG)- Pseudo-OTP- Security against chosen-plaintext attacks (CPA)- Pseudorandom functions / permutations (PRF / PRP)- CPA-secure encryption using PRF/PRP: block ciphers- Modes of operation: block ciphers, stream ciphers- Malleability- Security against chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA)- Padding-oracle attacks: non-CCA secure schemes- Secrecy vs. integrity: message authentication codes (MAC)- Hash functionsPart 2: Public Key- Digital Signatures- Trapdoor One-Way functions- Random oracles- Cyclic groups- The discrete logarithm/Diffie-Hellman assumptions- Key exchange and the Diffie-Hellman protocol- Public Key Encryption- Security against chosen-plaintext attacks- ElGamal Encryption- Zero-Knowledge proofs- The Schnorr identification scheme",

    "summary": "This course replaces Categories and Quantum Informatics (INFR11128) from 2023-2024.There are several languages for programming quantum protocols. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. This course surveys current platforms (OpenQAsm, Qiskit, Q#, Quipper, Quantomatic, and PyZX) and analyses their respective features semantically. The theoretical analysis uses category theory, a powerful mathematical tool in logic and informatics, that has influenced the design of many modern programming languages. It enables a powerful graphical calculus that lets you draw pictures instead of writing algebraic expressions. This technique is visually extremely insightful, yet completely rigorous. For example, correctness of protocols often comes down to whether a picture is connected or disconnected, whether there is information flow from one end to another. In a practical way, this course investigates the conceptual reasons why quantum protocols and quantum computing work, rather than their algorithmic and complexity-theoretic aspects.",
    "course_description": "The course has two parallel tracks: a practical one, and a theoretical one. The practical track surveys different quantum programming platforms. These include OpenQAsm, Qiskit, Q#, Quipper, Quantomatic, and PyZX. We discuss their basic structure, strengths, and weaknesses. Via labs and live coding in lectures, students get hands-on experience of implementing small quantum programs. The emphasis is on the primitive programming constructs and structure of each language, not on large-scale quantum software development.Simultaneously, the theoretical track analyses the features of each language in denotational semantics, focusing on monoidal categories. Via lectures and self-study reading, the course teaches students the basics of dual objects in monoidal categories. Specific attention is paid to the graphical calculus, which makes the topic visually apparent. Via exercise sheets, and their review incorporated into the contact hours, the student learns to graphically manipulate algebraic objects such as monoids and Frobenius structures. They will understand that this still allows perfectly rigorous proofs of correctness, and be able to see the information flow of a protocol that is often hidden behind superfluous details.Throughout the course, the practical and theoretical material is linked. We will study notions typically thought to belong to quantum theory, such as entanglement, no-cloning, teleportation, and complementarity. It will turn out some of these notions also make perfect sense in other settings. For example, the very same categorical description of quantum teleportation also describes classical encryption with a one-time pad. We identify characteristics of classical and quantum information, aiming to equip students to choose the right tools and techniques for future problems they may encounter.",

It is intended to allow students to demonstrate their ability to organise and carry out a substantial piece of work. The project involves both the application of skills learnt in the past and the acquisition of new skills.Typical areas of activity will be:- gathering and understanding background information;-  solving conceptual problems;- design; implementation;- experimentation and evaluation;- writing up.The project is conducted individually by the student under the supervision of a member of teaching staff. The project specification is usually provided by a member of staff, but students are also free to specify their own project. All project specifications must be approved by the Project Coordinator.The project will normally involve the construction of an artefact, whether software, hardware, a robotic device, some other artefact incorporating computation, or some combination of these.This second half continues from MInf Project (Part 1) starting with work identified in the Conclusion section of the report for MInf Project (Part 1). It is expected that work here will go into greater depth, the work carried out is not necessarily limited to that which was identified in MInf Project (Part 1).",

Students will learn to manage ambiguity by accurately modelling data from real-world datasets and constructing effective queries. The competencies developed in both data handling and ML will foster an integrated approach to knowledge application when devising comprehensive coursework solutions.Personal Effectiveness:The coursework is structured into three stages, culminating in a requirement for students to submit a report that describes their programs, profiling results, strategies for addressing associated problems, thereby refining their planning and organizational skills. Creating a real-world ML system can broaden into wider business applications, potentially opening avenues for entrepreneurship.Personal Responsibility:We will instruct students on ensuring data security (e.g., using trusted hardware) and privacy (e.g., through federated learning), fostering ethical and socially responsible practices. Moreover, by developing their own ML programs, students will engage in independent learning. They will also be encouraged to go beyond standard solutions, which will inspire creative thinking.Communication:Students are required to submit a written report and will receive ongoing feedback from lecturers and tutors, enhancing their verbal and written communication skills. Working with datasets from various disciplines will also prepare them to operate effectively in cross-disciplinary environments.",

Students will learn to manage ambiguity by accurately modelling data from real-world datasets and constructing effective queries. The competencies developed in both data handling and ML will foster an integrated approach to knowledge application when devising comprehensive coursework solutions.Personal Effectiveness:The coursework is structured into three stages, culminating in a requirement for students to submit a report that describes their programs, profiling results, strategies for addressing associated problems, thereby refining their planning and organizational skills. Creating a real-world ML system can broaden into wider business applications, potentially opening avenues for entrepreneurship.Personal Responsibility:We will instruct students on ensuring data security (e.g., using trusted hardware) and privacy (e.g., through federated learning), fostering ethical and socially responsible practices. Moreover, by developing their own ML programs, students will engage in independent learning. They will also be encouraged to go beyond standard solutions, which will inspire creative thinking.Communication:Students are required to submit a written report and will receive ongoing feedback from lecturers and tutors, enhancing their verbal and written communication skills. Working with datasets from various disciplines will also prepare them to operate effectively in cross-disciplinary environments.",

    "course_description": "Project dependent.This is a major piece of full-time independent work which occupies the final months of the MSc course. If taken as part of a one-year masters, it accounts for all of a student's time following their course exams. If taken as part of a two-year masters, it accounts for 1/3 of student time during Semester 1 of Year 2, and 2/3 of student time in Semester 2 of Year 2. It allows students to demonstrate their ability to organise and carry out a substantial investigation into a problem in Design Informatics, according to sound scientific, engineering and design principles. The project involves both the application of skills learnt in the past and the acquisition of new skills. The project often involves the construction of an artefact, whether software, hardware, a robotic device, some other artefact incorporating computation, or some combination of these.The types of activity involved in each project vary but include most of the following:- Researching the literature and gathering background information.- Analysing requirements, comparing alternatives and specifying a solution.- Analysing and exploiting relevant theory in novel ways.- Designing and implementing the solution.- Experimenting with and evaluating the solution.- Exploring the solution as part of a product or service.- Discussing existing results and presenting new research.- Developing written and oral presentation skills.The project is conducted individually by the student under the supervision of a member of teaching staff.  Students are formed into groups for the purpose of Review Meetings.",

    "summary": "Causal inference is an important emerging area in AI and data science allowing us to move away from merely associational statements towards cause-effect statements. Being able to develop and/or apply causal inference techniques has broad applications in social and biomedical sciences, e.g., in answering questions such as \"How effective is a given treatment for curing/preventing a disease?\" or \"Which genetic variants can causally increase the risk of disease and hence be targeted by drugs?\" or \"What economic policy could have prevented the 2008 financial crisis?\"In this course we develop causal inference techniques to address the above questions. This is a relatively advanced course and students are expected to be familiar with foundations of probability, statistics and calculus (see \"Other Requirements\" box)",

This theoretical course presents state-of-the-art mathematical models and techniques that make understanding concurrency possible. In the process, we will touch on fundamental philosophical, mathematical and computational questions. What does 'concurrency' actually mean? How do we know our concurrent system behaves correctly? What does 'correctly' actually mean? This course is especially relevant to any student with an interest in a scientific career in programming languages, models, or distributed systems, and also to students looking to design or implement distributed systems in industry.",
    "course_description": "Beginning with simple examples and protocols, we will develop a theory to describe models of concur-rent systems of increasing complexity, based on process algebra. We will learn how to compare these models, and the key concepts that describe what it means for systems to be equivalent, such as bisimulation and trace equivalence. We will learn how to specify prove  properties of systems, and the assumptions we must make about the environment in which these systems operate, such as fairness. The course lectures will introduce concepts using standard examples, and students will apply what they have learned to new problems in homework questions delivered weekly. In tutorials, students can discuss solutions to their homework problems and get feedback on their work, developing their solutions into a summative homework portfolio that they submit for grading at two checkpoints throughout the semester.",

    "summary": "This module teaches you about bio-inspired algorithms for optimisation and search problems. The algorithms are based on simulated evolution (including Genetic algorithms and Genetic programming), particle swarm optimisation, ant colony optimisation as well as systems made of membranes or biochemical reactions among molecules. These techniques are useful for searching very large spaces. For example, they can be used to search large parameter spaces in engineering design and spaces of possible schedules in scheduling. However, they can also be used to search for rules and rule sets, for data mining, for good feed-forward or recurrent neural nets and so on. The idea of evolving, rather than designing, algorithms and controllers is especially appealing in AI. In a similar way it is tempting to use the intrinsic dynamics of real systems consisting e.g. of quadrillions of molecules to perform computations for us. The course includes technical discussions about the applicability and a number of practical applications of the algorithms.In this module, students will learn about- The practicalities of natural computing methods: How to design algorithms for particular classes of problems.- Some of the underlying theory: How such algorithms work and what is provable about them.- Issues of experimental design: How to decide whether an metaheuristic algorithm works well.- Current commercial applications.- Current research directions.",

Initial motivation will be provided by consideration of a number of typical high performance applications and parallel architectures. This will highlight the role of parallel software systems as a means of bridging the gap between these and allow abstraction of the issues which must be addressed by any such system (partitioning, communication, agglomeration, scheduling). It will explore the ways in which these challenges have been addressed by a range of systems, including both de facto standards and more adventurous research projects.",

The student will develop inter-disciplinary and collaborative research skills building on programme level training in advance of the placement project being undertaken.Personal Responsibility:- Students will begin to build their independence both in learning and their research. They will take responsibility for their project and be able to argue the case for the approach they have adopted. They will consider alternative approaches critically, be receptive to challenge from others, and open to advice and guidance to help them develop as an independent researcher.Communication:- Students will submit a formal written dissertation for the research project and present their research in a short scientific talk to their peers and other member of staff involved in the programme. They will discuss both in feedback sessions with their supervisors.- During the project the students will develop their ability to articulate and explain complex issues to groups of people from varying academic disciplinary backgrounds.- They will also have the opportunity to develop resources such as training materials, code repositories, and/or outreach activities based on their placement projects where appropriate.",

ML techniques provide adversaries with new capabilities to undermine the security and privacy of ICT systems. Moreover, there is a growing recognition of the security and privacy issues of ML algorithms. These issues can have tremendous consequences in a society that increasingly relies on ML, so they call for more robust methods that allow harnessing the benefits of ML in adversarial settings.This is an introductory course on the topic. The course will provide an overview of adversarial applications of ML techniques, including those that undermine the privacy and security of ML-based systems. The course will also cover existing countermeasures and mitigation strategies.",

For example, short segments of speech may be ambiguous, and we need to take into account context in order to make sense of an utterance. Probability theory provides a rigorous method for representing and reasoning with uncertain knowledge. The course covers two main areas (i) the process of inference with probabilistic models and (ii) learning probabilistic models from data.Its aim is to provide a firm grounding in probabilistic modelling and reasoning, and to give a basis which will allow students to go on to develop their interests in more specific areas, such as statistical language modelling, bioinformatics, computational neuroscience, or computer vision, to name a few examples.",
    "course_description": "The course will cover the most important topics in probabilistic modelling and unsupervised learning, and provide a thorough basis for understanding extensions, further developments and applications.While the precise topics will vary slightly from year to year, the core content will revolve around:- probabilistic graphical models- exact inference- learning from data- methods for approximate inference and learningThe course will be delivered in a series of lectures and exercises.

    "summary": "In this course we cover a broad range of effects that the development of quantum technologies bring on the security and privacy of communication and computation. In particular we consider (i) post-quantum security: security of classical protocols when the adversaries have access to quantum computers or other quantum technologies and (ii) quantumly-enhanced security: when quantum technologies are used by honest parties to achieve better (in terms of security or efficiency) performance. We give an overview of the field, while in each case we focus on selected examples to illustrate how to handle security in a world with quantum technologies.",
    "course_description": "This course deals with the various effects that developing quantum technologies will have on cyber security. Quantum computing and quantum information theory offers new possibilities (in terms of efficiency and security). Here we examine both the extra attacks that adversaries equipped with quantum technologies can perform and the extra possibilities opened when honest parties use quantum technologies.The students first will be introduced to quantum information concepts (qubits, mixed states, operations, distance measures) as well as quantum algorithms (factoring, discrete logarithms, search) and their limitations. This will lead to LO1, namely learn the mathematical machinery and the power (and limitations) of quantum information and computation, in view of using these for cyber security.The second part consists of learning and understanding quantum cryptography and specifically \"quantum-key-distribution\" protocols, including their security proofs and the how different implementations affect the performance (see LO4). The limitations (practical and theoretical) of quantum cryptography will also be analysed here (including impossibility results).The third part deals with generalising classical notions such as encryption, authentication and secure delegated computation to quantum information. Introducing students in these concepts prepares them for the next generation of quantum cyber security that is bound to become relevant when large(r) quantum computers are constructed (LO5).Finally, the last part of the course focuses on classical protocols and their security under quantum attacks. A cryptosystem based on the learning-with-errors problems will be introduced as a (key) example of this possibility (LO2). Furthermore, general quantum attacks (superposition attacks, the quantum random oracle model, etc) will be introduced and students will learn to analyse general quantum attacks on a given classical protocol (LO3).",

    "summary": "This course studies the principles and practices of secure programming. Secure programming means writing programs in a safe fashion, to avoid vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. It also means using security features provided by libraries, such as authentication and encryption, appropriately and effectively. A range of programming platforms will be considered, ranging from low-level (e.g. Android OS), through web programming (e.g., JavaScript and Python) to high-level large-scale languages (e.g., Java). New and emerging language-based security mechanisms will be examined, including ways of specifying and enforcing security policies statically and dynamically (e.g., to enforce access controls or information flow policies).",

    "summary": "This course aims to give students a thorough understanding of how to engineer security in modern systems. We discuss threat actors from nation states through cybercrime gangs to abuse by family members. We dive into detailed case studies of applications such as payment networks and vehicle systems. We analyse the protection mechanisms of platforms they rely on, such as smartcards, mobile phones and cloud systems. We work through multiple perspectives: classical systems engineering, the psychology of users good and bad, and the incentives facing different actors in the system. This enables students to take a holistic view of security as an emergent property of complex systems, and of related properties such as safety, and to understand how to manage them as systems and their environments evolve.",
    "course_description": "As ever more devices participate in online systems that become ever more complex, it is ever more important, and more difficult, to manage emergent properties such as security, safety and sustainability. Security engineering is not just about individual mechanisms such as cryptography and access controls but how they work together at scale in real systems. This course will illustrate how to analyse threats and hazards systematically, evolve security policies, integrate them with safety policies and accounting standards as need be, test and certify the resulting systems, and manage their evolution as vulnerabilities are discovered or as their requirements change over time.Over the course of 15 lectures we will study how real systems are attacked by a variety of opponents and how their defences evolve to cope. We will look in detail at important applications such as payments, home automation and vehicles. We will look at the psychology of secure design: how we can minimise the risk of attacks involving deception. We will analyse the economics of security: when service providers have adequate incentives to prevent fraud, and where market failure or poor regulation get in the way.We will take a deep dive into the protection mechanisms of the underlying platforms, from smartcards through mobile phones to containers, and at whole ecosystems such as phone apps, cloud services and network security. By the end of the course, students should be able to analyse a security problem across the entire systems stack, from the threats and protection goals down through the application and the platforms and if need be to the hardware. They should also appreciate how security interacts with related emergent properties such as safety and sustainability.",

We will then consider how standards and regulation influence requirements and the requirements gathering process.  Then consider tools and techniques that can be deployed to provide evidence of compliance.  Finally we consider the full process from the initiation of development to the eventual decommissioning of the system.We consider:- Standards and regulation: Here we consider a range of standards and regulation such as the MISRA C/C++ coding standard, the emerging EU AI regulations, Medical Device Standards such as EN 62304, Avionics (DO-178C), Process Control (IEC 61508) and others, including Security standards- Requirements gathering: Here we consider practices like hazard and risk analysis, performance requirements, conformance to rules, and how the compliance requirement influences and is incorporated into the more general requirements process- Evidence supporting compliance:  Here we look at tools and techniques that support the generation of evidence that the system complies with these include standard architectures, testing, static analysers, verifiers, and others- Processes for compliant systems:  increasingly systems continuously evolve as they are modified in use (not all standards admit the possibility of evolution).  Here we consider the range of approaches to process from the rigid v-model to modern system development practice and how different processes organise the production of compliance evidenceClass members will work in small groups taking a case study as their focus. Groups will be guided to provide a documented analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, potential for improvement and sustainability of the system and associated compliance-demonstrating processes. This work will be available to other class members as part of the learning materials of the course.  Each class member will also develop a portfolio demonstrating they have individually achieved the learning outcomes of the course. This will be based on work included in the analysis of the case study augmented by appropriate other evidence. Acceptable kinds of evidence demonstrating achievement of the learning outcomes are diverse so part of the assessment is the design of the portfolio in advance of its construction.  There are two or three 'standard' portfolio designs but class members are encouraged to develop their own approaches that take account of their personal strengths and weaknesses.  Portfolio designs will include assessment criteria. Each week there will be a group meeting, around 1-2 hours of recorded material covering the lecture material in the course and a guest lecture given by a practitioner on their experience of working with standards compliant systems.",

In the best case, failure is just annoying, in the worst case, it costs lives.In this course, we will look at the art and craft of building technical systems that people can actually use successfully. To this end, we will draw on relevant findings from anthropology; behavioural, cognitive and social psychology; human-computer interaction; and sociology. The course will be taught using a flipped classroom - before class, you will work through materials; in class, we will work on activities designed to review the material and deepen your learning.",

Similarly, the ability understand the structure and meanings of data, and communicate this while maintaining awareness of the social context from which the data came is a key part of working in this field.Through a series of lectures and workshops, you will be supported in developing a computational mindset, learning the tools of software carpentry, and developing a competence in writing and managing software. Building on this, you will develop an understanding of data, from the microformats used in individual fields to tools for engaging with large datasets. This includes: simple descriptive statistics; exploratory visual analysis; finding, combining and relating datasets (data wrangling); and an understanding of Open Data; and how to draw inferences from data. Data visualisation will be used for both exploration and presentation, drawing on techniques from data journalism. Alongside this, you will build up an understanding of the ways in which data relates to the world: the social and political structures of its collection and use, personal data, aesthetics and communication of findings.Bringing this together around a particular problem will help you to understand how to collaboratively create software around data, and how to work with a problem holder to collect, analyse and present data sets of social relevance.This course will:1.\tGive a solid grounding in programming with Python, version control with Git and github and other key software practices.2.\tDevelop a comprehensive understanding of data formats, their wrangling and management, including CSV and relational databases (SQL)3.\tDevelop skills in the analysis and visualisation of a range of data using descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis.4.\tIntroduce you to the socio-political ramifications of data collection and use.5.\tIntroduce rich collaborative practices around data collection, analysis and presentation.",

The course provides students with an introduction to contemporary design methods involving data collection, analysis and synthesis in a social context.  It involves students working in teams to construct and develop design proposals using methods of data collection involving existing datasets, data collected by machines, and data collected from people through social engagement in partnership with Edinburgh Living Lab.The course is predicated on Simon's (1969) definition of design as Â¿...courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones ...Â¿  Through a combination of lectures and workshops, students will explore a range of design methods including ethnographic observation and participatory methods, identifying and understanding personas, roles and relationships of various project stakeholders,i user mapping, physical prototyping, design probes and the use of appropriate design assessment criteria.   The course continues by looking at contemporary design processes including the Â¿double diamondÂ¿ , a design process method  involving  four steps:  Discover, Define, Develop and Deliver. External speakers, from a range of backgrounds and disciplines will offer lectures and seminars on their methods, processes and challenges in working with data in context. Particular focus will be paid to the field of interaction design and the advent of digital media upon the design process. The course demands students synthesise a team based design project with an understanding of an iterative method / process, supported by evidence of research.",

    "summary": "The course, offered in Semester 2, offers a challenge-led context in which to explore the cultural and technical implications of developing solutions that integrate digital network technologies with established design methodologies. The course introduces the concept of a dualism between the material and immaterial nature of things and experiences. Through a combination of lectures, skills-based sessions and tutorials the course will support a contemporary enquiry into what design with data might be. The lecture series will provide a critical framework, investigating the impact of technology upon traditional understandings of material objects, its relationship to meaning, value, its social role, and how technology allows for an extension of this thinking into the digital realm across a range of subjects.",
    "course_description": "A series of practical sessions will support the development of a piece of coursework, whose outcome will be an experimental construction in both digital and physical media that responds to the challenge theme of the course. Students will be encouraged to record research material as a portfolio or URL.",
