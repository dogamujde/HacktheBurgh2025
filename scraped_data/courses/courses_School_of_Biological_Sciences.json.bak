    "summary": "We aim to reinforce and extend your knowledge of biochemical techniques (especially in so-called 'wet biochemistry') and to introduce you to new physical techniques in selected fields of current interest (especially those of relevance in structural biology). In the 'wet biochemistry' section the aim is to give you insight into selecting the simplest effective approach for solving the biochemical problem in hand.  In the 'structural techniques' section we shall show how the answers to many fascinating questions in biology can be obtained by applying physical chemical techniques.  Application of these techniques now in everyday use, has improved in recent years so that the scientist is relatively free to concentrate on the biology of the problem rather than the collection of the data needed to consider the problem.  A major advance in this regard is the relatively straightforward means by which an accurate 3-D structure can be obtained.  The aim of this section, then, is to review some of the methods by which biomolecular structure is determined, how these methods combine to give a full picture of the structure and function of the biological system under study, which can be a single subunit, a whole molecule or a more complex assembly, and thereby show why such knowledge is an essential part of modern biochemistry, molecular biology and pharmacology.",

    "summary": "About a third of an organism\u00c2\u00bfs genes encode membrane proteins or enzymes involved in the biochemistry of membrane lipids, reflecting the fundamental importance of membranes in every living cell. Membranes serve to compartmentalise cell functions by isolating different biochemical processes, but membranes and lipids also function in cell signalling and regulation. Though much has been learned about biochemical pathways involved in membrane biogenesis, details of how organelle membranes assemble and achieve particular shapes and compositions remain elusive. The significant percentage of the genome associated with membrane biology implies likewise that we have only viewed the tip of the iceberg with regard to regulatory functions of lipids.The Membrane Biology module begins with a general overview of the breadth of membranes and associated proteins followed by allocation of the projects for the In Course Assessment (ICA; see below). Most course lectures will combine textbook-style information with a description of methods used to gain that information. Using a combination of biochemical and cell biological approaches, we then explore emerging structures and mechanisms, including proteins involved in fusion and fission membrane interactions of viruses and the cell\u00c2\u00bfs own endocytic and exocytic processes. Lipid modifications, membrane diffusion, and evolution of membrane bending mechanisms will also be discussed.The module also includes one Research Talk and current paper awareness (CPA) sessions (titles to be announced). The ICA will take place in the middle of November. Each student will give a 5 minute oral presentation on diseases associated with biological lipids and membranes followed by 5 minutes for a question and answer/ discussion. The ability to answer questions in the discussion will be as important as the presentation for the mark, and active participation in the discussion of others\u00c2\u00bf presentations will also form part of the assessment. The ICA will be worth 20% of the course total.",

After DNA is transcribed and translated, we consider how nascent protein sequences are folded.  We will also look at the roles of natively unstructured proteins.In the protein world information is transmitted by interactions between molecules. In this context we will consider the protein-protein interactions underpinning accurate control of cell division, as well as protein-carbohydrate interactions involved in disease, and the exploitation of these in drug discovery. Finally we will consider how post-translational modifications of proteins can be detected and how they can enhance or alter a protein's function.",

We examine theories for the evolution of multi-cellular life, and for the diversification of body plans and life histories among the major groups.The second section on Marine Biology considers the ecology and behaviour of these invertebrate groups in marine environments. We focus on life cycles, feeding and locomotion, with special reference to adaptations for life in the open ocean, on the sea bed, and in the intertidal zone.The third section on the Origin and Diversification of Vertebrates considers the origin of vertebrates and their diversification through the major radiations of reptiles, birds and mammals. The fourth section focuses on the Biology of Mammals as an example of a single taxon of animals showing great variation in form and function within a single general body plan.The final Animal Associations section examines the ecology and adaptation of parasitic animals, and evolutionary interactions with their hosts.Throughout, the lectures incorporate behaviour and ecology as well as morphology and phylogeny.Throughout, the lectures incorporate behaviour and ecology as well as morphology and phylogeny. Practical work and films are used to illustrate the lectures and to introduce students to hands-on study of animal diversity and adaptive radiation.

Student teams will then choose a project topic to investigate, reporting their results orally and as a written report. Workshops and practicals will help develop skills. A programme of lectures will deal with the following five major questions, across different levels of biological organisation:- Why are species found where they are? (Distribution)- Why are big fierce animals rare on a green planet? (Abundance)- How do communities change? (Communities)- What happens when the forests go? (Ecosystems)- How do we save the world?

This knowledge is expanded by discussing core biological concepts in more detail at molecular, cellular and organism level, with special attention paid to how these levels are interconnected.Using circadian clock as the overarching case study, students will learn about structure and function of proteins and nucleic acids, cellular compartmentalisation, metabolic processes inside the cell, how cells sense the outside world, how they organise into tissues and how they communicate at the level of organism. The course will build on and expand skills in biochemistry, molecular and cell biology and physiology.",

    "graduate_attributes_and_skills": "The University has identified six groups of abilities, listed below, that should be developed as part of the University of Edinburgh training experience, and to enhance your employability as a graduate. These abilities take your skill-base beyond simply academic knowledge and are enhanced at each stage of your degree.Knowledge and Understanding: This course is designed to provide a high degree of knowledge of the diversity of living organisms and how they function.  It aims to provide an understanding of how evolution has generated the diversity that we see today, by covering the subjects listed above.Research and Enquiry: This course provides an introduction to the process of scientific research and enquiry.  Support for this is provided in Workshops, which will teach you how to locate and identify primary sources of information (research papers), to cite in your work.  This is a vital skill for any scientist. In addition, practical sessions will introduce students to the art of hands-on research and enquiry, and the vital skill of keeping a detailed record of ideas, observations, results and conclusions obtained in the lab.Communication: This is a critical attribute for all scientists \u00c2\u00bf there is no point conducting excellent research if no one else ever hears about it.  In this course we will instruct you in the crucial art of scientific writing: how to communicate your thoughts, ideas and discoveries clearly and concisely, and how to incorporate sources into your writing.  Your first write-up will receive detailed feedback, which will give you further instruction on how to improve your work.Technical and Practical Skills:  Any successful scientist combines an intellectual understanding of his or her topic with the technical skills required to carry out research.  These skills can be broken down into the physical skills to generate data, and the ability to analyse that data.  Physical skills such as observation, microscopy and dissection are taught, together with good and safe practice, in the series of practicals throughout the course.  Data analysis is touched on in most of the practicals and Workshops, with a particular focus during the genetics section of the course.  All of these skills will be vital in subsequent courses, and will serve you well in any future career.Personal Effectiveness: At University, every student is responsible for their own learning.  The job of staff is to provide teaching materials in the form of lectures, practicals, Workshops and online resources; however it is the responsibility of the student to convert these into an understanding of the topics covered.  Hence you will need to develop skills in recording information in a way that captures the key points, and will be useful for you at a later date.  Workshops and practicals will help you with this.  For all University courses you will need to manage your time effectively, which means first getting to your classes, and second being awake enough to get something from them when you are there.  Time management will also be crucial as your assignment deadline approaches \u00c2\u00bf to do yourself justice with an assignment like this, it is vital to give yourself sufficient time to complete and proofread your paper, as those written at the last minute never do the writer justice.  You are at this University because you have shown tremendous potential, and good time management is one way to ensure that your potential is realised, both at University and in whatever you choose to do afterwards.Personal and Intellectual Autonomy: The single most important skill for a scientist, or anyone working in a field connected to science, is critical thinking.  Hence while learning established facts and theories is an essential part of your training, you must also begin to learn how to test and challenge accepted ideas.  Theories such as evolution stand strong precisely because they have survived such challenges.  Hence we will encourage you to investigate for yourself whatever you are being taught. If something does not appear to make sense, try to find out why \u00c2\u00bf this will deepen your understanding of the topic.  Lecturers will not always present hard facts \u00c2\u00bf sometimes, instead, they will present to you an unproven hypothesis, or questions that are not yet answered.  These are opportunities for you to form your own opinions, but remember that opinions only become facts when backed by hard evidence!",

Your lecturers are research scientists active in the field with cutting-edge knowledge of the material they deliver. They will share their enthusiasm for understanding biology at a fundamental level.You will gain experience of research and enquiry in the practical sessions, by tackling the assessed problem, by engaging with your tutors and demonstrators, and by reading around the topics in your lectures.You will develop personal and intellectual autonomy that will enhance your capacity for life-long and independent learning through studying for the multiple-choice test based on the self-taught material in the Appendix of this course book, through preparing for tutorials, and through the work involved in successfully addressing question set as part of the assessed problem.We encourage you to develop the communication skills essential for every scientist via working as pairs or groups in practical sessions or tutorials, and through participating in the discussion page on the course Learn site when you undertake the assessed problem.You will also have the opportunity to hone your writing skills when summarising the science in the assessed problem.This course has multiple components, some running in parallel, and you will need to organise and summarise your thoughts and material in a flexible and accessible way thus helping you developing the tools needed to maximise your personal effectiveness.In the practical sessions we will teach you modern experimental methods, the rudiments of experimental design, data recording and analysis and interpretation skills, good laboratory practice and awareness of health and safety; thus equipping you with technical and practical skills that are required by many employers.",
    "special_arrangements": "It is possible, upon request,  for TDC students to avoid being assigned to TDC classes after 13.50 on Weds.Note: it is NOT possible for TDC students to have any commitments between 10.00 and 13.00 on Weds.",
    "additional_class_delivery_information": "Timetabled Online Teaching Sessions:There will be a total of 33 fifty-minute timetabled, \u00c2\u00bfonline teaching sessions\u00c2\u00bf in TDC. These replace the in-person lectures of a traditional university course. Most of these sessions will consist of either pre-recorded lectures that are made available according to the timetable or live-streamed lectures (that will be recorded). The 33 sessions are divided into six \u00c2\u00bflecture blocks\u00c2\u00bf: one block of three sessions, in week 1, and then five two-week blocks of six sessions each. Each block will include at least one \u00c2\u00bflive\u00c2\u00bf session or part-session(s) in which students will be encouraged to interact with the lecturer (and each other) online, in real time, by asking questions or seeking clarifications. The format of a block will vary according to how the lecturer feels it is best to deliver their material. For example, some lecturers have decided to give shorter \u00c2\u00bfmini-lectures\u00c2\u00bf interspersed with engagement activities, while others wished to deliver full-length lectures. The five six-session blocks (weeks 2-11) will each be assessed by a formal \u00c2\u00bfopen book\u00c2\u00bf test or exercise, released at the end of the second week of the block. Your answers to these will be formally assessed and will count towards your course mark.The Assessed Exercise:The Assessed Exercise is a significant constituent of TDC and you must allow plenty of time to complete each Section. You will undertake the Assessed Exercise working on your own or with other TDC students, although you must submit your own answers in your own words. The material needed for the Assessed Exercise will be released in four Sections (numbered 0 to 3) throughout the course and each Section should be completed by you and submitted by you before the appropriate deadline. There will be four timetabled online (and recorded) preview/feedback sessions associated with the Assessed Exercise in which we aim to discuss both the previous Section (work already submitted) and the current Section (work to be submitted). We hope these will be interactive and we will be encouraging questions and comments.Your answers to the questions embedded within the Assessed Exercise Sections 1-3 will be assessed and your mark for each Section will count towards your course mark. The Assessed Exercise Introduction (Section 0) will be accompanied by a peer-marking exercise. After submitting your own answers to the questions in Section 0, you will be allocated scripts submitted by two other students and will grade these anonymously online. You will also be asked to provide anonymous feedback to these students. Subsequently you will reconcile the marks you have awarded with those awarded by another peer marker (this is called double marking).Completion of Section 0 and participation in peer-marking will prepare you for the formally assessed components of the Assessed Exercise (Section 1-3). Peer marking will help you think about questions such as the following:What factors does a marker consider when assessing a script and why are these important?What is it, specifically, that students who receive a top mark for a piece of work do to deserve that high mark?Do I understand why my own answer was assessed in a particular way (whether or not I agree with the assessment)?In short, you will get a sense of what makes a well-received versus a poorly received answer. More important than maximising your marks, you will begin to develop a more rounded perspective of the assessment process and its aims. Being able to assess and provide effective feedback to others is a lifelong skill which will also develop your self-assessment skills.More information will be made available on Learn about this exercise.The Lab Skills Session:We understand that due to the disruptions caused by the pandemic, your practical experience in Year 1 was limited. We have therefore organised additional small-group laboratory skills session in weeks 1-3, which will introduce you to the basics of lab work such as pipetting and the use of a spectrophotometer. For these sessions, you will be divided into 14 groups and each group will spend 60 min in the lab. This will be your opportunity to familiarise yourself with the lab space and core lab skills, and ask any questions you may have before embarking on the more complex laboratory practical exercise described below. Before attending your lab skills session, you should watch the video introducing the session, read through the lab skills protocol (a hard copy will be provided in the lab for you to take away with you) and watch the 3 videos explaining the use of some lab equipment (filmed in the lab), all of which are available on Learn.The Laboratory Practical Exercise:The class will be split into 12 groups so make sure you know which group you are in and when your three-hour session is timetabled (two sessions will run on Wednesdays in each of weeks 4-9). It is essential that you attend and you must sign in. You should write up the experiment according to the structured template to be provided and submit your own work for assessment by the appropriate deadline. Your mark for this work will count towards your course mark. A follow-up session for this practical will be offered in triplicate and will be scheduled to take place as soon as possible after your laboratory session but before your submission deadline.Other Sessions:In addition to the timetabled online teaching, assessed exercise preview/feedback and laboratory-practical review sessions, there are several additional entries in the timetable. Early on in this course you must complete the online Multiple-Choice Test on Biological Chemistry Basics and submit your answers after which we will hold a feedback session to go through model answers. There will be a live online PyMOL session (with tutors available to address queries) that you are very strongly advised to attend as this will help you answer an associated test (that you must complete, but which will not be formally assessed).",

We will provide students with a modern view of animal diversity and an understanding of how the process of evolution has produced this diversity. Students will examine what key features make animals different from the rest of life and the evolutionary significance of these features. They will then explore this diversity from different perspectives, including the phylogenetic description of diversity, the general causes of diversification in animals and more detailed examination of the diversification of key animal traits such as immunity, physiology and life-history. They will examine how patterns of diversity at different levels of biological organisation, from genetic diversity within populations to species diversity patterns across the globe can be understood. They will examine how the diversity of body plans can be understood in terms of the relationship between evolution and development. The course will finish by considering the future of animal diversity.

    "graduate_attributes_and_skills": "The University has identified six groups of abilities (see headings below) that should be developed as part of the University of Edinburgh training experience, and to enhance you employability as a graduate for the 21st Century. These abilities take your skill-base beyond simply academic knowledge and are enhanced at each stage of your degree. They relate to Behavioural Ecology 3  in a number of specific ways, as outlined below.1) Knowledge and Understanding: Lectures, practicals and data analysis sessions are designed to give you a broad knowledge base in the field of behavioural ecology. This includes a history of the development of the subject, the key theories proposed and a wide range of examples of the classic studies that underlie them \u00c2\u00bfboth how they were done and what they found. This University considers itself to be a research-led Institution and you will be exposed to cutting edge information and ideas being published in the area as you progress through your course. However, you will also develop a sound understanding of how research in the field is conducted, evaluated, analysed, presented and assessed.2) Research and Enquiry: You will be asked to build on your lecture and practical material and research current developments in the field for critical appraisal and analysis. Understanding how to use Web of Knowledge will be one important aspect en route to surveying current and past scientific arguments and the relative strength of support for competing hypotheses.3) Personal and Intellectual Autonomy: By reading and preparing materials for practical sessions, you will learn to synthesise your own views, develop reasoned arguments and further refine your scientific judgement. In addition in this course we encourage self-development through use of self-study exercises designed to prepare you with skills that will come later in your course.  Such skills will enhance your capacity for life-long and independent learning.4) Communication: This is a key attribute of all scientists and it is therefore important that you develop skills to interact constructively with others and convey knowledgeable and balanced scientific views. Our presentation and discussion assessments and feedback play a key role in developing these skills.5) Personal Effectiveness The ability to organise and summarise your thoughts and material in a flexible and accessible way are core features that are required for personal effectiveness.  Planning, time management and reflection are central to this. Of course these features also interlink with your personal and intellectual autonomy. By providing you with a timetable where key submission dates are highlighted, we are encouraging you to develop your effectiveness throughout this course.6) Technical and Practical Skills.In order to continue in a scientific career it is important that you not only understand the conceptual basis of how experiments are designed and carried out but also that you have the practical techniques to do this. Your practical training on this course provides skills in basic data collection methods in the behavioural sciences and how these types of data can then be analysed and conveyed. The skills you develop from your practical sessions, in critical observation, investigation and interpretation, careful recording, quantification and analysis, should serve you well in any future employment.",

The graduate attributes we hope you will develop during the Biotechnology 3 course are indicated below:Research and enquiryThis course aims to increase your understanding of the subject area and also obtain the specific skills as outlined in the \u00c2\u00bflearning outcomes\u00c2\u00bf above. The knowledge obtained, and the development of research and technical skills will be of benefit to you in completion of your degree and beyond. The course will also develop your ability to read and critique scientific papers, and your data analysis and problem solving capabilities through the tutorials and practicals. In-course assessment will enable you to evaluate scientific information and make critical judgements and considered conclusions from your scientific enquiries.Personal and intellectual autonomyWe encourage students to work independently to meet the challenges of the course but also to strengthen your views by discussion and debate with other students. By exploring textbooks and research papers you can not only expand your knowledge of the topics covered in the lectures but also this will allow you to broaden your own personal scientific interests outside of the specific subjects in the course. In writing the course essay you can explore a topic in detail, evaluate what you have read in a critical way and provide your own summary, interpretation and conclusions. Preparation for the tutorials and full participation in these will improve your intellectual confidence and flexibility through trying to understand, evaluate and discuss new information.CommunicationThrough discussion and collaboration with students in practical and tutorial groups you will be able to communicate your views and ideas and to learn from your peers. You are also encouraged to ask questions to your lecturers, practical demonstrators and tutors to expand your knowledge and clear up any misinterpretations you might have.Personal effectivenessTransferable skills acquired throughout your degree programme will benefit you, not only across the courses on which you are enrolled, but in future employment and further study. In this course, as in others, time management is an important skill that you will acquire as you develop ways to organise your work and meet deadlines. Group work in tutorials and practicals is also an important transferable skill and by interacting with fellow students you will become aware of your own skills, talents and limitations; and appreciate those of others.",

It considers the development of many types of animal and plant embryos and also post-embryonic process (control of growth, tissue maintenance, flowering, etc). Major sections of the course include pattern formation (cell lineage, cell interaction); control of gene expression; genetic analysis in zebrafish and in Drosophila (the oocyte, the embryo and imaginal discs); mammalian development; plant development.  The course consists of lectures, laboratory practicals, small-group seminars and data-analysis sessions.",
    "course_description": "The study of development is central to modern biology. It is revealing how multi-cellular organisms form the correct cells, tissues and organs in the right place at the right time, to generate a complex and functional organism. Combining manipulative, genetic and molecular approaches, Developmental Biology allows us to understand the path from genes to organism. Analysis in different species has shown that a surprisingly similar 'toolkit' of developmental mechanisms is used in vertebrate and invertebrate animals and in plants (albeit often using different gene products as the 'tools'). The Developmental Biology 3 course aims to give a broad view of the processes and mechanisms of development in a range of important research organisms.An understanding of development is not only crucial to appreciating how the whole, functional organism is formed, but also to understanding what happens when things go wrong, as in congenital abnormalities or in cancer.We encourage you to go on to Development, Regeneration and Stem Cell Honours in your final year. The Honours programme builds on this 3rd year course, going in more detail into experiments on developmental mechanisms - at levels from embryology and morphogenesis to the molecular control of gene expression, and in many different organisms. We also cover important additional topics such as stem cell biology, human developmental genetics, developmental neurobiology and the evolution of development (what is shared and what is unique to different organisms, from humans to plants). Developmental Biology is truly interdisciplinary, with input from the Science and Medical areas - it is an exciting and intriguing topic and the research career prospects are good.",

    "summary": "The course covers aspects of the acclimation and adaptation of land plants to diverse environmental stresses, both biotic and physical; competition and niche capture by plants; the origin, evolution and biodiversity of land plants; their reproductive and breeding mechanisms; and their anatomy.  The course will introduce a comparison of morphological, physiological and molecular approaches to study the ecology and evolution of plants. Plant-environment interactions also feature in the context of the colonisation of the land by early plants.  We hope that the course will make clear the close linkage between the evolution and ecology of plants - past and present, wild or cultivated.",
    "course_description": "The radiation of land plants over the last 475 million years transformed Earth to the green planet we know today. Land plants have not simply survived during this time but have instead thrived, leading to a plethora of botanical form spanning minute mosses, creeping lycophytes and ferns, towering gymnosperms and flamboyant flowering plants.The aim for the course is to provide an overview of this remarkable radiation. This will be done by focussing in on some of the key anatomical, physiological and genetic changes that have underpinned the diversity of land plants. We will also consider how some of these traits and innovations enable plants to acclimate and adapt to different environments.Telling this story requires an interdisciplinary approach spanning the investigation of fossil plants, living plants and genetic networks. At the beginning of the course, we will introduce some tools and processes that can help us frame the evolution and ecology of organisms, plant included. Fossil plants will be examined in the collections of the National Museum of Scotland. The diversity of living plant species will be explored at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. Plant anatomy and genetic networks will be covered in lectures and practicals.The course will therefore provide a broad overview of plant evolution through time, set out how lessons from the past can reveal information about the future and highlight some of the remaining outstanding questions in the study of plant evolution. The course will also make clear the link between the evolution and ecology of plants (past and present).Recommended second year courses for EEP3 include: Biology 2B: Genetics and Evolution, Biology 2C: Systems and Regulation and The Green Planet 2. The course counts directly towards Honours degrees in Biological Sciences (Plant Science) and is one of a selection of courses recommended for Biological Sciences (Ecology) and Biological Sciences (Evolutionary Biology). It is also useful background for students of other programmes.This course book contains answers to some of the questions you may have about course content, timetabling and assessment.

    "course_description": "Field Zoology 3 runs on Wednesday mornings in Semester 2, with a one-week residential field course in Millport, Isle of Cumbrae, during the Easter break (usually the first week of the vacation - check before making your plans for the vacation).The Wednesday morning slot consists of 2-3 hour sessions until the Easter break. During these sessions, a series of case studies from a wide variety of field systems will be examined through lectures and group problem-solving exercises. In preparation for the field course, there will also be lectures on the marine and coastal system and on experimental design. There will also be a practical where students get experience of matching experimental design and statistical analysis.The first two days of the field course are based around the collection and identification of specimens from different marine environments to teach diversity, higher-order systematics and diversity gradients. During the second part of the field course, students undertake a group project to answer a specific set of questions using a combination of field and/or laboratory studies on field-caught specimens. A wide range of habitats on the island is used for these projects. At the end of the week, groups present their results to the class and after the field course students write individual project reports for assessment. Throughout, the emphasis is on how to solve novel problems in the context of field studies and on the wide range of techniques which may be applied.Assessment is based on project work and an exam that includes assessment of the case studies covered during semester.Requirement for Ecology Honours and Zoology Honours.

    "graduate_attributes_and_skills": "The University of Edinburgh has identified six attributes (see below) that you should develop during your education to enhance your employability as a graduate for the 21st century. These attributes take your skill-base beyond basic academic knowledge, and the ways by which you will develop these attributes in Field Zoology 3 is outlined below:1) Knowledge and understanding: The course will provide you with comprehensive knowledge about the planning and design of field experiments, and about animals and plants that live in the marine and coastal system. The case studies will provide you with knowledge about experimental design and methodology applied to specific field systems, while the lectures will provide you with general knowledge about experimental design and the marine and coastal system. The fieldcourse will, among other things, provide you with knowledge about traditional and modern molecular methods used to identify animals, techniques and metholodology used in field research, and the animals and plants that live in the marine and coastal system.2) Research and enquiry: The course will provide you with comprehensive knowledge about the planning and design of research projects, and the collection and statistical analyses of field data. The case studies will allow you to gain experience in developing experimental designs and thinking about the choice of appropriate methodologies through group discussions centrered on specific zoological problems and particular field systems. The fieldcourse will provide you with further experience on the planning and design of research projects and the collection of data in a group research project based on animals and plants living in the marine and coastal system. Furthermore, you will learn about research by reading books, research papers and electronic materials. These readings will support your lecture material and will also underpin your ICA during and after the fieldcourse. Such skills will among other things help you prepare for the Senior Honours year in Zoology.3) Personal and intellectual autonomy: You will learn to synthesise your own views, develop reasoned arguments and refine your scientific judgement by reading the course materials and by engaging in group discussions. Such skills will enhance your capacity for life-long and independent learning.4) Communication: Communication is a key attribute of all scientists and it is therefore important that you develop such skills to convey knowledge and balanced scientific views to others. You will get experience in oral presentation skills during the case studies and at the fieldcourse, while you will get experience in written presentation skills when you write up your project report after the fieldcourse. This project report is based on the data that you collected while doing the group projects during the fieldcourse. Such skills will enhance your capacity for communication whilst studying at the university, and will be helpful in your future career whether in science or elsewhere.5) Personal effectiveness: Planning, time management and reflection are central aspects of your personal effectiveness. You will learn these skills while conducting the group projects during the fieldcourse, and when writing up the project report after the fieldcourse. The writing of the project report requires that you work towards a submission date highlighted in the timetable below. Such skills will help improve your overall ability to maximise your achievement whilst studying at the university, and will also be helpful for other aspects of your current and future life.6) Technical and practical skills: In order to continue in a scientific career it is important that you not only understand the conceptual basis of how experiments are designed and carried out but also that you have the underpinning practical skills required for employability. During the fieldcourse, you will learn practical field skills, basic molecular techniques and safe conduct during fieldwork. Such skills will assist you in your future Honours course projects and will also be valuable in any future employment.",

Technologies to produce sequence data continue to improve, increasing speed and decreasing cost, so genomic data is now an important part of many research projects. Many of the genes identified in these sequences are still of unknown function and there is a strong drive to develop new methods, both experimental and computer based, that offer the prospect of having complete catalogues of the biochemical or genetic function of every gene in an organism. This information will ultimately provide the basis for understanding living systems and the evolution of organisms at the most fundamental level, with important implications in practical applications in biotechnology and human health. Already knowledge gained from genomics is influencing the way we do science.In this course we introduce and review the development and prospects for genomic analysis. There are three components to the course: a lecture series, computer-based bioinformatics workshops and a practical.In the lectures, through the presentation of key genomes, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, we consider the structure, function and evolution of genomes. We then look at tools, both experimental and statistical, to further our knowledge of genes and their function. We conclude with examples of applications of genomics.In bioinformatics workshops we provide a grounding in important skills for the handling and analysis of sequence data.The practical gives the opportunity to generate and investigate novel genome sequences. We start in a wet laboratory with DNA isolation and preparation of a genome sequencing library for submission to Edinburgh Genomics.

It will take you on an exciting journey through cellular function, physiology, experimental systems and key techniques to study immunology and diagnose infections and immunological diseases.The first half of the lecture course describes basic concepts in immunology, including description of the innate and adaptive immune systems, the anatomy of the immune system and an overview of the recognition mechanisms by which foreign antigens are detected. There is an emphasis here on the genetic mechanisms that contribute to the generation of antigen receptor diversity, and the ways in which antigens are handled by antigen-presenting cells. The lectures then move on to look at lymphocyte development and activation, as well as the specific effector functions of the cellular and humoral arms of the adaptive immune system. The regulation of responses by 'helper' T cells and cytokines, and the principles of immunological memory are discussed in some depth. Understanding how the immune system tolerates self-antigens and harmless foreign antigen is discussed, providing a basis for understanding autoimmune diseases.  Finally, the immune system will be discussed in the context of evolutionary biology.Both theoretical and practical aspects of the course will be assessed.

The course focuses on the fundamental biological processes that underpin these interactions, from the viewpoint of both the host and the pathogen. Students will gain a comprehensive understanding of how pathogens evade the immune response and the virulence factors they employ. Further, practical workshops will complement the theoretical knowledge by exploring research culture,ethics, and essential experimental techniques used in infection and immunity research. Through hands-on experience with data analysis and scientific inquiry, students will develop critical thinking, communication, and teamwork skills.",
    "course_description": "Infection and Immunity 3 offers a rigorous exploration of host-pathogen interactions, emphasising immune evasion mechanisms and pathogen virulence factors. The course delves into the underlying biological principles that govern these interactions rather than the clinical impact of disease. In the course, students will actively engage in workshops on topics critical in biological research; such as research ethics, the Three Rs principle, and managing conflicting data. Further, students will research a range of experimental techniques commonly used in the field, creating a Techniques Poster. This knowledge will be extended by analysing primary data, formulating hypotheses, and proposing new experiments by developing a Mini-data Report. Through these, students will develop critical thinking, communication, and teamwork skills. In summary, the course will use a synoptic approach that integrates infection biology and immunology, which will allow students to explore cutting-edge research in host-pathogen interactions.",

    "graduate_attributes_and_skills": "Knowledge and understanding: the lectures provide the framework to develop a comprehensive knowledge of core concepts in infection and immunity with a focus on host pathogen interactions,and of the approaches to investigate it. Most of the lecturing staff on the course run active research programmes and the material covered will often be based on lecturers research activities, providing cutting edge information and ideas.Research and Enquiry: These skills are enhanced by encouraging further reading of books, research papers and electronic materials, to deepen knowledge and understanding of core concepts. They underpin the Techniques Poster (ICA1) and the Mini Data Report (ICA2). The students will investigate various experimental techniques, interrogate datasets and visualise their findings. Using this information students will also formulate further questions that follow up on the data analysis, providing real experience in hypothesis-driven analysis.Personal and Intellectual Autonomy: The students will autonomously formulate a follow up experiment and with aims and hypotheses as part of the mini data report (ICA2). Writing of a data report will require students to use their scientific judgement, synthesise their own views and visualise data in an appropriate manner. They will also need to develop reasoned arguments to relate the data to the wider context. The tutorial sessions also provide an opportunity to apply their knowledge in a synoptic manner, and to build upon their research readiness through discussions around research ethics.Communication: During the course students will develop written, oral and visual communication via creating of a poster, a mini data report and a final exam with a mix of long and short answer questions. Students will be encouraged to provide peer-feedback during the creation of their posters. This will help students develop communication skills to interact constructively with others, providing feedback respectfully and being able to consider and act upon feedback received. Interactions with lecturers and tutors throughout the course will provide further opportunities to develop communication and interpersonal skills.Personal Effectiveness: Students will work on their personal effectiveness skills when organising their time to meet the deadlines of the course and when deciding how to communicate their results and ideas in the peer feedback session and poster presentation.Technical Skills: Students will develop numeracy and data handling skills in the data analysis assignment, contributing to graduate employability. Critical observation, careful recording, investigation and interpretation, quantification and analysis are all skills that will be helpful for the Honours year and for future employment.",

    "graduate_attributes_and_skills": "The University has identified a set of four clusters of skills and abilities (see headings below) that we would like students to develop throughout their degree programme to strengthen your attitude towards lifelong learning and personal development, as well as future employability. The graduate attributes we hope to develop within Molecular Cell Biology 3 are indicated below.Research and EnquiryThe course aims to increase your understanding of the general subject area and also obtain specific skills as outlined in the course Aims and Objectives. The knowledge base of the course and the development of research and technical skills will be of benefit to you in completing your degree and beyond. The course will develop research and problem-solving capabilities through the Lab Practical and Web-based projects and through the Hypothetical Research Project.Personal and Intellectual AutonomyTo meet the objectives and challenges of the course, we encourage students both to work independently and also to discuss and debate with other students to strengthen your views as they develop. By reading textbooks and research papers you will expand your knowledge of the topics covered in the lectures, and this will allow you to broaden your own personal scientific interests outside of the specific subjects in the course. In writing the Hypothetical Research Project you will explore a topic in detail, evaluate what you have read in a critical way and provide your own approach to investigating and solving a biological problem.CommunicationThrough discussion and collaboration with students in the tutorials, Lab Practical and Mitotic Oscillator project you will be able to communicate your views and ideas and to learn from your peers. Preparing for your presentations at tutorials will help you to develop effective communication skills. You are also encouraged to ask questions from your lecturers, practical demonstrators and tutors to expand your knowledge and clear up any misinterpretations you might have. There is also a course Discussion Board on Learn which can be used to obtain feedback and to discuss various aspects of the course.Personal EffectivenessThroughout your degree programme you will learn transferable skills that will benefit you not only across the courses you are enrolled in but in future employment and further study. In this course, as in others, time management is an important skill you will learn as you must develop ways to organise your work and meet deadlines. Writing a well-reasoned Hypothetical Research Project will help you to organize your thoughts succinctly and effectively. Group work in the Lab Practical and the Mitotic Oscillator project is also an important transferable skill. By interacting with fellow students you will become aware of your own skills and talents (and your possible limitations) and appreciate those of others.",

    "summary": "Molecular Microbiology provides insight into the fascinating diversity of microorganisms and how they interact with their environment. Many of these interactions are of great benefit to man (e.g. for yoghurt and beer production), as well as harmful (e.g. infectious pathogens). The course explores the basic theory behind several of the most important microbial processes and examines how they operate at a molecular level. The course also has a substantial practical component which is designed to highlight the properties of living microorganisms in action. These practical sessions are aimed primarily at demonstrating how microorganisms can be characterised, controlled or harnessed.",
    "course_description": "The underlying aim of Molecular Microbiology 3 is to provide deeper insight into how microorganisms work at the molecular level. Microorganisms are the most abundant life forms on the planet, as well as the largest natural reservoir of genetic material available to drive evolution. Thus, they have a major influence on the dynamics of the world as we know it. Many microbial activities are of great benefit to man (e.g. for yoghurt, cheese, bread, alcohol, antibiotics, nutrient cycling, detoxification of pollutants), but others are harmful or even fatal (e.g. infectious diseases of plants, animals and humans, such as potato blight, avian \u00c2\u00bfflu\u00c2\u00bf, and tuberculosis).This course explores the basic mechanisms of some of the most important microbial processes at a cellular and sub-cellular level. Some of the key questions we will address are: how do bacteria reproduce? How do they communicate with each other, and build multicellular structures? How do they move? How do they produce toxins and other substances to affect their environment? What constitutes a bacterial genome, and how is it affected by plasmids and bacteriophages? Another section of the course relates to fungi, a large, important and under-studied group of organisms which play major roles in the environment. We will look at how fungi grow, interact with each other (even waging fungal 'warfare'), and cause human diseases. Finally, we will consider viruses, the most abundant and diverse 'organisms'. We will consider the key groups of viruses, their properties, and their significance as agents of infectious diseases and cancer, as well as their varied uses in genetic engineering and therapy.The course also includes a number of key \u00c2\u00bftransferable skills\u00c2\u00bf elements, including a substantial practical component which is designed to complement the lecture course, and to introduce and reinforce the key techniques required for working with microorganisms.

This University considers itself to be a research-led Institution and you will be exposed to cutting edge information and ideas as you progress through your degree course. In this course you will develop a comprehensive knowledge of key features and functions of major groups of microorganisms and of how their processes operate at a molecular level.Research and Enquiry: These skills are enhanced by encouraging further reading of books, research papers and electronic materials, to embellish your lecture and practical material. They underpin your ICA material (essay and summary). Understanding how to use Web of Knowledge, in part, prepares you for these aspects. It provides a route to surveying current and past scientific arguments, in an appropriate context, and provides the foundation for hypothesis driven analysis.Personal and Intellectual Autonomy: By reading and preparation of materials for tutorial sessions, you will learn to synthesise your own views, develop reasoned arguments and further refine your scientific judgement. In addition, in this course we encourage self-development through use of past papers and the online assessment system, Question Mark Perception. Such skills will enhance your capacity for life-long and independent learning.Communication: This is a key attribute of all scientists and it is therefore important that you develop skills to interact constructively with others and convey knowledgeable and balanced scientific views. Our Presentation and discussion tutorials provide a forum for this but we also encourage these skills in the Course Debate and the Learn Discussion Forum.Personal Effectiveness: The ability to organise and summarise your thoughts and material in a flexible and accessible way are core features that are required for personal effectiveness.  Planning, time management and reflection are central to this. Of course these features also interlink with your personal and intellectual autonomy. By providing you with a timetable where key submission dates are highlighted, we are encouraging you to develop your effectiveness throughout this course. These same skills extend to other courses and also to your overall ability to maximise your achievement whilst studying at this University. However they also apply to every other aspect of your current and future life. Many aspects of what you achieve in your life can be significantly influenced by you!Technical and Practical Skills: In order to continue in a scientific career it is important that you not only understand the conceptual basis of how experiments are designed and carried out but also that you have the underpinning practical skills required for employability. Our course has a particularly heavy laboratory component which is designed to prepare your for this, as well as to assist you in your future Honours course projects. As part of this, your laboratory training provides skills in basic microbiological techniques, and in safe handling of pathogenic microorganisms. The laboratory skills you develop from your practical sessions, in critical observation, investigation and interpretation, careful recording, quantification and analysis, should serve you well in any future employment.",

This University considers itself to be a research-led Institution and you will be exposed to cutting edge information and ideas as you progress through your degree course.  In this course you will develop a comprehensive knowledge of the basic functions of plants, including; how plants take up minerals and translocate solutes, how plants respond to light, the complex interplay between plants and pathogens, and the molecular basis of signalling in plants. By the end of the course, you should have an in-depth understanding of how plants 'work', backed up by numerous examples from the current literature.Research and Enquiry:  These skills are enhanced by encouraging further reading of books, research papers and electronic materials.  Practical related reports will allow you to develop your enquiry skills and develop your own views of the subject. This will allow you to search the literature and condense your views.  Understanding how to use Pubmed(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) will, in part, prepare you for these aspects. It provides a route to surveying current and past scientific arguments, in an appropriate context, and provides the foundation for hypothesis-driven analysis.Personal and Intellectual Autonomy: By reading and preparation of materials for tutorial sessions, you will learn to synthesise your own views, develop reasoned arguments and further refine your scientific judgement. A number of feedback sessions are offered, allowing students to voice their opinions and views on the subjects discussed. Such skills will enhance your capacity for life-long and independent learning.Communication: It is important that you develop skills to interact constructively with others and convey knowledgeable and balanced scientific views. During the course, you will gain experience in oral presentation skills by both presenting and listening to short talks. Constructive feedback is supplied during these sessions by both staff and fellow students.Personal Effectiveness: The ability to organise and summarise your thoughts and material in a flexible and accessible way are core features that are required for personal effectiveness.  Planning, time management and reflection are central to this. By providing you with a timetable where key submission dates are highlighted, we encourage you to develop your effectiveness throughout this course. These same skills extend to other courses and also to your overall ability to maximise your achievement whilst studying at this University.Technical and Practical Skills: In order to continue in a scientific career, it is important that you not only understand the conceptual basis of how experiments are designed and carried out but also that you have the underpinning practical skills required for employability. Our course has a lab component which is designed to prepare you for this. Your laboratory training provides skills in plant transformation techniques, numerical handling of data and basic molecular techniques including PCR. The lab skills you develop from your practical sessions, in critical observation, investigation and interpretation, careful recording, quantification and analysis, should serve you well in any future employment.",

The course has a particular focus on how modern research is increasing our understanding of pathogen biology to better address current challenges in pathogen management. Bioinformatic analysis, hypothesis generation and experimental design are also core components of the course.",
    "course_description": "The study of pathogens is extremely relevant in biology research, as infectious diseases continue to pose a challenge to both human and animal health, with devastating consequences. Increasing our understanding of pathogen biology is necessary to respond to emerging problems like resistance to currently used drugs, expansion of distribution area of certain pathogens due to climate change and increase in zoonotic diseases. At the same time, the study of infectious organisms has uncovered fundamentally important biological concepts.This course will provide an overview of the biology of different pathogens, with a particular focus on how modern research is increasing our understanding of pathogen biology to better address current challenges in pathogen management. The lectures will build on the core knowledge acquired in Microorganisms, Infection & Immunity 2 (BIME08012) to further delve into the strategies used by a range of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasitic protozoans and parasitic helminths, to infect their hosts, to survive and multiply inside them, and to ensure transmission to new hosts. Lectures will include a recap of required background knowledge, which will allow students who have not taken BIME08012 to fully integrate in the course. More lectures will be dedicated to the study of parasitic protozoans and helminths than to the rest of groups, given that parasites are less extensively covered in Year 2 than the other organisms. Evolutionary aspects of pathogen biology and current research in the field will be discussed. Lectures will be delivered by principal investigators that lead successful research groups in each topic.A series of bioinformatic workshops will help develop Python data analysis skills while working on real datasets relevant to pathogen biology research. All workshops should be attended by all students. The results of the bioinformatic analysis will then be used as a starting point for a short grant proposal, where students will suggest a follow-up question and design an experimental approach to answer it. This will develop hypothesis generation and research skills.Three practical laboratory sessions will focus on parasites, complementing the material taught in the lectures.",

The students will interrogate a dataset and then formulate further questions that follow up on the analysis results, providing real experience in hypothesis-driven analysis.Personal and Intellectual Autonomy: The students will autonomously formulate a research question that follows up on the bioinformatic analysis and that they believe would address an important question in pathogen biology. Writing of a grant proposal about it will require students to use their scientific judgement, synthesise their own views and develop reasoned arguments related to wider context. The practical sessions also provide an opportunity to apply the knowledge acquired in the laboratory to independently answer questions that are often faced by health workers and researchers.Communication: A peer-feedback session at the end of the bioinformatic workshops will help students develop communication skills to interact constructively with others, providing feedback respectfully and being able to consider and act upon feedback received. The grant proposal tutorial and assessment will help students develop written communication skills. Interactions with lecturers and tutors throughout the course will provide further opportunities to develop communication and interpersonal skills.Personal Effectiveness: Students will work on their personal effectiveness skills when organising their time to meet the deadlines of the course and when deciding how to communicate their results and ideas in the peer feedback session and the grant proposal.Technical and Practical Skills: Students will develop bioinformatic and numeracy skills in the data analysis workshops, contributing to graduate employability.

    "summary": "This course explores the interactions between organisms, the dynamics of populations and the environment.  It deals with animal, plant and pathogenic organisms, and the structuring and function of communities and aims to develop both a quantitative and qualitative understanding of interactions between organisms and their consequences.  The course consists of about 20 lectures and several extended practicals lasting two weeks.",
    "course_description": "Population ecology is the study of how populations of plants, animals, and other organisms change over time and space and interact with their environment.The course is broken down into three parts:Population BiologySpecies InteractionsCommunity EcologyWe start at the simplest level: how environmental factors influence the growth of a single species population. We then add further complexity by examining how interactions between species affect their growth. Finally, we study the interactions of whole groups of species that make up communities.Populations are groups of organisms of the same species living in the same area at the same time. They are described by characteristics that include:- population size: the number of individuals in the population- population density: how many individuals are in a particular area- population growth: how the size of the population is changing over time.If population growth is just one of many population characteristics, what makes studying it so important?First, studying how and why populations grow (or shrink) helps scientists make better predictions about future changes in population sizes and growth rates. This is essential for answering questions in areas such as biodiversity conservation (e.g., the polar bear population is declining, but how quickly, and when will it be so small that the population is at risk for extinction?) and human population growth (e.g., how fast will the human population grow, and what does that mean for climate change, resource use, and biodiversity?).Studying population growth also helps scientists understand what causes changes in population sizes and growth rates. For example, fisheries scientists know that some salmon populations are declining, but do not necessarily know why. Are salmon populations declining because they have been overfished by humans? Has salmon habitat disappeared? Have ocean temperatures changed causing fewer salmon to survive to maturity? Or, maybe even more likely, is it a combination of these things? If scientists do not understand what is causing the declines, it is much more difficult for them to do anything about it. Learning what is probably not affecting a population can be as informative as learning what is.Finally, studying population growth gives scientists insight into how organisms interact with each other and with their environments. This is especially meaningful when considering the potential impacts of climate change and other changes in environmental factors (how will populations respond to changing temperatures? To drought? Will one population prosper after another declines?).A community is a group of interacting species that inhabit a particular location at a particular time. Community ecologists study the number of species in a particular location and ask why the number of species changes over time. They also study communities in different locations, and ask why the number of species differs with location.How does the depth of a lake influence the complexity of the community living within it? Why do some places contain more species than others?Community ecology seeks to answer these and other questions about communities. An ecological community is a group of actually or potentially interacting species living in the same location. Communities are bound together by a shared environment and a network of influence each species has on the other.Community ecology is an expanding and rich subfield of ecology. Ecologists investigate the factors that influence biodiversity, community structure, and the distribution and abundance of species. These factors include interactions with the abiotic world and the diverse array of interactions that occur between species. Species interactions, including competition, predation, herbivory, parasitism and mutualisms, are the basis for most of the research in community ecology. Questions of interest include: What are the feeding relationships among species? Who competes with whom and for what resources? Does the presence of some species benefit others?Food webs are a graphical depiction of the interconnections among species based on feeding relationships, and are a core concept of the field. The role of keystone species in communities is another important tenet, and one of the best-known ideas in community ecology. Keystone species are those whose presence or absence profoundly affects other species in the community, disproportionately to its abundance.A central feature of Population and Community Ecology is the use of mathematical models for describing and understanding how populations and communities change. The course therefore introduces some simple models, derived from first principles. We then demonstrate how they help us in our understanding, particularly when they break down thereby forcing us to consider possible alternative explanations.Computer modelling is also an important tool for population biologists in forecasting population numbers (for example fish stocks, or species re-introductions). The first practical introduces simple computer models of populations facing extinction and examines what conservation efforts might alleviate the risk of extinction. A report will be written about this practical and assessed.Communities are strongly influenced by their physical environment. Before attempting to unravel the mechanisms that might underlie differences among communities, we must first find ways to describe and compare communities, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The fantastic communities of micro-organisms that live on bog mosses of the genus Sphagnum are a good model system in which to learn about these techniques. The second practical introduces measures of species diversity, and how to collect data to calculate them. A report will be written about this practical and assessed.",

    "course_description": "How does protein structure and their dynamic properties work to produce the great range of physiological responses that we observe in cells? The course provides the basic groundwork necessary to equip a future Honours student in Biochemistry or Molecular Biology to answer this question. However, because of the rapid development of molecular studies and their growing importance in many areas of modern laboratory-based biology, the course is also designed to provide a strong background for students heading eventually for Biotechnology, Genetics, Immunology, or Pharmacology. The information in this course provides the basis for modern drug development strategies and an underpinning for the pharmaceutical industry.The emphasis is oriented towards development as a scientist and to making the transitions to Junior Honours. Experimental techniques and lectures are supplemented with workshops that reinforce this approach. An important feature of the in-course assessment is to introduce students to the scientific literature, both in terms of how to read and how to appraise critically original papers.Practicals provide hands-on experience of currently used laboratory techniques such as electrophoretic mobility shift assay, spectroscopy, electrophoresis, and protein chromatography; development of skills in experimental design and in handling quantitative data are particularly important. Molecular graphics and modelling software is introduced to allow easy manipulation and examination of complex molecules, in order to supplement practical, lecture and workshop material.There are four main themes in the lecture course:(i) Students are introduced to the types of quaternary structure, and their symmetries, that are found in biological complexes.(ii) Then there is an emphasis on how we find out about proteins: about how mass spectroscopy can be used to identity proteins, and to establish stoichiometry of complexes; about how X-ray crystallography, NMR, and cryo e-m are used to determine protein structures; and about how optical methods are used to follow dynamic properties, particularly those related to fluorescence, a major technique.(iii) The third theme is on quantitative analysis of the kinetics of protein:protein interactions and of reactions catalysed by proteins.(iv) The principles established in the first three themes are explored by looking at molecular machines, particularly those that are drug targets: G-coupled Protein Receptors and ion channels, with an introduction to membrane structure.",

    "summary": "The aim of these lectures is to familiarise students with the variety of mechanisms responsible for regulating the expression of genetic information at the level of transcription and post-transcription mechanisms. This will cover both prokaryotes and eukaryotes with an introduction to RNA splicing. Genetic regulation in prokaryotes is discussed with respect to sigma factors, two component protein regulators and how this relates to microbial physiology. The second half of the course deals with the principles and applications of microbial regulation in biotechnology. Topics include protein secretion in pathogenesis, protein expression systems in biotechnology and the problems of antimicrobial resistance.",

When does regeneration rely on specialised stem cells, and when is it achieved through 'reprogramming\" of differentiated functional cells?  What do these mechanisms of reprogramming tell us about how the differentiated state is normally stabilised? Is there a trade-off between the stability of organ structure that is required for complex functions and the flexibility that allows for regeneration?Are there common strategies for regeneration used by both plants and animals, having been discovered independently during the evolution of multicellular organisms? Why is it that mammals can regenerate some organs, for example the liver, very effectively whilst others, such as the spinal cord, do not regenerate at all?  And why is it that other animals, such as fish or newts, can regenerate their spinal cord while we cannot?",

It affects every aspect of our lives, from food security (pollinators, fisheries, crop genetic diversity) and health (pathogen evolution, emergence of zoonotic diseases), to rural economics, sports and leisure (hunting, bird watching, re-wilding) and building materials (forestry). Effectively managing wild populations requires a thorough understanding of the fundamental biology and ecology of populations and communities.The course will build upon basic population and community ecology to provide students with a conceptual toolkit for thinking about managing wild populations. We will start by revising core concepts and exploring how to use them to identify anthropogenic changes and determine their causes. We will then examine the major threats to biodiversity and intervention strategies in response, exploring the different aims, requirements and outcomes of the more commonly used approaches.",
    "course_description": "The course is based around around 11 lectures and will also involve group discussion sessions centred on salient topics covered in these lectures. We will also conduct a key question scan to identify the outstanding questions in the field. The first half of the course focuses on the conceptual underpinnings of the field and the second half on major threats to biodiversity.The lectures will coverAn introduction to conservation biology and biodiversityDemography and conservationCommunity ecology and conservationEvidence based conservationConservation geneticsIdentifying when diversity is under pressureThe impacts of land-use changeOverexploitationBiological invasionsConservation in the face of climate changeConservation and people",

    "summary": "Marine (coastal and ocean) environments are fundamental features of the Earth system that are profoundly influenced by human interactions. As these ecosystems are trans-boundary and multi-dimensional, the policy instruments governing the utilization of coastal ocean systems are complex. However, policies, laws and regulations are often disconnected to the scale and dynamics of targeted ecosystems and species in both time and space (e.g. oceanographic processes, migratory species, multi-site life stages). Many global to local scale policies could be more effective, support deeper understanding of ecosystem processes, and take into account cumulative impacts of social pressures and environmental change. Additionally, as technology advances, human population increases, and energy demands extend the horizons of marine exploration and exploitation further offshore, understanding the impacts of policies in coastal-ocean realms is increasingly vital.This course uses case studies to gain an understanding of marine conservation measures and spatial planning, to explore linkages between different scales of coastal-ocean ecosystem processes and ecological dynamics in connection with applicable scales of policy instruments (e.g. Law of the Sea, Convention of Biodiversity, UNESCO World Heritage; regional conventions; local codes and policies framed around fishing regulations, coastal zoning, and traditional knowlege). Diverse case studies across a range of biomes, scales, and issues are considered to examine and test the suitability of different policies for different ecosystem scales, environmental issues and socio-cultural contexts. Examples of case study scales include: Archipelagos and Islands, Estuaries, Semi-enclosed Seas, Continental Margins, Polar Seas, and Global Oceans.This course is focused on marine ecosystems, issues and policies in an integrated way that provides foundational learning for critical analysis of marine environments and human impacts. This course will help prepare students for positions in governments, NGOs, environmental consultancies and private enterprises requiring competency at the science-policy interface. (Note: This course is co-taught as a 20c course for PGT students and for a small number of fourth year UG Env. GeoScience and Ecology students, with joint lecture sessions)",
    "course_description": "This course has 3 components:i. Lectures on marine planning: in-class lectures to introduce concepts of maritime security, conflicts and ocean-grabbing, and three key planning processes and case studies worldwide (Marine Spatial Planning, Strategic Environmental Assessment, Environmental Impact Assessment). Lectures also include principles of sustainable development in small-scale fisheries, marine tourism, aquaculture and sustainability issues around deep seabed mining, sometimes with guest experts;ii. Group project: working in groups of 4-6 students, each group will report on outcomes of a mock strategic environmental assessment of a marine tourism strategy;iii. Blue papers: students will write a paper that explores and critiques a real-world case study of one of the marine planning process learned about in class.",

This course will explore the application of ecological and evolutionary concepts and methods to applied, real-world problems. Through examination of case studies of applications of ecological and evolutionary ideas and methods, students will explore the breadth of problems their skills in these areas can be applied to, and what makes for a good ecological or evolutionary approach to these problems.Topics covered in the course will include how ecological and evolutionary approaches are influencing economics and financial regulation, the treatment of disease, manipulation of human behaviour, sustainable development, biotechnology and computing. These areas will be explored via lectures on specific case studies, discussion sessions, reflection by students on how their skills could help them contribute to solutions to these problems, and student presentations.",

    "course_description": "The extension of next-generation DNA sequencing to geologically fossils has been spearheaded by the desire to understand human origins. This course covers the methods by which this knowledge is gained, what has been learnt with respect to the last 100,000 years of human history and the population genetics that is critical to our understanding of the underlying processes.The course will focus on modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans, the exit from Africa and its evolutionary consequences. Introgression among these will be considered in detail, its present-day outcome and the role both positive and negative selection has played in determining that. The course will also consider more recent events, including the major population movements that have been revealed by palaeogenomics to have been associated with the Neolithic revolution and the spread of the Indo-European languages, and evidence for parallel events within Africa.Students will be aware at the conclusion of this course that Africa is the origin of modern humans and the African human population shows far more genetic diversity than that found among non-African populations. They will understand the nature of species mixing that affects all non-African populations as they show introgression of Neanderthal DNA, and for Melanesian populations of Denisovan DNA as well. The students will acquire understanding of population genetics, particularly of human mutation rates, linkage disequilibrium and selection which will allow them to evaluate the evidence for these events. They will acquire skills in analysis of data from such settings from practicals using real data and in critical evaluation of the literature in assessed coursework.Topics to be covered:The palaeontological background of hominin evolution over the last 2 million yearsMolecular population genetics revision - reviewing fundamental concepts in population genetics of particular relevance to human molecular evolution and variationMutation rate in humans - contrasting estimates of the mutation rate in humans, based on between-species molecular divergence and genome sequencing of relatives. The human deleterious mutation rate and the mutation load paradox.Problems and technical solutions in palaeogenomics: DNA degradation & contamination; ultra-short reads & CT modificationVariation in nucleotide diversity across the human genome - why genetic linkage reduces the efficiency of natural selection and how linkage to sites under selection reduces diversity.Palaeogenomics - Neanderthals, Denisovans and modern humans up to 20kyrBP: divergence and diversity in recent homininsArchaic introgression from Neandertals and Denisovans into Eurasians; lack of evidence for introgression from mt trees; ABBA/BABA test and admixture graphs; archaic introgression in AfricaThe mechanistics of recombination in humans; hotspots and coldspots and their evolution (comparing Great Apes); sex bias in recombination.Recombination as a clock: Modelling  recombination along the genome; inferring the out of Africa bottleneck from single diploid genomes. Homozygosity tracts and inbreeding in Altai Neandertals and Denisova. Introduction to chromosome painting. The fate of introgressed tracts under neutrality; comparison of Neanderthal tracts in modern and ancient H.sapiens genomes.Introgression and its legacy: Adaptive archaic  introgression in Humans (e.g. Denisova high altitude haplotype, MC1R, Toll-like receptors). Maladaptive archaic  introgression: autoimmune disorders; perhaps a little bit on complex traits linked to archaic introgressionWhat made modern humans - long-term selection acting on the lineage leading to modern humans - MK-like analysis of selection on the hominin lineage, and historic sweep analyses of the AMH lineagePost-glacial palaeogenomics: The hunter-gatherers and the Neolithic revolution. Population diversity in the Bronze age.Global mass migration - its long history revealed in 5 continentsRecent positive selection - recent selection on the human genome, including soft, recent, and local sweeps at loci involved in appearance, immunity, and the (sometimes self-imposed) environmentBasis of genetic disease - potential epistatic costs of past positive or balancing selection ('mismatches with modernity') and the potential to identify loci through GWAS given the DFEThe course will be delivered through lectures, with a small number of tutorials on specialist topics.",

The module is organised in sessions of either lectures by academic staff, or presentations and discussion by the students of research literature on topics related to the lectures.  The sessions on trypanosomes will focus upon two unique and characteristic aspects of the molecular cellular biology of these eukaryotic parasites, namely the phenomenon of antigenic variation and their mitochondrial biology.  The session on Listeria will look at the survival strategies of a cytosolically replicating bacterial pathogen.  The session on malaria will cover parasite virulence genes and discuss the cellular and molecular basis of the pathogenesis of malaria.  The session on Toxoplasma will cover host and parasite factors impacting infection outcomes, and the genetic approaches used to identify them.  The session on nematodes and viruses will focus on how these pathogens can use micro RNAs to regulate host gene expression.",

These lectures deal with the molecular mechanisms involved in the fundamental process of DNA replication and the controls regulating its occurrence during the cell cycles of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In bacteria, cell growth and cell wall assembly are coordinated with cell cycle progress, and the assembly of a septum cross-wall is essential for cell division. Duplication of the genetic material becomes more complex in eukaryotic cells, as chromosomes are larger and DNA is tightly packed into chromatin. Controls called checkpoints prevent the cell from initiating late cell cycle events until earlier processes have been correctly completed. Failure of these checkpoints in vertebrate cells is implicated in some forms of cancer.",

    "course_description": "Immunology is a rapidly evolving subject that is at the forefront of many current advances in science and medicine. Immunology is fundamental to the diagnosis and treatment of important disorders including autoimmunity and allergic diseases and immune deficiencies. It is also central to transplantation science, tumour biology and to vaccine development. This integrated programme aims to provide students with an advanced knowledge and understanding of the immune system, the ability to apply that knowledge to medical, veterinary, biological and biotechnological problems, and hands-on research experience.Immunology Honours is an inter-college programme for students of biological sciences and for medical students taking an intercalated Honours year, leading to B.Sc. Hons in either Biological Sciences (Immunology) or Medical Sciences (Immunology). Staff from both the College of Science and Engineering and from the College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine teach on this programme, as well as lecturers from research institutes in and outside Edinburgh. The teaching programme is run at the Institute of Immunology and Infection Research, Ashworth Laboratories, King\u00c2\u00bfs Buildings. Practical research projects are carried out in participating biomedical and clinical research laboratories in Edinburgh.In the first week of the course we take all the Immunology students for a reading party to Firbush, the University Centre for Sport and Exercise Field Centre on Loch Tay. This provides an early opportunity for students and staff to get to know one another. In between the outdoor leisure activities at Firbush there are some academic sessions: for instance a talk given by a leading UK research immunologist and an introductory tutorial.Immunology Honours is a modular Programme of Courses. Of the 120 credits required for an honours degree, 90 are compulsory; other courses (electives) are optional. Two of these electives must be from the Immunology list, while the other one can be taken from other programmes (e.g. Genetics, Zoology, Molecular Biology). Semester 1 teaching consists of two core (compulsory) courses, Molecular and Cellular Immunology and Experimental Immunology, as well as two electives (home electives are: Immunobiology of Malaria; Stem Cells, Haematopoiesis and Immune Therapy; Th2 in Immunity, Allergy and Health). These titles only indicate the general areas of study; more specialised topics are selected for deeper study. Each Semester 1 course is taught on one day per week, except for the 20-credit 'Molecular and Cellular Immunology\u00c2\u00bf that is taught on two days per week. Contact hours include lectures, tutorials, workshops, student presentations, and discussions, with about 2-3 hours/week contact time per session (running over 10 weeks). Reading of original scientific papers, preparation of oral and written presentations, and teamwork are essential components of these modules. Semester 1 modules will be assessed by a mixture of in course assessments, and exams in weeks 12-13 (December).There are two compulsory full-year courses, the 10-credit course Experimental Immunology and the 60-credit Research Project. Experimental Immunology uses a mixture of workshops and online content to cover central aspects of experimental design, analysis, and interpretation of results, as well as important immunological experimental techniques. Laboratory research projects will be allocated by week 4 of Semester 1, once all students have made their project choices. Once projects have been allocated, supervisors meet with students to discuss the project, providing starter references and background reading material for the project. Students produce a 2,000-word project literature review for hand-in and assessment (10-credits) at the beginning of Semester 2.In Semester 2 only one Immunology elective course is offered (Therapeutic Immunology), running two mornings per week in the first half of Semester 2. The majority of time during Semester 2 will be occupied by a compulsory individual lab-based research project (a wide variety of topics are on offer). The project provides a real flavour of how research is carried out, as the projects are all embedded in active research labs, contributing to the lab\u00c2\u00bfs research programme.Throughout the year, there are many relevant Immunology seminars, either as part of the Edinburgh Immunology Group or the IIIR Seminar series. These seminars are regarded as an important extension of the teaching and student attendance is strongly advised.",

    "summary": "This course will provide a general introduction to stem cell biology, and will then cover in detail the biology of haematopoietic stem cells and their use in transplantation, with emphasis on the requirements for reconstitution of the immune system.  We will start by considering the definition of a stem cell and discussing the different classes of stem cell  (eg. pluripotent or adult). We will continue with discussion of how differentiation of stem cells is initiated, including the mechanisms such as short and long-term DNA modifications and re-programming of transcriptional machinery. Following on we will focus on the generation of leukocytes from stem cells:Haematopoiesis: what are the steps, in the bone marrow, that lead from the haematopoietic stem cell to the different cell lineages found in blood and lymphoid tissues, what are their functions and what are the relationships between these lineages?B cell differentiation: how is the antibody repertoire generated?T cell differentiation: what are the molecular events in the thymus that direct differentiation of a lymphocyte-committed progenitor to a naive T cells with a defined functional potential that is nevertheless tolerant of self.Therapeutic potential of immune reconstitution in the adult: what are the issues involved in reconstitution of the haematopoeitic system of adults after bone marrow or stem cell transplantation as therapy for diseases such as leukaemia or autoimmunity.It is intended that by the end of the course the students will be familiar with key concepts in stem cell biology, and will have gained a good understanding of extrinsic and intrinsic regulation of the differentiation of specific haematopoietic lineages. The immune system serves as a useful paradigm to appreciate the complexities and pitfalls of cellular differentiation, and the course will act as a valuable introduction for students interested in the biology and therapeutic potential of stem cells",

    "summary": "The dichotomy of T cell responses into Th1 and Th2 remains a major paradigm in immunology, despite the appearance of multiple other T cell subsets. This unit will focus on the development and functions of the Th2 arm, which is uniquely responsible for a suite of essential immune defences (eg against helminth parasites), but also associated with specific pathologies (eg allergy) as well as body maintenance functions (wound healing and metabolism).  By studying Th2, we can readily illustrate and understand the regulation and balance within the immune system that dictates when different modes of immunity are selected or repressed, thereby leading to better therapies for infection or immune dysfunction.A further fascinating aspect of this topic is the complementarity between the innate and adaptive immune systems, particularly with the recent definition of innate lymphoid cells which mirror the functions of Th2 cells. Moreover, there is a important set of \"Type 2\" innate effector cells, including eosinophils, basophils and alternatively activated macrophages, which are involved in both the induction of Th2 response but also in executing effector functions downstream of Th2 signals. These cells are also intimately linked with wound healing and the response to injury, as well as maintaining optimal metabolic status, because Th1/Th2 imbalance is associated with various forms of physiological malfunctions such as type II diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.The module will include both lectures and analysis of the primary literature. The course will start with lectures on the basic differentiaton and function of Th2 cells, as well as an overview of the innate Type 2 populations, together with an evolutionary perspective of the Th2 arm of immunity.  Following sessions will be a combination of lectures focussing on specific themes and discussion of the primary literature. Topics covered will include immunity to helminths, the development of allergy, modes of regulation of the Th2 response, and the role of the Type 2 response in wound healing and metabolism. Review of the primary literature will be in the form of presentations and question-and-answer sessions.  Students will be expected to read the papers in advance and actively engage in an analysis of the papers\u00c2\u00bf findings.",

    "summary": "Immunopathology caused by autoimmune and allergic diseases is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in western populations. They result from failures in immune tolerance mechanisms, thereby allowing unwanted immunity to self (autoimmunity) or to innocuous non-self antigens such as food (allergy). Transplant rejection is a related problem, in that there is a lack of established tolerance to allogeneic antigens expressed by the transplanted organ. In each of these pathologic scenarios there is a need for improved immunotherapy, because currently there are no cures and life-long immunosuppression, or the use of very potent immunomodulatory biologics, have significant adverse effects.In this course we shall develop an understanding of the pathways leading to these diseases, with particular emphasis on how we can treat these currently, and how we might better treat them with more effective, directed therapies in the future.We shall draw on various fundamental aspects of immunology the role of MHC, antigen processing and presentation, the role of co-stimulation in the immune response, cytokines, etc. Therefore the core immunology course will be required for this course. The course will involve a mixture of lectures and problem-based learning with an emphasis on discussion of the controversial aspects of the subject. By the end of the course the student will be expected to have an understanding of the topic within the context of general immune mechanisms.",

In addition, we will discuss the relevance of genomic instability for human disease.  The DNA in all organisms is constantly damaged by exogenous and endogenous sources such as chemicals, radiation, and natural cell metabolic processes.  Cells have evolved a multitude of mechanisms to recognise and repair different kinds of DNA damage (stalled replication forks, DNA double-strand breaks, DNA mismatches, abasic sites, damaged nucleotides, etc) to preserve genome stability.  These mechanisms are co-ordinated and are an integral part of the global cellular network ensuring cell fitness and survival.  In higher eukaryotes, such as humans, defective biological responses to DNA damage such as an inability to repair DNA damage or to co-ordinate repair with cell cycle progression can result in a number of diseases.  These include cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, developmental syndromes, and many more.",

    "course_description": "For almost all of human history, natural biological systems have provided all of the resources required by humans to survive and thrive. The discovery of fossil fuels and chemical processes rapidly replaced natural systems and traditional methods in agriculture, medicine and industry. While these developments have led to an astonishing improvement in quality of life of the average person, since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the continued use of fossil fuels is unsustainable and is altering the climate of the planet with potentially catastrophic consequences, so we must develop alternative solutions. Modern understanding of biology has led to the development of techniques to directly modify biological molecules and systems, so rather than relying on natural diversity, we can design new biology to replace these processes and tackle the challenges that society is currently facing.This course aims to provide an overview of the rapidly emerging field of biodesign, where biological molecules and systems are repurposed, modified or designed from scratch. We will specifically focus on applications of biodesign for sustainability, and demonstrate how novel biological systems can, and have, replaced environmentally damaging processes. Lecturers with active research labs in this field will cover 5 key areas where biodesign is being applied: agritech, biomaterials, biocatalysis, biologics and sensing. Students will work in small groups to tackle \"biodesign challenges\" set by each lecturer, where they will be supported to develop creative solutions to these challenges, applying the biodesign techniques that they are learning to develop feasible research plans.",

We will also have practicals each week where the students will explore how to apply these methods to concrete, resource management, conservation and environmental change examples.",
    "course_description": "Anthropogenic pressure on ecosystems and biodiversity has greatly accelerated over the past 50 years, with climate change, land use change, overexploitation, biological invasions and pollution being the main threats to biodiversity. Current trajectories and conservation goals are insufficient to achieve a sustainable use of nature, highlighting the need for transformative changes. Designing transformative changes requires a sound understanding of the mechanisms underlying population, community and ecosystem dynamics, and their response to these five main anthropogenic pressures. This course will provide students with the required theoretical and conceptual background in population and community ecology, to explore future global environmental responses to anthropogenic pressures and use models to test alternative management options to mitigate their consequences. Through modelling practicals and paper discussions, students will learn how to apply this knowledge acquired during the lectures to investigate population and community dynamics, and to research questions in the context of global change.Topics covered in the course will include population demography, species distribution models, multi-species dynamics and interactions, community ecology (including community assembly models, network analyses and the quantification of community patterns), and ecosystem functioning. Practicals will be used to apply these concepts to understand the impacts of major anthropogenic changes on biodiversity at the population, species and community level. The capacity of students to synthesise this knowledge and apply the skills acquired through practicals will be assessed through a research grant proposal.",

Environmental change is one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. This course will therefore provide the students the skills needed to conserve and restore nature, and move towards more sustainable use.2) Aspiration and personal development: The combination of theoretical and conceptual lectures with practicals based on real-life examples will enable the students to develop their potential for applying quantitative approaches to evidence-based conservation. By writing, presenting and peer-reviewing grant proposals, this assessment will encourage the students to develop critical thinking while offering them the freedom to pursue their goals and opportunities to grow.3) Outlook and engagement: The skills acquired during this course, including  paper discussions and constructive criticisms on research grant pitches, will give the student the scientific foundation to engage with other scientists, communities and the world around them. These engagement skills will be further complemented by another course from the MSc programme, Professional Skills for Ecology and Evolution.4) Research and enquiry: This course will combine theoretical lectures with practicals enabling the students to apply the learned theory and concepts, based on real data and published approaches, to apply state-of-the-art scientific methods to tackle concrete ecological issues resulting from environmental change. Their research and enquiry skills will be showcased through the mock research grant proposal.5) Personal and intellectual autonomy: The formal course assessment will be a grant proposal, providing opportunity to both foster and assess the personal and intellectual autonomy to critically evaluate ideas, evidence and experiences from an open-minded and reasoned perspective. This will be reinforced through the pitching session, during which students will provide constructive criticisms to each other.6) Personal effectiveness: Each week a new topic will be introduced, through both lectures and complementary practicals that provide opportunities for training in a diversity of skills, therefore enabling the students to develop their adaptive skill to new topics.7) Communication: The course will include a formative assessment in the form of a grant pitch presentation to the class, to improve their communication skills while giving them the opportunity to interact in a productive fashion with each other by critically discussing their projects.",

The course relies heavily on the understanding of floral structures (through floral diagrams and floral formulae) and the identification of plants to family level using key characters. The evolution of angiosperms is reflected in the study of their floral diversity. The study of angiosperm diversity involves the sampling and observation of diverse living floral material grown at RBGE.",
    "course_description": "The purpose of the course is to explain the origin, evolution and special features of the angiosperms to enable the understanding of the relationships of major groups of plants. The lectures are provided in the context of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG IV, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society 181: 1-20, 2016) and give a broad outline of the major clades and the evolution of key characters. The major lineages of Angiosperms are presented with emphasis on major events of evolution and diversification. Further to this, the evolution of the angiosperms is approached from a floral structural perspective. Morphological characters linked to the flower are analysed and linked with the evolutionary developmental genetics underlying floral development. Other elements affecting floral evolution, such as pollination ecology, are presented. Throughout, full use is made of the excellent collections of living plants at RBGE. Teaching is lecture based, with emphasis on floral morphology and a general discussion of the angiosperm phylogeny in the first term, while the second term is devoted to the observation and analysis of flowers and their characters during weekly practical sessions including guided walks among the RBGE collections. The practicals give the opportunity to extend on key characters based on further sampling and observation of living floral material grown at RBGE. The availability of living study material involves the study of plants as an entity and students are encouraged to explore these living resource, and record their observations by drawing half-flowers including floral diagrams and floral formulae, as an effective way to become acquainted with the diversity of angiosperm families. After completing this course in combination with the fieldtrip, you should be able to identify major plant groups by sight, mostly to family level.",

Each of you is coming from a different viewpoint/background, and with the Bioinformatics degree, we try to maximise the opportunities for you, whatever it is you have chosen.",
    "course_description": "The BPSM course comprises examples of the different ways we could use bioinformatics software in the Linux environment, as well as introducing the Python programming language.  It is important to note that we start everyone off at level zero: we assume that you have no experience of using computers to answer biological questions!  Remember, this is BIO-informatics, so the emphasis is very much on using the tools and procedures we learn to help you analyse, and more importantly, interpret, biological data.  We do not attempt to make you into IT managers that could go straight into some large accounting firm: if that is really what you want to do, this is not the course (or perhaps degree) for you!What sort of things do we do? The course is structured such that we have two three-hour lecture/workshops per week, and we do those in person.  Within each of these, a topic is covered, you do some exercises on that topic, and then at the end of each session, we go through possible answers to the exercises, answer questions, etc.We start our journey learning some of the more useful Linux commands for use on our course servers, and over subsequent lessons, the complexity increases, including SQL, BLAST, and learning how to use git and GitHub, culminating in the first assessment task, which involves writing a programme that interacts with the user.  When you get your marks back, there will be detailed feedback given.Towards the second half of the semester, we learn about Python, and how to use it.  The emphasis here is learning how to write your own Python code, not just use modules that are already out there on the shelf.  The second course assignment also involves writing a user-interactive biological programme, but this time in Python, and drawing on all that has been learnt over the course of the Semester; once again, you will get detailed feedback on what you have submitted for the assignment.  The final assessment component is the exam in December, for which more details will be made available during the course itself.The BPSM course is, as already mentioned, a compulsory component of the MSc Bioinformatics degree.  The degree has several compulsory components, but also several elective courses: the ones you get to choose.  When it comes to doing your project, you will get to actually use/integrate all the knowledge that you have gained over the course of the two semesters, so if there is ever anything you don't understand when doing a course, please just ask straight away....we are here to help you, whichever course it is!",

Students need to have an appreciation of how those known models are derived and what quality metrics are associated with them. In this course this then feeds into the use of models in drug discovery and the validity and reliability of these models.",
    "course_description": "Students will be given overviews of major proteins structure determination methods, with emphasis on the differing physical requirements from each one, the differing types of information that each technique gives and quality metrics associated with the different techniques. This is to allow the students to differentiate the different inputs to molecular models and what information they bring. This then leads into a discussion of general aspects of model based drug discovery and several examples of this will be presented. During this time they will be performing practical work developing their own report based around drug discovery of a for a pathogen protein described by sequence. They will need to decide if this sequence and its mammal analogue have suitable structures available, what sort of quality those structures are, if model structures need to be built or acquired (eg from databases of modeled structures). They will perform a simply virtual screening on these models and describe the output in terms of quality of hits and reliability given quality of inputs.",

Non-profit models for drug discovery and development through government funding agencies will also be discussed. Visits to companies and/or presentations from business managers and entrepreneurs will be used to provide an insight into what factors drive success in a wide range of science-based companies. From the presentations and visit you will write a short essay summarising the key learnings. You will also present your original idea for starting a biotech-related enterprise via a shore presentation and essay. You will use the information presented over the course to develop a business plan for your own biotech start-up company. Groups of 4 to 6 will work together to develop an original business plan that will be presented to the Course Organiser and the visiting speakers.",
    "course_description": "There will be a series of presentations from a number of SME (small-medium enterprise) biotech companies, research institutes, entrepreneurs and funders. Where possible site visits will be organised which will provide an opportunity to study the detailed workings of experimental programs in a commercial environment. Scientific techniques will include assay development, HTS (High Throughput Screening) microarray technology, and medicinal chemistry. Discussion sessions with biotech managers and scientists will provide an opportunity of analysing the key steps and bottlenecks in the translational process.

The course begins by introducing global challenges, current conservation issues, conservation policies and mechanisms. Students will learn about different types of conservation interventions and their pros and cons, drawing on examples from many parts of the world and covering both in- and ex-situ conservation. This is followed by an introduction to several state-of-the-art techniques that are used to prioritise areas and species for conservation - including GIS, Red List assessments, Species Distribution Modelling, and an introduction to (biodiversity) survey planning and data analysis. The course therewith provides students with transferable skills. It also includes a brief session on how to apply for (conservation) jobs and PhDs.",

    "summary": "In this course students will examine the breadth of anthropogenic impacts on the environment and their influence on selection and evolution. They will gain practical and critical skills in detecting and evaluating these impacts. Each week will be composed of lectures that will cover a range of case studies and highlight conceptual linkages between approaches, plus workshops/discussions/practicals that will provide students with the opportunity to critique findings, analyse data and communicate findings.",
    "course_description": "Anthropogenic changes to the environment are global and ubiquitous, from climate change and ocean acidification, through land-use change and urbanisation, to pollutants. The organisms best placed to survive and prosper in the face of this unprecedented change are likely to be those that can evolve to become better adapted to these altered environmental conditions, while others may require targeted interventions. Evolutionary biologists face the challenge of identifying the effects of anthropogenic drivers on the capacity of different organisms to adapt. This understanding is essential to our ability to predict how populations and ecosystems will respond to sustained environmental change, and our ability to mitigate.This course will provide students with a solid theoretical foundation before examining in detail case studies that span a breadth of range of anthropogenic drivers, approaches (quantitative genetics, population genetics, experiments), taxa and environments. Case studies will give students an opportunity to examine and critique all steps of the scientific process from the questions asked, to data collection, analysis and drawing conclusions. Alongside case-studies the lectures will emphasise the concepts and methods to draw attention to commonalities and transferability across different drivers and taxa. To cement the value of critically evaluating evidence the students will conduct a class meta-analysis for the duration of the course. There will also be an emphasis on presenting results to a variety of audiences, including scientists and policy-makers.Topics covered will include examination of evolutionary responses to different global drivers of environmental change, and different methodological approaches to their study, including: common garden experiments, quantitative genetic and population genetic approaches, space-for-time methods, predictive models and meta-analysis.",

The course will seek to teach students how advances in bioscience have been spun out into biotech companies and how such entrepreneurial biotechs have both succeeded and failed in becoming sustainable enterprises.It will also emphasise that biotech investors do not back individuals, they back viable teams and consequently around half of the course will involve working in small teams on group projects and proposals.The course aims to teach students how to:- Identify potentially significant scientific advances which open up valuable opportunities.- Create a team to take advantage of such an opportunity.- Obtain the resources necessary to create an entrepreneurial organisation.- Manage the entrepreneurial organisation after its launch.- Seek to grow the business into a sustainable enterprise.- Create value for the enterprise's stakeholders.",

The planet's population is predicted to peak at over 9 billion in the second half of this century. To provide food and dignified living conditions, agricultural productivity will have to increase 50% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. This task is extremely urgent and challenging, as it will have to coincide with a transition to more sustainable and less energy-intensive agricultural practices and be achieved with less agricultural land due to climate change and urbanisation.This course will focus on plants and explore the fundamental constraints and opportunities for sustainable food and bioenergy production, as well as the use of plants to supply high-value products for human welfare.Teaching objectives- In lectures, to provide a framework for understanding contemporary constraints and opportunities for modern use of plants for food and non-food products;- In paper analysis, develop skills in critical analysis and provide confidence in working with complex concepts in biology and society;- In oral presentations, promote skills in succinct oral communication of science.Course objectives- To provide a knowledge base of the fundamental biotic and abiotic factors contributing to increasing or diminishing plant productivity;- To provide a knowledge base of the fundamental societal factors that impact the development opportunities for intelligent agriculture;- To provide a knowledge base of the fundamental environmental constraints that will condition increases in plant productivity;- To provide a knowledge base for rational decisions in the relative balance of plant use for food and non-food purposes;- To provide a knowledge base for the analysis of the balance of energy and resource inputs and outputs in the use of plants for non-food purposes.",

This is followed by either an introduction to biology (including evolution and the Central Dogma) or an introduction to scientific computing (use of a Linux server). Students choose which to take on the basis of their own background, and online materials from both streams will be available to all students on the course. Subsequently, the course covers the theory and practice of major topics in bioinformatics, including sequence alignment, genome sequencing, protein sequence models and phylogeny reconstruction. During these topics the major public bioinformatics databases will be used. A range of other topics are covered briefly, leaving students in a position to cover these in more detail through self-study after the course.",

    "summary": "This course introduces statistical approaches to understand the control of trait variation using information from known DNA variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms. These approaches include heritability estimation, QTL mapping using linkage and genome wide association studies and methods that use results from these analyses to predict genetic merit or investigate function.This is a compulsory course for the Quantitative Genetics MSc programmes, forming part of the foundation for the second semester and builds on the courses delivered in the first semester: Population Genetics (PGBI11124), Quantitative Genetics (PGBI11125) and Statistics and Data Analysis (PGBI11003).",
    "course_description": "Overview of main topics:Each week we focus on a different topic starting with an introduction to genomic data, then how it can be used to dissect genetic variation and identify causative loci and finally considering subsequent analyses that can be performed to further our knowledge on the control of complex traits. The methods include heritability estimation, genetic linkage for trait locus mapping and genome wide association studies, we consider study design and the use of imputation and meta-analysis. Finally we introduce post-GWAS approaches such as Mendelian randomisation, polygenic risk scores, LD score regression and the integration of functional information. The course aims to provide the theoretical background to the approaches used and practical experience of performing the analyses.Background knowledge:Students must have taken Population Genetics (PGBI11124) and Quantitative Genetics (PGBI11125), or their equivalent, in order to have a background in genetics and be familiar with the concepts of linkage and linkage disequilibrium, kinship and heritability. We assume that students are familiar with basic statistics including probability, hypothesis testing and estimation using regression, analysis of variance and likelihood. Knowledge of mixed models for genetic data using the relationship matrix is beneficial. Hence we also recommend the courses Quantitative Genetic Models (PGBI11085), Statistics and Data Analysis (PGBI11003). If you haven't taken these courses but are familiar with the background material you should be fine. If you lack some background, it is still possible to succeed in the course but you may have to do additional work/reading to catch up. The data analyses use publicly available software packages, including R. So some familiarity with R would be beneficial.Assessment:Assessment is through in-course assessment (60% of the course mark) and formal examination (40%). The coursework involves taking a set of data through a sequence of analyses (introductory analyses, GWAS and post-GWAS) and the analyses and results written as components of a short paper. Altogether there are four assessments  with the final assessment being the abstract for the complete study.",

    "summary": "Drug discovery often involves the development of computer based models that explain/illustrate the details of the molecular interactions involved. This allows the development of better binding compounds. These models can be a 3D structure of the protein/drug complex, a relationship that links structural aspects to activities, or simplified descriptions of the molecules involved that try to capture some basic aspect of the interaction. These models can then be used to widen the pool of available lead compounds or explain why some compounds show unexpected activity. In all of these models a vital aspect is that it is understood where the weaknesses and strengths of the various models lie and how these models may be validated by experiment.",
    "course_description": "The general idea that a molecular interaction can be modeled in some way and that conclusions can be drawn from that model and tested in some way. A major aspect of the course is to introduce the concept of molecular graphics as a tool to aid in the understanding and analysis of ligand protein interaction. From this the next area is to show that aspects of the forces that drive molecular binding can be derived from the simple analysis of the close atomic interactions made. The concept that compounds that show similar activities to a particular protein, and therefore must have similar profiles leads to molecular similarity in general. While rigorous modelling of the energetics of protein ligand interaction is possible, it is often too time consuming for routine modelling work and the assumption made in simpler models can be outlined. The link can then be made to more complex analysis techniques that can supply the missing binding information. The course will also encompass models of newer biologic drugs and how their binding modes differ from traditional small molecule entities.",

The Phylogenetics course leads you to the current state-of-the-art in the field, starting with a historical overview of phylogenetics. By the end of the course you should be adept at taking raw molecular data and generating phylogenies based on parsimony, bayesian and likelihood methods in a range of software packages. Population genetics focuses on examining the amounts and partitioning of genetic variation and establishing the evolutionary processes underlying population differentiation and diversification. This provides insights into how some groups of populations remain on a common evolutionary trajectory and others diversify into different ecotypes or species. Population genetic approaches are also widely used in conservation programmes in which the conservation of genetic biodiversity is an explicit goal. At the interface of population genetics (diversity and differentiation within species) and phylogenetics (relationships and differentiation between species) is the nature of the species themselves.",
    "course_description": "The course has two distinct parts: 1. Phylogenetics, which covers history of the field and the development of current methods of analysis and considers data types and data acquisition and formatting. It involves a mix of pen-and-paper and computer practicals for analysis of DNA data using parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian methods, trait evolution and ancestral state reconstruction, and molecular dating. It is taught using botanical examples. 2. Population genetics, covers DNA sequencing methods and molecular markers, DNA barcoding, conservation genetics, phylogeography, and the four evolutionary forces (mutation, migration, selection and drift), and HW equilibrium, plus analytical methods in population genetics.",

    "summary": "Biologists have sought to understand patterns of species distribution, richness and endemism across the globe for over two centuries, a field of enquiry called biogeography. Biogeography is the study of species distributions in time (past, current and future) and space (from local to global scales). It is a fascinating field tackling some of the most fundamental questions in biology and biodiversity, and is of crucial importance at the intersection of the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis. Biogeographic research is essential for planning effective conservation strategies and being able to predict how organisms will react to anthropogenic environmental change.",
    "course_description": "This course provides a background to the discipline of plant geography, including an account of its history, overview of basic concepts, as well as explanations of current analytical biogeographic methods used in the three main fields of biogeography (historic, ecological and conservation). This theoretical material is interspersed with examples based upon areas that are under active research at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh and University of Edinburgh. Teaching is lecture based (online or in person as conditions dictate), and will involve some group discussion tutorials, where students will be encouraged to read, interpret, and criticise recently published research articles in the field. Assessment is through written course work in the form of a research proposal, and to support you in this there is one session on how to write a research proposal and past examples given.",

Population genetics is a topic that is fundamental for understanding evolution by natural selection, the genetic basis of variation in natural populations and evolutionary genomics. Population genetics underpins quantitative genetics and therefore animal and plant breeding. This advanced course aims to achieve a thorough understanding of the major concepts in population genetics in order that students will have the foundation for postgraduate studies in evolutionary, human and animal breeding genetics.",
    "course_description": "Introductory sessions will cover basic material in biology and genetics and algebra revision.Students will go on to learn about the origin of variation from mutation, how allele frequencies change and how variation can be maintained by natural selection, the interaction between mutation and selection, genetic load, the genetics of finite populations including the coalescent process, molecular evolution and variation, and the evolutionary implications of linkage disequilibrium. The course will expose students to algebraic reasoning in an applied biological setting, problem solving, logic, attention to detail in calculations, oral paper presentation and scientific report writing summarising the work of others. Teaching is via lectures and associated question and answer sessions, tutorials and problem sessions and group discussions of recent key scientific papers on relevant and interesting topics.",

    "summary": "Population genomic analyses are used to tackle a wide range of fundamental questions in evolutionary biology. Genome scale comparisons of genetic diversity have not only revolutionized our understanding of our own history but are increasingly used in various applied contexts ranging from medical and crop genetics to the modelling of disease outbreaks. This course covers the core concepts of modern population genomic analysis which focuses on modelling the ancestry of samples of genomes. It covers both the mathematical models and computational algorithms that describe the ancestry of genomes in evolving populations and shows how these are applied in practice to make inferences about the interplay of evolutionary forces (genetic drift, recombination, selection and demographic history) from genome sequence data using hands-on data examples.",
    "course_description": "The course assumes a basic understanding of population genetics and is taught as a series of computer practicals which are delivered as interactive jupyter notebooks. The focus is on sample based population genomics which models the ancestral relationships of genomes and the genetic variation these contain. The course includes a detailed exposition of the coalescent, the canonical model of sample ancestry and the relevant data structures (genealogies, tree-sequences and graphs) for describing genetic ancestry. A major aim of the course is to understand how this basic stochastic model can i) be extended to include all fundamental evolutionary forces (recombination, population structure, admixture and natural selection) and ii) is used to make inferences from modern day samples using mathematical analysis, phylogenetics and simulation approaches.",

This courses covers \u00c2\u00bfwet\u00c2\u00bf laboratory work, laboratory bookkeeping, health and safety, scientific writing, numeracy and a small amount of bioinformatic analysis. Practical sessions involve comparison of different methods to determine protein concentrations in solutions and DNA recombinant technology - from primer design, through generation of a recombinant construct, to analysis of DNA sequence of the final product.",
    "course_description": "This course aims to equip you with the fundamental technical and scientific writing skills that are transferable to a laboratory workplace.  This is achieved by using a suite of experiments designed so that you are taught, and get to practice, correct techniques using a range of standard laboratory equipment and generating sets of data, with guidance on how to report and analyse that data.  Although protocols and training are provided, you have to work in pairs and share equipment with other pairs, and the sessions are increasingly less recipe-driven, thus encouraging you to develop independent thought and team-working, organisational and time-management skills.In addition to learning how to measure protein concentrations, the first few weeks give you practice in manipulating small volumes, careful pipetting, repeat measurements, dilution series, and calculations.  The first assessment is a written report of their results which requires you to consider the value of alternative methods to determine protein concentration.  This report also starts to teach you to learn to use correct scientific language and writing style, along with correct notation for reporting numbers (units and significant figures) and some basic statistical analysis of the variability in the class data. You are provided with individual written feedback designed to feed forward to all future scientific writing.The second half of the course is dedicated to generating two recombinant vector constructs for the same gene, using two different approaches in parallel.  You start by learning and using in silico tools to design primers for the initial PCR reactions for a specified gene fragment, given the sequences of the gene and the two target vectors.  Over the next five weeks, you are taught to perform standard molecular biology techniques of PCR; AGE; DNA purification, quantitation, restriction enzyme digest, ligation; transformation, expression and preparation of recombinant DNA for sequencing.  The course ends with analysing the sequencing data from the constructs they have generated.  In addition to learning these techniques, you should also learn the value of good organisational skills required to ensure not only that work can be completed within the practical sessions, but that reagents and samples are clearly labelled and correctly stored for subsequent weeks.  The final assessment is a full experimental write-up of this work in the form of a paper, again to practise using correct scientific language and writing style, and with a strong emphasis on a written description of results that are presented in appropriate and well-annotated figures.",

Students will be trained in how to collect, manage, visualise, communicate about and put in context ecological data that will then be analysed as part of an ecological project, such as an environmental impact assessment. In this course students will develop a diverse set of skills including in-situ and ex-situ (GIS) data acquisition, data management and data visualisation. This course will provide the students with practical experience to combine these varied and complementary elements and integrate them in a single report. These applied skills will be complemented by soft skills, including writing for a variety of media, oral communication for different audiences, interview skills, and an overview of the job market and of funding opportunities in ecology. Students will be encouraged to reflect on the portfolio of hard and soft skills they acquire on this course.",

The interpersonal skills module will enable students to reach their personal goals from an employment perspective.3) Outlook and engagement: One module of this course will be dedicated to the communication of complex, scientific data to a broad audience using a variety of data visualisation tools. It will also include a lecture on writing for different media, to give the students the ability to reach an audience in the policy realm (with policy briefs) or a general audience (with press releases).4) Research and enquiry: The course will combine interrelated lectures, practicals and field work, which will all be combined in a final project. This will enable the students to apply the learned skills, based on real data and published approaches, to make sure they will have the skills to apply state-of-the-art scientific methods to tackle concrete ecological issues resulting from environmental change.5) Personal and intellectual autonomy: The formal course assessment will be in the form of a report, therefore assessing the personal and intellectual autonomy to critically present data in an informative fashion.6) Personal effectiveness: This course will be composed of four different modules, enabling the students to develop their adaptive skills to apprehend and later combine together new topics.7) Communication: The course will include lectures in which students will learn to develop their communication and presentation skills.",

Students will be introduced to statistical mixed models and the use of molecular data in quantitative genetic models. These models and concepts, and the use of the genomic data, are ubiquitous in the analyses of genetic data.This is a compulsory course for the Quantitative Genetics MSc programmes, forming part of the foundation for the second semester.",
    "course_description": "Overview of main topics:The course consists of 10 lectures and associated computer practicals.1. \tIntroduction to mixed models for genetic problems.2. \tGeneralising to the animal model incorporating information from all relatives.3. \tExtending the simple linear model to include repeat records, common environment and maternal effects. Estimating variance components.4. \tMultivariate models. Genetic evaluations.5. \tShrinkage, fixed versus random effects6. \tEstimating effects of loci.7. \tGenomic relationships and their use in genetic evaluations.8. \tGenomic evaluation.9. \tVariances and Bayes models.10. \tAccuracy of genomic evaluation.Assessment:There are four components to the assessment. Quizzes based on each week of lectures (10% of the course mark), two in-course assignments involving data analysis (16% and 24%) and a class test (50%). The class test will take place during the exam period and has questions based on course work and interpretation of analyses.Background knowledge:Students must have taken Population Genetics (PGBI11124) and Quantitative Genetics (PGBI11125), or their equivalent, to provide a background in genetics and familiarity with the concepts of kinship and heritability, allele and genotype frequencies, and additive and dominance effects of alleles.  We assume that students are familiar with basic statistics including linear regression, the ideas of factors and covariates in analysis of variance, and likelihood. Computer practicals are performed in R and models are fitted using the software package ASReml-R.  No familiarity with ASReml is assumed but a basic knowledge of R would be beneficial. A familiarity with very basic matrix concepts is helpful and support for this is available.",

This course explores the rich set of tools that R provides and how in practice these tools can be applied to solve real complex biological problems.    As part of the course we introduce a biological model problem in detail, currently a problem from regulatory genomics, and show how we can build complex analysis processes using R and apply machine learning techniques to model this data.",
    "course_description": "The course is taught from first principles and no previous experience of R is required.   The course begins with an introduction to R and RStudio and also the biological background to the model question and the specific machine learning methods used on the course.  It will go on to explore the R programming model and how in practice scripts and workflows are written in R.  The course will then explore how interactive graphical applications can be build using R and Shiny, how complex relational data can be exploited using R.  It will explore how  data can be imported and processed in R (data cleaning and wrangling) and ultimately how interactive workflows can be run using cluster computing (using Apache Spark).  Finally the course will explore detailed data visualisation and plotting of results (eg using ggplot2) and how the analysis outcome can be interpreted in the context of the motivating biological problem.This course is designed to be complementary to other existing courses that make extensive use of R such as Statistics and Data Analysis (PGBI11003) or Functional Genomic Technologies (PGBI11040).  There is a strong focus on developing real practical generic skills in R that can then be applied to a wide range of biological problems.",

The field project will develop research and enquiry skills as well as require you to demonstrate personal and intellectual autonomy and personal effectiveness.   These skills will also be key for the Plant Science Project in Semester 2.The Plant Science Project will provide an opportunity to develop your skills in research and enquiry, as you investigate a specific problem and experience what routine lab-work is like.  You will learn the specific technical and practical skills required for your project and working alongside other scientists will require good personal effectiveness, team work and time management.  Although you will be given as much guidance as you need, particularly at the start of your project, it is a wonderful opportunity for you to demonstrate your personal and intellectual autonomy as you develop your own approaches to the problems you will encounter.The synoptic examination is an opportunity for you to demonstrate the breadth and depth of your knowledge and understanding and your intellectual autonomy in long answers to wide ranging questions.Electives:A range of technical skills and knowledge is taught by the electives offered in the Plant Science Honours degree, from generating herbicide resistant crops in Intelligent Agriculture to speciation genetics in Plant Evolution and cell wall biochemistry in Plant Growth and Development.  All the electives require considerable individual study and extensive reading, developing research and enquiry skills and requiring personal effectiveness.",

    "course_description": "Evolutionary medicine is an important field that uses the principles of evolutionary biology and ecology to better understand, prevent, and treat infections. At the same time studies of disease can also advance basic knowledge in evolutionary biology and ecology. Pathogen evolution matters because it continually erodes biomedicine\u00c2\u00bfs efforts to control infectious diseases, but using evolutionary and ecological thinking to examine the life-and-death struggle pathogens face with hosts is a surprisingly new area of research.Pathogens, microbes, viruses, parasites (hereafter referred to as parasites) are ubiquitous and the success of a parasitic lifestyle makes them major divers of host evolution. Hosts must combat, or cope with, their parasites using an arsenal of defences. This course will examine the complex problems faced by both parasites and hosts during infections and examine the solutions found by natural selection. By understanding how evolution and ecology can provide new and important insights, we will explore how evolutionary principles can inform human health, veterinary medicine, conservation, and agriculture.We will focus on questions that are the foundations of \"evolutionary medicine\", including: (i) what strategies have parasites evolved to maximise their success and why are some more harmful than others? (ii) how and why do parasites manipulate host behaviours to their own ends? (iii) why do circadian rhythms dictate life or death outcomes during infection? (iv) how do parasites combat drugs and vaccines and are there novel ways to control infections? (v) why do hosts vary in how they cope with disease or spread infection? (vi) what drives the emergence of new diseases and host shifts, and (vii) how can ecology and evolution contribute to addressing the AMR crisis?",

Understanding its causes and consequences is one of the central challenges currently facing by biologists and biomedics.  Evolutionary theory provides a unifying framework with which to study and understand ageing.  This course will offer students a brief overview of the challenge that ageing poses to modern human society, and recent developments in the way we measure and study ageing. We will then discuss in detail evolutionary theories of ageing, which can explain both near universality of the phenomenon of ageing and the great diversity of ageing rates across plant and animal species. Note that this part of the course involves presentation and discussion of mathematical models from evolutionary theory. No prior specific experience with maths or theories are required, but students are required to engage with mathematical models and understand what such models tell us about the evolution of ageing, as a core part of the course. In the second half of the course, we will move onto more specific lectures relating to important topics in the evolutionary study of ageing, including the effects of the environment on ageing, how and why the sexes differ in ageing rates, and the effects of social interactions on the ageing process.  We aim to provide students with an up-to-date understanding of how evolutionary thinking is shaping our understanding of the ageing process.",

This course will investigate how, despite this, elaborate social behaviour and advanced cooperation has evolved from teams of genes cooperating within genomes, to the sophisticated extremes of social insect colonies and the peculiarities of human social life. The course will start by identifying the underlying genetic conflicts, both within individuals at the genomic level, and between individuals interacting within a society. It will then examine the strategies adopted by both genes and individuals to maximise their own success while minimising the risk of exploitation by others. This will include detailed exploration of the different forms of cooperation; will examine the gap between theoretical and empirical analyses; will review recent controversies regarding the importance of kin selection; and will assess the role of information exchange within societies in stabilising conflict. The course will culminate by identifying the major unresolved questions in our understanding of social evolution, and the empirical approaches required to provide robust answers.",

We will also analyse mechanisms in the other segmented phyla, the Chordates (principally the Vertebrates) & the Annelid worms - again looking at evolution within these groups but also comparing with the Arthropods, to ask whether it is more likely that segmentation evolved only once, in a remote common ancestor, or evolved independently within the diverse, distantly-related animal phyla.",

It affects every aspect of our lives, from food security (pollinators, fisheries, crop genetic diversity) and health (pathogen evolution, emergence of zoonotic diseases), to rural economics, sports and leisure (hunting, bird watching, re-wilding) and building materials (forestry). Effectively managing wild populations requires a thorough understanding of the fundamental biology and ecology of populations and communities.The course will build upon basic population and community ecology to provide students with a conceptual toolkit for thinking about managing wild populations. We will start by revising core concepts and exploring how to use them to identify anthropogenic changes and determine their causes. We will then examine the major threats to biodiversity and intervention strategies in response, exploring the different aims, requirements and outcomes of the more commonly used approaches.",
