This   course draws on the concurrent course in Heat, Mass and Momentum  Transfer,  which gives the necessary foundations in mass transfer theory, and also on the previous material in Separation Processes 2 which should have imparted an understanding of the basic graphical methods in binary distillation and absorption as well as the foundations of mass and energy balances. The present  lectures will explore efficient short cut methods for multicomponent     distillation,  absorption, stripping, adsorption, humidification and drying  processes. Both continuous and batch wise operations will be described through  appropriate mass and energy balances and relevant graphical methods. The features of the two main types of equipment for these operations, i.e. trayed and packed towers, will be described and compared. Rate-based mass transfer operations for packed columns will be introduced and employed to design equipment for a range of operations in Chemical Engineering. Finally, the analogy between all the different unit operations covered in the course will be highlighted.",

Topics include the causes of non-ideality, extractive and azeotropic distillation and composition trajectories.Part II:The second half of this course covers adsorption and crystallization processes. The section on adsorption processes is aimed to understand how to design and operate a cyclic adsorption process and estimate its performance. To this end, we apply a mathematical method called Equilibrium Theory to various adsorption systems and learn a graphical method to construct a cyclic adsorption process cycle. The crystallisation process section comprises solid/liquid phase equilibrium, mass and energy balances and the analysis of a crystalliser (MSMPR).",

We work on bridges, tunnels, railways, water supply systems, buildings and flood defences and help tackle many of the big challenges (such as population growth and climate change) that face society.  Civil engineering is a creative discipline that tackles complex problems, underpinned by theory, knowledge, and experience.Civil Engineering 1 starts to develop your technical knowledge by describing theoretical tools that are essential to civil engineers. These include structural analysis (to understand how bridges and buildings stand up), together with methods that describe water, transport, fire, and construction. The course also introduces other tools required in the profession, including design, sustainability and ethics. During the course, students will tackle the design of a large scale hydropower scheme; during the first half of semester they will encounter some of the key ethical and planning issues associated with large scale civil infrastructure; during the second half of semester they will develop an engineering design for a hydropower scheme. These projects introduce the challenges of solving open-ended design problems, and the benefits of group work.",
    "course_description": "A. Behaviour of Solids and StructuresThe behaviour of solid materials and how they react to load underpins all of structural engineering. The Structural engineering lectures will focus on.-\tStatic equilibrium, force resolution, couples and moments (2D and 3D), overall stability.-\tFree body diagrams, internal forces and moments.-\tApplication of free body diagrams to understand the forces within different types of structure (e.g. buildings, bridges, towers, dams).-\tDifferent types of structural form (beams, three-pin arches, suspension and cable-stayed structures).-\tAn introduction to structural materials and assessment of structural strength (based on a simple maximum stress criteria).B. Behaviour of Fluids and FlowsWater is one of the key resources that engineerings must learn how to master. How water is transported and controlled will form a key component of this class.-\tWater: the flow of fluids though aqueducts and pipes and the principles that control this behaviour.-\tContamination and treatment.-\tHydrology and water resources.C. Introductions to other areas of Civil Engineering-\tThe civil engineering profession.-\tHealth, safety and welfare.-\tRisk.-\tEthics in civil engineering.-\tSustainability in civil engineering.-\tThe engineer's toolbox: the role of sketches, drawings, calculations, communication, and computers in civil engineering.The topics introduced in the lectures will be explored and practised in the tutorial sessions.  These will be based on tutorial question sheets that students tackle in their own time, so that they can be discussed during the timetabled tutorial session.  The tutorials will not be marked or assessed, but example solutions will be provided that allow you to self-assess your work.D. ProjectsThe project part of the course will be based around a hydropower scheme. The project will be split into two components (1st half of semester, and 2nd half). During the first half, they key ethical issues that surround the development of such a scheme will be explored. During the second, the students will use their knowledge of structures and fluids, to develop a engineerings design for a hydropower project. These projects involve group work within the timetabled hours, and hence you must attend all of the sessions.",

Science gives us a framework for understanding materials, within which we can include all classes of materials, hence to some extent unifying the treatment of metals, ceramics, polymers and composites. This is materials science. At the heart of materials science is microstructure, which characterises the internal architecture of substances. A description of the composition and internal architecture of materials gives us a basis for understanding engineering properties.By developing a broad knowledge of the underpinning science of materials, and how this links with properties, enables you to apply these concepts in engineering. This often involves thinking carefully, discerning key concepts in a particular situation, and beginning to appreciate the complexities, subtleties and ambiguities that arise when dealing with materials.Learning is through lectures, tutorials, labs, and self study. The tutorials are a chance for students to seek advice and discuss problems set and tackled before the tutorial session.Outline:- Materials Classificationmetals, polymers, ceramics, glass, composites- PropertiesMechanical, thermal, chemical, optical, electricalDefinition, units, quality of data- StructuresStructure on different scalesAtoms, bonding, crystal structures, microstructures- Material classes & materials selectionMetals & alloys, basic concepts in phase diagramsPolymersCeramics, glass, concreteComposites- Behaviour in useDurability, corrosion, deformation and fracture of materials (ductile/brittle behaviour, fracture toughness, creep, fatigue)",

    "course_description": "Engineers design things. The 'things' that engineers design range from mile-high skyscrapers to underwater vehicles, from flood prevention schemes for informal settlements, to wind turbines, from single use PPE for hospitals to 100-year city strategies. We design things that need to fit into and strengthen our existing infrastructure. Engineering, therefore, is fundamentally creative, and Tools for Engineering Design 2 helps develop the skills needed for Engineering Design.A key aspect of design is that there are no single correct answers. It is relatively straightforward to come up with a solution that works; the challenge for a good designer is to come up with the 'best' solution. That is not straightforward: some solutions might be impractical or unsafe to build, some might use materials that cannot be found locally, some will be very expensive or poor aesthetically. Designers often work with incomplete information, a Client who changes their mind part way through the project, or contradicting requirements. Iteration is always needed to find the 'best' design solution.Tools for Engineering Design 2 helps students develop a 'toolbox' of strategies for tackling open-ended design problems. The course introduces the challenges of iterative design through short group projects and tasks. The projects gradually build students' awareness of and confidence in tackling conceptual design problems, a thread that is fundamental through engineering degree programmes.The course covers:- What is design?- Communication (drawings, group work, meetings, discussion)- Self-led learning exercises- Design, build, re-design project- Master planning project- Upgrade project- Reflection exercise on what you have learnt on this course.As well as learning about the design process, students learn specific skills required by a designer: how drawings can be used at different stages of design; good team-working practices; and using simple tools to optimise solutions.The course is taught through project work with discussion and critique of the various projects providing feedback to develop students' design skills.",

This design process is intertwined with Engineering Sustainability: the design must not only address the client's needs, but also a wide range of other project drivers such as cost, end-of-life decommissioning, social impact, buildability, and environmental impact.Conceptual Design and Sustainability for Civil Engineers 3 develops students confidence in creative design and concept generation through a series of open-ended design tasks. It build upon the skills learnt in Tools for Engineering Design 2 (CIVE08020); however, students have learnt a large range of analytical skills between completing TED2 and starting CDSCE3, and the course will examine how engineers apply those analytical methods in a manner appropriate for conceptual design.Sustainability is examined as an inherent part of the design process for the built environment, including the way sustainability interacts  with the needs of project stakeholders (such as clients, government and the general population). The concept of design drivers is used in the course to explore how the best possible design solution to a problem depends upon which of the drivers are decided to be most important.The design projects require students to develop their verbal, visual, and written communication skills, which are an integral part of design within a team.",

It firstly extends from earlier structural mechanics knowledge on deflection of beams to the general analysis of deflections in statically determinate structures, with an emphasis on the method of virtual work. This is followed by the analysis of indeterminate structures using the force method (flexibility method); analysis of indeterminate structures using the displacement method, including the slope-deflection method and moment distribution method. It then proceeds to the matrix stiffness method for structural analysis using the direct stiffness approach, and the general aspects of structural modelling and computer analysis. The course provides a comprehensive cover of the fundamental principles, analysis techniques and practical skills that are required in modern structural analysis applications. Students will also develop a deep appreciation of the interlinks between different methods of structural analysis.",

It  takes  a  step back from the structural mechanics methods taught elsewhere in the curriculum, such as Structural Mechanics 2 and Structural Analysis 3, and examines  the  design philosophy behind these techniques.    For  example,  why  and  when  is  it  safe  to  make assumptions  and  simplifications  in design;  how  do  different structural  forms  carry  load;  which  structural  form  is  best  to meet  a  particular  functional  requirement?    Modern  trends  in structural  engineering  involve  using  materials  that  are  more brittle, or more prone to buckling, or lighter and thinner; what are  the  implications  of  these  modern  forms  for  structural design?The  course  builds upon  the  analysis  methods  covered  in 2nd year and 3rd year, and is intended for any student intending to specialise in structural engineering, or any student who wants to  go  beyond  the  equations  or  software  that are  used  for general structural analysis and design.",

    "summary": "\"Digitalisation\" has been transforming the construction industry in the last decade. Driven by the benefits of well-structured digital information during both the construction and the operational phase of built environment assets (buildings or infrastructure), construction projects are now effectively being delivered in two ways: physically and digitally. Terminology often used for this transformation includes \"Building Information Modelling\" or BIM, Information Management, and/or Digital Twinning, to name a few. This requires modern civil and construction engineers to be equipped with the skills to (1) produce and make use of smart, digital models of construction assets, and (2) work collaboratively with multiple other professionals through the exchange and delivery of structured digital information. The course will equip the students with the knowledge and skills and will do so through a combination of lectures, computer lab activities, combining individual and group work.",

It involves a substantial design project that mimics the real-world feasibility design of a bridge in a civil engineering design consultancy.

    "course_description": "Structural Engineering Design Project 4 mimics the real-world design of a bridge in a civil engineering consultancy. Students work within design teams to carry out a feasibility study for a new bridge, involving all aspects of the design process from the initial concept through to detailed design. One of the principle aims of the project is to draw together subjects learnt during the degree programme, to remind students of methods that they have perhaps forgotten, and to make sure they could start work in a real design office.As in any real design situation, however, it will also be necessary to learn new skills to tackle the project, and in this case that will involve self-led study of aspects of bridge engineering (including construction methods, costs, Eurocodes for bridge design, and computer analysis tools). The project has been developed over many years with the help of experienced senior bridge engineers, based on the skills that are needed by graduate engineers in their practices and upon the type of problem that an engineer needs to be able to tackle to become chartered.  The range and depth of tasks that students tackle will be appropriate to a BEng degree.The project is split into two parts.  During the first week students work on the Outline Design for two different concepts, which will involve selecting the most appropriate design tools to explore and develop the designs. During the second week, students proceed with the Detailed Design of one of these solutions, and there are opportunities for members of the design team to focus on different aspects of the detailed design (such as examining safe construction methods, or detailed modelling of a specific aspect of the bridge).The course runs full-time for the first two weeks of semester 2.To help lead students through the task, the project is split in to three submission stages, with a series of structured briefing, presentation, and review sessions.  The timetable for these sessions is adjusted depending upon the availability of the industry experts who assist with the project, and will be confirmed at the start of the course. Typically:WEEK 1Monday am: Initial briefing and industry expert briefing.Tuesday pm: Design Scheme Brainstorm.Wednesday pm: Discussion session with Industry Expert.Friday pm: presentation of outline designs and submission A (outline design, group work) due.WEEK 2Monday am:  Review meetings and Industry Expert briefing.Monday pm: Review meetingsFriday pm: detailed design handover meetings and submission B (detailed design, group work).Submission C involves individual reflection upon the design problem, due at the end of week 4.Surgery hours will be arranged for each group to discuss with the course lecturer throughout the course duration.",

    "course_description": "The teaching of engineering at the UoE, as elsewhere, tends to emphasise the application of scientific principles at the expense of broader social aspects of engineering knowledge and practice. Although engineering provides rigorous tools for addressing complex societal goals, there is little formal teaching with regard to the way these goals are understood. This course will fill this gap by providing students with a range of conceptual tools (illustrated with examples from many fields of engineering and technological development) geared towards understanding the ways that social factors influence engineering (especially fire safety engineering) practice. In addition, the understandable tendency in engineering to quantification and calculation can obscure the central roles of choice and judgement in engineering practice. This course will therefore also address the ways that the knowledge claims used in engineering are socially constructed and organisationally mediated, and why this matters for engineering outcomes.The course has two main aims. First, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the social context of fire safety engineering with regard to issues such as the socioeconomic factors that contribute to fire risk and its understanding and the history and rationale of regulatory practices. Second, to stimulate the students to interrogate and debate taken-for-granted aspects of engineering practice, and thus to be more reflexive about the basis of the claims generated and used in fire safety engineering.The course will be structured as follows:1. Introduction. Set out broad principles and methods of sociology of knowledge approach and why it is central to understanding both the effects of fire, and fire safety science and engineering practice.2. History of major disasters and effects on regulation and practice.3. Epidemiology and statistics. Socioeconomic causes of fire outcomes.4. Development of regulation in 20th century. Emergence of life safety (vs property) and role of public and private institutions.5. Testing. Standard fire testing and its implications for knowledge and practice.6. Evidence and Governance: Sprinklers and smoke alarms7. Limits of building control. Why people, practice, and social organisation matter. Example of fire in informal settlements.8. Performance Based Design. The significance of 'expertise asymmetry' in regulation, and the role of professionalisation.9. Judgment and Risk. Quantification, optimisation, and spurious precision.10.

    "summary": "This course provides an introduction to research and research methods in general. This is done through a consideration of the process of research and a detailed overview of the methods which are appropriate to the students in the programme. The course will also consider practical aspects of research dissemination using visual (poster) and written documents.",
    "course_description": "Course topics include:Problem identification and framing- Research is presented as a transformative process, moving the doer and the user of research from a position of need to knowledge. The nature of this 'need' or demand is understood, allowing the student to appreciate their research domain in terms of who the beneficiaries are, why the research is needed and what difference it will make. This allows research to be 'framed' and generates candidates for the aims and research questions for investigation.Literature and industry context- Before a plan for research is finalised, and before the research intentions are understood, the specific context of both scholarly theory and industry practice need to be appreciated. Traditionally this is known as the 'Literature Review', though we will explore the use of that term and appreciate its fuller purpose. Sessions here will consider the process of literature discovery and identifying gaps in the knowledge of the problem domain. This part of the course will also focus on the reviewing of literature and critical writing.Academic publishing and dissemination- In combination with the previous topic of understanding the problem domain context, this part of the course will provide additional value through a review of the academic publishing process, from writing, to peer-review, open-access, impact and contribution. This part of the course will allow a broader and more nuanced understanding of the purpose of academic and research, allowing students to place their own work, its needs and contributions in a wider and more holistic context. It will also introduce the concept of research ethics, from both the view point of protecting the research subject and also of integrity in research practice.Research philosophy and methodology- The possible approaches to research are extremely broad and choices are made dependent on the problem itself and what is hoped to be achieved. This session will first explore the pluralism in research, understanding that there are 'natural science' and 'social science' paradigms. It will consider the issues of how we know, or epistemology, together with more philosophical issues such as how we know what exists or ontology. Students will understand how these concepts affect how they might approach their investigations and lead to questions over interpretivist or positivist frameworks.Research methods- As a direct follow-on from methodology students will then understand the more pragmatic aspects of how research is to be done. Methods will be presented from deductive or inductive and exploratory or explanatory viewpoints. The concepts of qualitative or quantitative study are explored and understanding of common research methods, particularly for quantitative work, will be provided.Analysis tools- Some common tools associated with qualitative and quantitative research are presented. Students will understand that the tools chosen will match the research paradigms previously set. Instruction in the use of statistical tools and thematic analysis in particular will be provided.Interpretation, making sense, conclusion and contribution- The whole purpose of research is explored again which results in the understanding that research has no value if its outcomes are not explored and its contribution not captured. This process is referred to as 'making-sense' and is as important in qualitative as quantitative work. The interpretation and making sense phase of research leads to concepts such as discussion and conclusion in academic writing; or executive summary and recommendations in technical writing.Academic dissemination- Finally the course will provide guidance and instruction in the process of academic writing and the production of a final thesis or dissertation.- Other forms of dissemination will also be covered, including conference poster and presentationThe course will be assessed by the preparation of a Literature Review that includes:- An encapsulation of a relevant problem area or 'research domain' that allows a problem identification and definition- A clear identification of both the beneficiaries of their proposed work and what the benefit will potentially be- An understanding of the academic and industrial context of their proposed work",

It involves a substantial design project that mimics the real-world feasibility design of a bridge in a civil engineering design consultancy.

    "course_description": "Structural Engineering Design Project 5 mimics the real-world design of a bridge in a civil engineering consultancy. Students work within design teams to carry out a feasibility study for a new bridge, involving all aspects of the design process from the initial concept through to detailed design. One of the principle aims of the project is to draw together subjects learnt during the degree programme, to remind students of methods that they have perhaps forgotten, and to make sure they could start work in a real design office.As in any real design situation, however, it will also be necessary to learn new skills to tackle the project, and in this case that will involve self-led study of aspects of bridge engineering (including construction methods, costs, Eurocodes for bridge design, and computer analysis tools). The project has been developed over many years with the help of experienced senior bridge engineers, based on the skills that are needed by graduate engineers in their practices and upon the type of problem that an engineer needs to be able to tackle to become chartered.  The range and depth of tasks that students tackle will be appropriate to a MEng degree.Students will be working in group to work on the Outline Design for two different concepts, which will involve selecting the most appropriate design tools to explore and develop the designs.  Then students will proceed with the Detailed Design of one of these solutions, and there are opportunities for members of the design team to focus on different aspects of the detailed design (such as examining safe construction methods, or detailed modelling of a specific aspect of the bridge).The course runs full-time for three weeks in semester 2.To help lead students through the task,  a series of structured briefing, presentation, consultation and review sessions will be organised.  The timetable for these sessions is adjusted depending upon the availability of the industry experts who assist with the project, and will be confirmed at the start of the course.There will also be a submission that involves individual reflection upon the design problem.It will also be possible to book meetings with the course lecturer to discuss the project.",

The application of the method to elasticity problems is then developed from fundamental principles. Specific classes of problems are then discussed based on abstractions and idealisations of 3D solids, such as plane stress and strain, Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beams and Kirchoff and Mindlin-Reissner plates and shells.

    "summary": "An introduction to digital electronic circuits and systems. The lectures presume a basic knowledge of the current/voltage properties of resistors, capacitors and MOS transistors and some simple properties of number. Starting with the creation of the discrete binary abstraction from continuous voltage/time circuits, the lectures cover the representation of information in simple codes and sequences of codewords, and the definition and design of logic gate networks and modules for processing such information. Simple tools and techniques are used to study the principles of analysis and design at the transistor, logic gate, register transfer and algorithmic levels of organisation. The features of implementation fabric and their influence on the design process is revealed.",

It  relies  on  a  key  understanding  of  sensor  networks  and  how  they  communicate,    resource    and    computation    constraints,    and    an    understanding of how data is sampled and then analysed. Signals are the output of sensors which have measured data, and this course gives an introduction to key signal analysis concepts.This course aims to introduce students to the fundamentals of Sensor Networks, Signal Processing, Communication, and Information Theory. The course aims to provide an insight into time domain and frequency domain analysis of continuous-time signals, and provide an insight into the  sampling  process  and  properties  of  the  resulting  discrete-time signals.    The    course    then    introduces    the    students    to    basic    communication  modulation  techniques,  as  well  as  probability  theory  for  analysing  random  signals.  At  the  end  of  the  module  students  will  have acquired sufficient expertise in these concepts to appreciate how sensor  networks  and  signal  analysis  can  be  used  in  a  variety  of  disciplines.",

    "summary": "This course will introduce students to embedded systems that are widely used in many engineering applications. These devices need to be programmed to operate correctly, typically using a software language such as C. They also need to be able to interface with and process both analogue and digital signals. The course provides an introduction to all of these concepts for students with an interest in Electronic systems.",
    "course_description": "This course provides an introduction to both the programming of embedded devices and how they interact with all types of analogue and digital signals. The course therefore splits into two major parts to deal with both of these topics:In the first part, students will learn the important elements of an imperative programming language, C, that can be used to program an embedded system. They will also undertake exercises making use of those features in a modular programming style. Students will develop knowledge and skills with which to analyse and solve engineering problems by application of numerical analysis techniques.In the second part, students will study how an embedded device can handle both analogue and digital signals. This part of the course will be based around simulation software, with reinforcement via laboratory examples where possible. Students will explore how embedded systems can interact with real world analogue signals. They will also study how embedded processors can communicate in a digital format with other electronic devices.",

The exercise involves designing analogue circuits for the implementation of an end-to-end optical signal transmission through free-space and a guide plastic optical fibre channel.",
    "course_description": "In this course emphasis will be on hands-on learning through experimentation. The fundamental properties of optical communications will be taught at the start of course; including signal attenuation in fibre, dispersion/pulse spreading and LED/Laser comparison and photo-detection.The course is designed to use knowledge gained by students in the earlier years of their course and aims to act a \"structured project\". The course is structured so as to act as an introduction to the more open ended type of final year project work carried out in the fourth and fifth years. Until this point in the course the students experience is largely of analysis of circuits supplied to them. In this exercise students are expected to synthesise their own designs and realise their own circuitry.Assessment of this course will be based on: (1) a written report by the students explaining their design and the function of each subsystem. This report will be expected to include the circuit diagrams, design equations and a complete list of components and their values. In addition, the report should contain student attempts to specific questions in the provided laboratory script. (2) The PCB layout, efficient use of space on the PCB, good soldering/component placement on the PCB. (3) Finally, the design functionality. It is expected that, with the implemented design, it should be possible to achieve an end-to-end optical signal transmission over plastic optical fibre and demonstrate LiFi audio signal transmission. Assessment is based on the measured performance metrics stated in the lab manual and quality of the LiFi audio signal transmission.",

    "summary": "The Biosensor Instrumentation course examines the methods used to interface sensors for biological and biomedical applications with electronics.  One focus will be on transducers, meaning devices which convert information from one form of energy to another.  In this case the final form for the information will be an electrical signal but the transducers themselves could be optical, mechanical, etc., and operate in a number of different ways (eg., capacitive, potentiometric, photonic).  The objective is to build upon the knowledge the students will have gained in the 4th year introductory courses on bioelectronics and biosensors but with more of an electronics and electrical engineering focus.  This course will also go beyond sensing to look at methods of actuation for closed loop \"smart\" systems.  Examples from the state of the art in biosensor research will be provided and a number of guest lectures from active researchers in this field will provide context.",
    "course_description": "There are two lectures each week.  The main body of the course will run from weeks 1-10 with the lecture slots taken up with coursework presentations in week 11.  2-3 guest lectures are planned during the semester with timings to be determined.  These will cover active research in the field of biosensing and in previous years have looked at: \"cantilever based biosensors\", \"advanced photodetector arrays\" and \"electrical cell impedance sensing\".Lectures:The following subjects will be covered during the course, Most of these will take more than one lecture slot:L1.\tTransducer Basics: Sensors and ActuatorsL2.\tSensor Amplification: Op-amps, basic circuitsL3.\tInstrumentation for Electrochemistry: Potentiostats, impedance measurements, bridge circuitsL4.\tTemperature measurementsL5.\tMechanical sensor instrumentation: Strain gauges, piezoelectric sensors and actuators, capacitive sensor interfacesL6.\tFET based sensors: MOSFET revision, FET based biosensors, nano-wire sensors.L7.\tOverview of optical biosensors: Fibre-optic sensors, fluorescenceL8.\tNeural sensors and actuators: Microelectrode arrays, neural implantsL9.\tImplantable medical devices: Biofouling, materials and regulationL10.\tWireless sensor interfaces: Sensor networks and wireless power",

An important aspect of bioelectronics is the development of a communication interface between biological materials (cells, tissue and organs) and electronic components.",
    "course_description": "This course introduces the biochemical, biophysical and physiological concepts that are of relevance to bioelectronics, it also provides instruction in the basic science and engineering concepts required to understand the design and application of biosensors.Biosensors are defined as self-contained integrated devices capable of providing analytical information, using a biological recognition element in conjunction with a secondary transduction element. Different biosensor systems are explored, ranging from electrochemical devices, through to optical or thermal systems. Instruction is also given in the general principles of sampling and analysis, statistical presentation and manipulation of data acquired by biosensors.Finally this course examines the methods used to interface sensors for biological and biomedical applications with electronics. One focus will be on transducers, meaning devices which convert information from one form of energy to another. In this course the final form for the information will be an electrical signal but the transducers themselves could be optical, mechanical, etc., and operate in a number of different ways (eg., capacitive, potentiometric, photonic).This introductory course provides background that will be of particular use for the Semester 2 lab-on-chip technologies course.",

Such advantages include: low fluid volumes that lead to lower reagent costs and smaller biological samples for diagnostic purposes; faster analysis and response times that also provide better process control; the ability through parallel processing to provide high-throughput screening; and inherent low fabrication costs that make disposable chips economically viable. The influence of the scaling-down of dimensions on the physico-chemical behaviour of fluids and chemical reactions will also be covered. Current applications of lab-on-chip devices will be given.",

    "course_description": "The structural mechanics part of the course will consist of:-17 1-hour lectures + 5 1-hour example classes;-1 laboratory session (2 hours each group of students) with 1 group assignment.The structural dynamics part of the course will consist of:-17 1-hour lectures + 5 1-hour example classes;-1 laboratory session (2 hours each group of students) with 1 group assignment.Structural mechanics:We will focus on the behaviour of solid materials and structures under load and stress. This part includes the following elements: revision of second year core material (calculation of sectional properties), shear force and bending moment diagrams and bending stress;introduction of the ideas of structural modelling and loading actions; illustration of complex stresses  on inclined sections and introduce graphical method of stress calculation; work on beams to cover practical cases  of unsymmetric bending;introduction of the concept of shear centre and its calculation;introduction of the idea of strain energy;introduction of energy methods as an alternative  approach to the use of differential equations in stress analysis;use of Unit Load and Castigliano's Method in solving simple structural problems.Structural dynamics:We will focus on mechanical vibrations of structures,which can be modelled as systems of discrete elements,thus providing the students with the tools for evaluating oscillations of real-world mechanical systems. We will investigate rigid body (lumped parameter) linear systems where the dynamic behaviour can be described using one or more spatial coordinates (single and multiple degrees of freedom systems). Students will be able to write the equation of motions of freely vibrating systems or under external exciting force in order to evaluate displacements, frequencies of oscillation, force transmitted and modes of vibration. We will be looking at issues arising from mechanical oscillations in real-world systems (i.e., IC engines, shafts, bridges and high-rise buildings) and devise solutions to minimise (or maximise!) mechanical vibrations. MATLAB will be used as additional and powerful tool to facilitate the procedure to investigate the mechanical oscillations of the studied systems.Lectures and example classes list:1.

    "summary": "The Dynamics 4 course provides an understanding of core aspects of advanced dynamic analysis, dealing with system modelling, dynamic response and vibration analysis, structural dynamics both in the linear and non-linear regimes, wave propagation and the dynamics of continuous and multi-degree of freedom systems. The main objective is to obtain an understanding and appreciation of the potential and limitations of analytical approaches and solutions, and the value of these in underpinning modern computer methods for simulating dynamic structural response.",
    "course_description": "The Dynamics 4 course covers the following three main subject areas:1. The Lagrange method of analytical dynamics. This is a formal approach for setting up equations of motion (EoM) for complex dynamic systems with dynamic constraints (e.g. constrained motions). Free Body Diagrams (FBD) prove quite difficult when dealing with complex systems which operate under dynamic constraints. Lagrange's method, however, allows the derivation of correct Equations of Motion through formal calculations from the energy functions of the system. Covered applications include the analysis of the conditions for dynamic system stability.2. Wave propagation in continuous systems. Systematic approaches for deriving the parameters of lumped-parameter descriptions. Properties of wave propagation, including sound propagation, and the standing waves which characterise the fundamental vibration modes of continuous systems with boundaries. Longitudinal and transverse waves and solutions to the corresponding differential equations (e.g. standing and travelling wave solutions)3. Vibration of multi-degree-of-freedom systems, using the more formal approach of principal coordinate analysis to describe vibration behaviour, and to analyse vibration hazards in engineering structures.[AHEP outcomes: SM2m, EA1m, EA3m]",

As many engineering problems are solved in teams, the student will learn to solve engineering problems as a team.  Therefore, students are allocated into teams of 4-6 and assigned an academic supervisor.This course has three main objectives:1.\tTo give students the experience of working as a member of a team carrying out a major project. Within industrial & research environments, almost all work is undertaken in teams.2.\tTo improve the studentÂ¿s communication and inter-personal skills through reporting and formally presenting his/her analysis and findings.3. \tTo serve as a vehicle for integrating the necessary technical subject materials in order to reach the projectÂ¿s goals.In order to meet these objectives each group is expected to:A.\tIdentify, select, collate and evaluate relevant information from a variety of sources for their project.B.\tGive short, professionally presented seminars on the aspects of their project.C.\tDiscuss the importance of technical and non-technical aspects of engineering towards their project.D.\tWrite a clear, well-presented report containing critical assessment of the information they have found and setting it in context with sound conclusions.E.\tHave a final presentation (oral exam) to describe, support and critically praise the aspects of their project.The students are assessed based on a video pitch (10%), final presentation (10%) and a final written report (80%).The AHEP learning outcomes for this course are: SM1b, SM3b, EA1b, P1, P2, P4, P11, G1, G4",

This course introduces students to the fundamental theory of the finite element method as a general tool for numerically solving differential equations for a wide range of engineering problems. Field problems described by the Laplace, and Poisson equations are presented first and all steps of the FE formulation are described. Specific applications in heat transfer are demonstrated. The application of the method to elasticity problems is then developed from fundamental principles. Specific classes of problems are then discussed based on abstractions and idealisations of 3D solids, such as plane stress and strain, Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beams and Kirchoff and Mindlin-Reissner plates and shells. Special topics such as multiple constraints and substructuring are introduced.",

    "summary": "The tissues that make up the human body display extraordinary characteristics; self-assembly, self-healing, adaptive and sometimes actuatable. This course looks into the source of these characteristics and then considers what materials we, as engineers, can use to replace them. We will focus attention on the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems of the body and the biomaterials that have been developed for use as substitutes. We'll consider how the body reacts to the presence of man-made biomaterials and the impact of the need for biomaterial sterilisation. Not all replacement materials are man-made; we'll think about tissue engineering as a way to grow new tissue. Finally, we'll introduce the legal processes surrounding regulation of biomaterial use and consider the ethics of growing new body parts.",

It sets renewable energy in the wider context and develops a basic qualitative and quantitative toolkit for appraising technologies and carrying out basic design of energy systems. It examines each of the major technologies covering aspects such as: resource, conversion technologies, environmental impacts and commercial, social and regulatory constraints. Finally it briefly examines how renewables can be integrated effectively within the energy system.The course provides sufficient depth and coverage to build a comprehensive understanding of renewable energy whilst acting as an introduction to more specialist courses on individual technology areas (e.g. wind energy). It also introduces engineering design processes and methodologies, through an exploration of the varied practices of designing sustainable energy installations across a range of technologies. The course material requires numeracy and knowledge of basic physics concepts.The course deals mainly with renewable electricity generation and its role but includes some material on renewable heat; nuclear and conventional power is excluded.The course is based on lectures and reading material that provide an efficient summary of key material and techniques, supported by interactive Seminars and Examples Classes. These are further supplemented by tutorial questions and text books. The course is challenging and requires hard work.",

    "summary": "The Advanced Power Engineering Dissertation is a substantial piece of practical research, or industrial design, which will give the students of the 2-year MSc Programme in Advanced Power Engineering experience in applying knowledge and understanding gained in their first year of taught study, as well as increasing the student's competence in a particular area of Electrical Power Engineering. The objective output of a project is a novel design, or empirical knowledge, the extent of attainment of which forms part of the overall assessment.",
    "course_description": "Skills and attitudes appropriate to the professional engineer, developed in pursuit of the objective output, are just as important and are given corresponding weight in the assessment of the Advanced Power Engineering Dissertation. The project is structured into two phases corresponding to the standard teaching semesters, with two separately defined work packages but with the two phases being closely and integrally related.The topics are allocated to the students towards the start of the 1st semester of year 2, and Phase 1 research work begins immediately afterwards. Working together with their supervisor by  early October they devise a plan to carry out the research and they then submit the project Mission Statement. The students are expected to hold meetings with their supervisors on a weekly basis and work in close collaboration with their research groups.Following an initial literature review, the main phase of the research work starts mid-October. By mid-November, a project seminar will take place, during which students present their plans for their research and expected outcomes. The expectancy is that by the end of Phase 1 the students will have developed the required theoretical and practical skills, carried out a literature review and initiated the development of the main body of their work (software, hardware, methodologies etc.). Work carried out in Phase 1 is assessed by means of an 8 page literature review  formatted as a journal paper, while students also submit a 2 page statement of achievement describing the work the carried out in the first semester and setting out a plan for Phase 2 of the project.Research work continues in Phase 2 over the 2nd semester of year 2. By the first week of February, students will have arranged and taken an one-to-one interview with their project examiner. where they will have the opportunity to receive feedback on their Phase 1 submission, while a 2nd presentation of their progress will be arranged at the end of February. The work is completed in the final week of April when students submit  a 10 page research paper as well as a final statement of achievement, and present their work to the School at an open event attended by staff and students of the Institute of Energy Systems.",

    "summary": "The Biosensors and Instrumentation course examines the methods used to interface sensors for biological and biomedical applications with electronics.  One focus will be on transducers, meaning devices which convert information from one form of energy to another.  In this case the final form for the information will be an electrical signal but the transducers themselves could be optical, mechanical, etc., and operate in a number of different ways (eg., capacitive, potentiometric, photonic).  The objective is to build upon the knowledge the students will have gained in the introductory courses in semester 1 on bioelectronics and biosensors but with more of an electronics and electrical engineering focus.  This course will also go beyond sensing to look at methods of actuation for closed loop \"smart\" systems.  Examples from the state of the art in biosensor research will be provided and a number of guest lectures from active researchers in this field will provide context.  Students will undertake a \"horizon scanning\" research exercise to investigate the industrial and research potential of a specific type of biosensor.  This will be assessed by both formal reports and a presentation given to and marked by the whole class.",
    "course_description": "There are two lectures each week.  The main body of the course will run from weeks 1-10 with the lecture slots taken up with coursework presentations in week 11.  2-3 guest lectures are planned during the semester with timings to be determined.  These will cover active research in the field of biosensing and in previous years have looked at: \"cantilever based biosensors\", \"advanced photodetector arrays\" and \"electrical cell impedance sensing\".Lectures:The following subjects will be covered during the course, Most of these will take more than one lecture slot:L1.\tTransducer Basics: Sensors and ActuatorsL2.\tSensor Amplification: Op-amps, basic circuitsL3.\tInstrumentation for Electrochemistry: Potentiostats, impedance measurements, bridge circuitsL4.\tTemperature measurementsL5.\tMechanical sensor instrumentation: Strain gauges, piezoelectric sensors and actuators, capacitive sensor interfacesL6.\tFET based sensors: MOSFET revision, FET based biosensors, nano-wire sensors.L7.\tOverview of optical biosensors: Fibre-optic sensors, fluorescenceL8.\tNeural sensors and actuators: Microelectrode arrays, neural implantsL9.\tImplantable medical devices: Biofouling, materials and regulationL10.\tWireless sensor interfaces: Sensor networks and wireless power",

Changes in Scottish Government guidance may make it impossible to run the course in September, or restrictions may require us to restrict the numbers that can take the course.Please be assured that we want to ensure you have the best possible experience if you take this course.This course introduces CFD by means of a set of lectures covering the background physics and mathematics, together with practical assignments that use commercial CFD software to solve flow problems. The need for error control and independent validation of results is stressed throughout. Although particular software (Star-CCM+) is used for the assignments, the underlying themes of the module are generic.",

Students will be exposed to both practitioners and academics who have experienced and studied the performance of major programme delivery - successful and unsuccessful.The course will be taught through a series of lectures and workshops that highlight different approaches to the design and performance measurement of delivery enterprises, in a variety of industries across various cultures. It will be delivered in a 3-day intensive block with subsequent course work and examination. Key lecture topics:1.\tApproaches to the design of enterprises for the delivery of major programmes: a survey of organisational structures adopted for major programmes across different sectors, with critical insights into advantages and disadvantages2.\tInforming the decision-making and choices for the design of delivery enterprises. Designing the right model for successful outcomes.3.\tMeasuring enterprise capability: approaches and methods adopted - CMMI; the IPA Route map, etc. Best practice techniques for capability review;4.\tBenefits realisation management - risk or reward? Using benefits realisation to assist in managing expectations and outcomes.5.\tAssessing the appropriate time to redesign delivery enterprises. Projects and programmes evolve, and organisational structures may need to evolve with them. Recognising the right time to make changes is a key leadership skill.Workshops will be used to explore in an interactive forum:- deeper dives into case studies with the support and involvement of senior practitioners with direct experience of major programme delivery- a scenario-based exercise to simulate issues and challenges of dealing with change on a major programme and how that stress-tests enterprise capability- how leaders should behave and perform within an effective delivery organisation.",

It will explore the roles which entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship play in influencing how new opportunities are identified, shaped and taken to the market through the formation of new organisations or the integration of innovation into existing organisational forms, examining the role which innovative and enterprising individuals play in managing and leading innovation and organisational development. The importance of soft skills in these processes, such as networking and negotiation, will also be considered. Students will learn through a range of means, including on-line material, learning through the interactive workshops and reflection on practices within their own and other placement organisations.The 10-credit course, offered in Semester 1 of Year 2, will combine face-to-face learning supported through some on-line delivery.  It will provide students with knowledge and skills to understand better the commercial context of their industry-based CDT placement, making them better-placed to integrate into and contribute more effectively within their organisation from an early stage. Students will engage in independent self-study at the start of their placement and meet during Semester 1 for a total of four days of intensive, residential bootcamp-style learning, divided across two blocks with several weeks between (likely to be 2.5 days for Part One and 1.5 days for Part Two.  Guest speakers contributing to sessions across the four days will bring vital practitioner perspectives to enrich the learning environment.

As many engineering problems are solved in teams, the student will learn to solve engineering problems as a team. Therefore, students are allocated into teams of 4-6.This course has three main objectives:1. To give students the experience of working as a member of a team carrying out a project. Within industrial & research environments, almost all work is undertaken in teams.2. To improve the student's communication and inter-personal skills through reporting and formally presenting his/her analysis and findings.3. To serve as a vehicle for integrating the necessary technical subject materials in order to reach the project's goals.",

    "summary": "The emerging discipline of ecological engineering is a response to the growing need for engineering practice to provide for human welfare while at the same time protecting the natural environment from which goods and services are drawn. Ecological engineering is the design of sustainable systems, consistent with ecological principles.Focused towards Offshore Energy Infrastructure (OEI) projects, this course will incorporate five design principles to guide practical ecological engineering. The principles are: (1) design consistent with ecological principles, (2) design for site-specific context, (3) maintain the independence of design functional requirements, (4) design for efficiency in energy and information, and (5) acknowledge the values and purposes that motivate design.The course will include lectures, mini-projects and site visits, taking full advantage of the range of capabilities available within the consortium.",
    "course_description": "Eco-engineering starts from dedicated pre-project environmental monitoring, recognizing key environmental values and the presence and resilience of sensitive systems at an early stage. The planning, consenting and consequent installation of Offshore Energy Infrastructure often requires detailed environmental studies prior to the installation, during installation and during the operation. Base line studies will inform potential environmental concerns and impacts, providing a thorough understanding and increase the overall value of the project both for nature, society and the project itself related to economics and profitability during operational lifetime. The inclusion of Eco-Engineering approaches allows the optimization of project design and implementation of adaptive work methods with the objective to enhance habitat and ensure minimal impact whilst enhancing beneficial gains.The course will prepare for Eco-Engineering processes relevant to Offshore Energy Infrastructure projects that are often placed in sensitive marine environments that ask for responsible and innovative project approaches. The approaches considered will need to enable minimizing impacts in the broadest sense and compensating any residual negative effects, whilst enabling the realization of the infrastructure installation through an eco-friendly approach as part of the design, processes and choice of materials. The learning outcomes will focus towards eco-friendly and integrated design processes and choice of materials and sub-systems; as well as the consideration of the inclusion of stakeholders and decision-making processes (i.e. regulatory requirements).The course will be designed to build in relevant examples of pilots and case studies and students will learn from real experience, and will be asked to create scenarios developing notional Offshore Energy Infrastructure developments applying an Eco-Engineering approach. Notional project scenarios will include e.g. the development of i) an offshore renewable energy test site, ii) an installation of an offshore wind farm, iii) ecological design for scour protection and revetments, iv) receptor-based instead of source-based limits approach to underwater sound. In each case three general levels of Eco-Engineering approaches will be considered:Considerate, responsible execution of offshore installation;Fundamental knowledge generation to inform about realistic environmental constrains;Develop innovative techniques to add ecological value to the design of offshore infrastructure.In addition to the normal study support resources, the course will have access to processes undertaken to develop the Falmouth Bay Test site (FaBTest), with embedded regulatory processes and customer requirements.",

The students will elaborate on an original piece of research on a topic in the wider area of electrical power engineering. They will then report on the work, its results and a critical appraisal of these in their dissertation.Research work begins at the start of the second semester, when the topic of research is allocated to the student.  Students and supervisors should meet in the second semester to discuss the research topic.  During this term the students are expected to complete a literature review and devise a plan to carry out the research.  They then submit the project Mission Statement by the end of the second semester in consultation with the supervisor.The main phase of the research work starts immediately after the May examinations. By mid-June, a project seminar will take place, during which students present their plans for their research and expected outcomes. By the first week of July, students will have arranged and taken a one-to-one interview with their project examiner.

The second component explores Power Electronics and Machines, where the students get to test in the lab the behaviour of motors and generators in different operational conditions. The courses contains a mixture of self-learning,  computer-based work using specialist software and practical work on electrical hardware.The first component explores Power Systems in weeks 1 to 5. It involves a group design exercise where students work in groups to design a power system based on specific criteria. The design will involve both a technical anaylsis and an economic analysis in order to appraise the feasibility of the proposed design. To assist with the exercise, the students are instructed to use a power flow simulation tool of the type that is widely used in industry. Students submit a group report which is assessed. Student performance within the group is assessed by their peers. Students will supported through 15 hours of supervised lab time.The second component explores Power Electronics and Machines in weeks 6 to 9. It involves building a lab-scale power generation system and testing it under a range of different conditions. Students will work in small groups of 2 or 3 and will spend up to 6 hours in a supervised electrical laboratory. Students submit an individual report which is assessed.Both components rely on students to self-learn the material necessary to complete the tasks.

A variety of different aspects of design are discussed (including: flammability, detection & alarm, smoke management, fire suppression, fire resistance, egress, etc.), with particular attention to systems of classification and design applications. The course distinguishes 'prescriptive' and 'performance-based' approaches to design, with an emphasis on understanding the philosophy of design guidance; references are made to more advanced methods and opportunities to use fire science knowledge and engineering analysis approaches, as well as the interface with structural engineering. The overall aim is to build confidence in tackling simple fire safety engineering design with due consideration to any limitations, uncertainties or conservatisms which may be present.",

    "course_description": "The course will equip students with tools to understand various approaches to oversight, assurance and stakeholder management in different organisations and cultures, and the critical insights required to understand their pros and cons in order to influence the selection of the most appropriate assurance regime. Students will be exposed to both practitioners and academics who have experienced and studied the dynamics and complex relationships between various parties involved (e.g. client, sponsors, programme management organisations, government representatives, auditors, external stakeholders, etc.).The course will be taught through a series of practical cases that highlight different approaches to oversight and assurance and stakeholder management, in a variety of industries across various cultures. It will be delivered in a 3-day intensive block of lectures and workshops with subsequent course work and examination. Key lecture topics:1. Approaches to oversight and assurance: a survey of techniques adopted for major programmes across different sectors, with critical insights into advantages and disadvantages2. The role of programme leaders in interacting and responding to findings from oversight and assurance, with case study examples from UK National Audit Office; US Department of Energy; UK Parliament Public Accounts Committee.3. Successful and less successful experiences in understanding and managing external stakeholders and lessons learned from practice.4. The role of programme leaders in ensuring that stakeholder management is effectively understood and embedded into project management behaviours, and tools for detecting early warnings and trends of emerging issues.Workshops will be used to explore in an interactive forum:- deeper dives into case studies with the support and involvement of senior practitioners with direct experience of oversight and assurance in major programmes- a scenario-based exercise to simulate issues and challenges of stakeholder management on a major programme and how to manage and mitigate the risks of successful outcomes.- how to prepare for a high profile public accountability interrogation on major programme performance.",

Different biosensor systems are explored, ranging from electrochemical devices, through to optical or thermal systems. Instruction is also given in the general principles of sampling and analysis, statistical presentation and manipulation of data acquired by biosensors.Finally this course examines the methods used to interface sensors for biological and biomedical applications with electronics. One focus will be on transducers, meaning devices which convert information from one form of energy to another. In this course the final form for the information will be an electrical signal but the transducers themselves could be optical, mechanical, etc., and operate in a number of different ways (eg., capacitive, potentiometric, photonic).This introductory course provides background that will be of particular use for the Semester 2 lab-on-chip technologies course.",

The dissertation is expected to engage critically and analytically with the literature in the field, building upon relevant concepts and theory covered in the taught element of the degree and deploying a range of primary and secondary sources as well as appropriate data-analytic and bibliographic skills.",
    "course_description": "The formal instruction and preparation for the Dissertation is provided within the Research Methods course which students will have taken and completed by the time they commence the Dissertation course.The Research Methods course requires students to identify a subject relevant to the aims of the LMP programme, that aligns with their own interests and ideally strategically contributes to their employment needs and experiences. Students will have framed their research subject and provided a research proposal that includes:- An encapsulation of their problem area that allows a problem identification and definition- A clear identification of the need for investigation- A research aim or aims together with accompanying research objectives- A clear identification of both the beneficiaries of their proposed work and what the benefit will potentially be- A brief understanding of the academic and industrial context of their proposed work- A broad but feasible programme or work for their investigation.This research proposal will then be used to commence and guide the students' research investigation, which is expected to last approximately 6 months under the supervision of a supervisor appropriate for their subject.The research methods course will also have provided the students with appropriate instruction in literature discovery, research philosophy and methodology, research methods, analysis tools and academic writing to enable them to effectively undertake their research and write it up.The report write up of their investigation, the dissertation itself, is subject to assessment by both supervisor and a 'second reader', together with an oral defence, or viva, scheduled between students and both assessors.Supervisors for the dissertation will be one of academic staff from either School of Engineering or the Business School. From time to time a supervisor from outside the university may be appointed who is either an academic or industrialist with experience and expert knowledge of the subject area.",

During the first week of the course, building on outputs from the EPSRC funded ORCA Hub (EP/R026173/1), we will discuss operations and maintenance (O&M), and the use of robotics and autonomous vehicles for inspection and maintenance tasks. Industrialists and consulting engineers will be invited to discuss how O&M has been optimised in recent projects. During the second week at the course will focus on digital twinning, machine learning, and sensor data obtained from equipment being operated in hostile environments. An remote experimental lab will give insight into remote operations and interpretation of real-sensor data, showing how autonomous systems can enable the safe, reliable, and cost-effective operation of a marine energy asset.",
    "course_description": "This course will begin with a broad overview of the impact that operations and maintenance scheduling has on the operational expenditure cost of an energy farm.There are then five modules: Operations and Maintenance; Robotics and Systems Engineering; Digital Twins and Cyber Physical Fabric; Machine Learning and Data Analysis; and Sensing for Asset Integrity Management.Each of these modules will consist of two lectures which will be delivered by academic sector experts.Specific topics to be covered are:Operations and Maintenance:Understanding the major facets of operations and maintenance, the relationships between asset owners, inspectors, and third party subcontractors. Understanding the challenging operating environment and the types of vessels and weather windows in which they can operate. Understanding O&M scheduling and certification.Robotics and Systems Engineering:Based upon the learning from the O&M module students will be able to appreciate the difficulty, and projected benefits, of deploying remotely operated vehicles and sensors, and understand the drivers for autonomous operations and resident robotic systems. The students will be introduced to currently available robotic systems and the software-stack used to operate them.Digital Twins and Cyber Physical Fabric:Students will be introduced to digital twinning both of assets and of robotic systems. They will understand the flow of data and appreciate the role of Cyber Physical Fabric in, for example, Asset Integrity Management.The first assessment in this course will be a video-report of the future potential for robotics and the cyber physical fabric in the offshore energy sector.Machine Learning and Data Analysis:The students will be introduced to machine learning as a tool for understanding and interpreting noisy real-world sensor data. They will be introduced to classifier models for time-series data, and they will understand the appropriate tools and methods used to interpret data.Sensing for Asset Integrity Management:The students will be introduced to the role of sensors and electronics for transducing information about an asset, e.g.: temperature, humidity, visual, and vibration. The challenges of data management and communications will be discussed.The second assessment in this course will be a laboratory exercise where students will access a remote-asset to collect representative time-series data, which they will then analyse using skills gained from the machine learning course. This will involve implementing classifier algorithms in python to interpret no-fault vs fault data.",

Drawing on case studies, the course will provide future leaders with the skills to understand the benefits of independent peer review, to manage the relationship with parties responsible for oversight and assurance of the programme, and to understand their role in the process of external assurance.Programmes will also have multiple stakeholder interests with varying degrees of influence over programme content and, even after programme scope is defined, over its execution and delivery. The course will explain the role of stakeholders in programme success and how best to manage those relationships.",
    "course_description": "The course will equip students with tools to understand various approaches to oversight, assurance and stakeholder management in different organisations and cultures, and the critical insights required to understand their pros and cons in order to influence the selection of the most appropriate assurance regime. Students will be exposed to both practitioners and academics who have experienced and studied the dynamics and complex relationships between various parties involved (e.g. client, sponsors, programme management organisations, government representatives, auditors, external stakeholders, etc.).The course will be taught through a series of practical cases that highlight different approaches to oversight and assurance and stakeholder management, in a variety of industries across various cultures. It will be delivered in a 3-day intensive block of lectures and workshops with subsequent course work and examination. Key lecture topics:1.\tApproaches to oversight and assurance: a survey of techniques adopted for major programmes across different sectors, with critical insights into advantages and disadvantages2.\tThe role of programme leaders in interacting and responding to findings from oversight and assurance, with case study examples from UK National Audit Office; US Department of Energy; UK Parliament Public Accounts Committee.3.\tSuccessful and less successful experiences in understanding and managing external stakeholders and lessons learned from practice.4.\tThe role of programme leaders in ensuring that stakeholder management is effectively understood and embedded into project management behaviours, and tools for detecting early warnings and trends of emerging issues.Workshops will be used to explore in an interactive forum:- deeper dives into case studies with the support and involvement of senior practitioners with direct experience of oversight and assurance in major programmes- a scenario-based exercise to simulate issues and challenges of stakeholder management on a major programme and how to manage and mitigate the risks of successful outcomes.- how to prepare for a high profile public accountability interrogation on major programme performance.",

    "summary": "This course is an integral, core part of the Leading Major Programmes MSc and will complement the other courses that focus on programme delivery. It starts with the concept that successful programmes require capable and effective leaders.What we think hugely influences what we do, and in turn, how we think influences what we think. These concepts of what and how we think are central to the subject of philosophy. The relevance to Engineering and to Major Programme Leaders is that they must 'think well' if they are to act well in their leadership; they should also create a climate of thinking in and around the programme. A deeper understanding of thought and thinking is beneficial to the goals of successful major programmes.",
    "course_description": "This course explores:- What are great outcomes (short & longer term, and from whose perspective)?- Who are the stakeholders and how might the programme leader engage them?- What types of thinking should be encouraged? What might a 'thought eco-system' look like? And what are the roles of diversity of thought, and seemingly contrary and negative thinking?- Are there 'wrong' ways of thinking? What do we think about embedded cultural norms, prejudice, cognitive bias and shallow reasoning?- How much should leaders seek certainty and set aside dilemmas, and how much uncertainty is it right to present to the world?- What ways of thinking, or 'thought tools', can we identify, that successful leaders have found useful?The course invites participants to learn from the history of thought and thinking, and to:- Learn what the body of knowledge is and what they can draw from it- Sample the intellectual space of those who have studied philosophy (as many politicians, strategists and commentators have)- See how different cultures may be appreciated by considering their different perspectives on shared subjects- Review and challenge some recent philosophical thinking in the area of the Philosophy of Engineering.Students will develop a personalised viewpoint on some key issues that will help them in their leadership of major programmes:- 'What is a major programme?' leads to what is needed to do 'major programmes better'The relationship of engineering and major programmes (engineering will be taken in the broadest sense, and the point made that the philosophy of engineering can be drawn from, even if the project is not 'an engineering project in the narrow sense'- Why 'what and how you think' determines 'how you act', to give a basis for leaders to challenge themselves and guide others- Certainty and uncertainty, and the risk of acting on the assumption of certainty when matters are uncertain, and conversely when certainty could be usefully assumed- What philosophy and philosophers can bring to major programmes, giving access to a new resource for leaders, within themselves, in the literature and from the wider communityCourse structureIn common with the wider MSc in Leading Major Programmes, the course will be delivered in a single semester, with six half-day engagements gathered in three one-day blocks.Each half-day will be structured as follows:- Pre-reading- Introducing an important philosophical tradition or concept- Quick overview of the ideas in the area, with a focus on one or two important philosophers- Relating this to some of the challenges of a programme leader (discussion)The three days will address topics:1. Knowledge, experience and reality2. Identity, values and the engineering profession3. Ethics and leadership in action.",

    "summary": "The Probability, Estimation Theory, and Random Signals course introduces the fundamental statistical tools that are required to analyse and describe advanced signal processing algorithms within   the   MSc   Signal   Processing   and   Communications programme.  It provides  a  unified  mathematical  framework which  is the  basis  for describing  random events  and  signals, and how to describe key characteristics  of random processes.The course covers  probability theory,  considers  the  notion of random variables  and vectors,  how they  can  be  manipulated, and  provides  an   introduction  to  estimation  theory.  It   is demonstrated  that  many  estimation  problems, and  therefore signal processing problems, can  be  reduced to  an exercise  in either optimisation or integration. While these problems can be solved  using  deterministic  numerical  methods,  the  course introduces the notion of Monte Carlo techniques which are the basis  of   powerful  stochastic   optimisation  and  integration algorithms.  These  methods  rely  on  being  able  to  sample numbers, or variates,  from arbitrary distributions. This course will  therefore   discuss   the   various  techniques   which   are necessary  to understand  these  methods and,  if time permits, techniques for random number generation are considered. The   random   signals   aspect    of   the   course   considers representing   real-world  signals   by   stochastic   or  random processes.   The   notion   of   statistical   quantities   such   as autocorrelation   and   auto-covariance   are   extended   from random  vectors  to  random  processes  (time  series),  and  a frequency-domain   analysis   framework   is   developed.   This course  also  investigates  the effect of  systems  and transformations on time-series, and how they  can be  used to help design powerful statistical  signal processing algorithms to achieve a particular task.The course introduces the notion of representing signals using parametric  models;  it  extends  the  broad  topic  of  statistical estimation  theory for determining optimal model parameters. In  particular, the  Bayesian  paradigm for statistical  parameter estimation is introduced. Emphasis is placed on relating these concepts to state-of-the-art  applications and signals. This course provides the fundamental  knowledge required for the advanced signal, image, and communication courses in the MSc course.",

    "summary": "The Probability, Random Variables and Estimation Theory course introduces the fundamental statistical tools that are required to analyse and describe advanced signal processing algorithms within the MSc Signal Processing and Communications programme. It provides a unified mathematical framework which is the basis for describing random events and signals, and how to describe key characteristics of random processes. The course covers probability theory, considers the notion of random variables and vectors, how they can be manipulated, and provides an introduction to estimation theory. It is demonstrated that many estimation problems, and therefore signal processing problems, can be reduced to an exercise in either optimisation or integration. While these problems can be solved using deterministic numerical methods, the course introduces Monte Carlo techniques which are the basis of powerful stochastic optimisation and integration algorithms. These methods rely on being able to sample numbers, or variates, from arbitrary distributions. This course will therefore discuss the various techniques which are necessary to understand these methods and, if time permits, techniques for random number generation are considered.This course, in combination with the Statistical Signal Processing course, provides the fundamental knowledge required for the advanced signal, image, and communication modules in the MSc course.",

    "summary": "Contracts and the transaction processes to award them are fundamental in setting the conditions for programmes' success.  The course will provide an overview of different forms of contracts and approaches to transaction (e.g. relational contracting) and is generally structured around the UK Infrastructure and Projects Authority's '6 Pillars of Procurement'.",
    "course_description": "The course considers, from a fundamental perspective, the issue of how clients can realise their required benefits through programme delivery. It will equip students with tools to understand various appetites for risk in different organisations and cultures, ways of setting key stakeholders benefits, users' requirements, the status of supply markets, how to create the interfaces to optimal delivery through effective packaging, how to set incentive structures at various levels and along the supply chain in order to manage the dynamics and complex relationships between various parties involved (e.g. client, sponsors, programme management organisations, government representatives, supplier shareholders etc.).The course will be taught through a series of practical cases that highlight different approaches to packaging, contracting and transacting in supply markets, in a variety of industries across various cultures.The course will be delivered using the Infrastructure and Projects Authority '6 Pillars of Procurement'. These six pillars were developed by Martin Rowark from the delivery of the London 2012 and later the Crossrail programme and cover the following specific areas:Pillar 1 - Understand and Communicate Requirements (Requires the client to be able to communicate with clarity and precision a detailed suit of expected outcomes, breaking it down into the key output requirements for each contract and undertaking.)Pillar 2 - The MarketsSupply Chain Management provides the ability for a client to fully appreciate the Marketplaces within which it operates and the leverage it has in each.Pillar 3 - Packaging the ProgrammePackaging of a project, programme or undertaking in an optimal way is one of the most critical parts of the procurement process; to create the most effective interfaces with and between suppliers allows a client to manage the risks they are best placed to manage.Pillar 4 - ContractingRequires the client to give careful consideration of what risks it wishes to transfer and allocate to the supply chain, each of the generic contracting models from outcomes to inputs (price to cost) should be considered.Pillar 5 - Routes to MarketThe route to market is the last stage of the procurement process before contract award; often referred to as the transaction stage it is characterised by the methodology of down-selection.Pillar 6 - Benefits CommunicationThe Benefits Communication Pillar exists as it is recognised that a key obligation when procuring is to demonstrate outcomes, outputs and lessons learnt.Lecture topics (with key case study source material)1.\tThe '6 Pillars of Procurement' (IPA Project Initiation Route map). This topic introduces the IPA '6 pillars procurement' and explains how aspects of the approach have been used on major programmes as a method for comparing and contrasting delivery, procurement and commercial models.2.\tThe quest for Collaboration (Lathan, Egan the NEC to Project, Partnering to Project 13). This topic covers the inception of the collaborative ethos and culture and how the drive for efficiency and effectiveness through the concepts of mutuality, trust and cooperation have affected procurement and commercial delivery models.3.\tSupply Chain Analytics and Economics (London 2012, Crossrail and Thameslink).  The third topic explains how clients on major programmes have evolved their approach to the primary delivery resource: the supply chain. It also looks at client structures, supply chain economic monitoring and economic benefits during programme delivery.4.\tPrice to Cost based contracting (Metronet PPP to Magnox PBO to @OneAlliance).  This topic focusses on the range of packaging and contracting solutions available to clients delivering major programmes. Using the '6 Pillars' it compares and contrasts solutions and attributes, advantages and challenges of each, with a particular focus on the understanding of risk and its allocation within programme delivery.",

This is done through a consideration of the process of research and a detailed overview of the methods which are appropriate to the students in the programme. The course will also consider practical aspects of research dissemination using visual (poster) and written documents.",
    "course_description": "Course topics include:Problem identification and framing- Research is presented as a transformative process, moving the doer and the user of research from a position of need to knowledge. The nature of this 'need' or demand is understood, allowing the student to appreciate their research domain in terms of who the beneficiaries are, why the research is needed and what difference it will make. This allows research to be 'framed' and generates candidates for the aims and research questions for investigation.Literature and industry context- Before a plan for research is finalised, and before the research intentions are understood, the specific context of both scholarly theory and industry practice need to be appreciated. Traditionally this is known as the 'Literature Review', though we will explore the use of that term and appreciate its fuller purpose. Sessions here will consider the process of literature discovery and identifying gaps in the knowledge of the problem domain. This part of the course will also focus on the reviewing of literature and critical writing.Academic publishing and dissemination- In combination with the previous topic of understanding the problem domain context, this part of the course will provide additional value through a review of the academic publishing process, from writing, to peer-review, open-access, impact and contribution. This part of the course will allow a broader and more nuanced understanding of the purpose of academic and research, allowing students to place their own work, its needs and contributions in a wider and more holistic context. It will also introduce the concept of research ethics, from both the view point of protecting the research subject and also of integrity in research practice.Research philosophy and methodology- The possible approaches to research are extremely broad and choices are made dependent on the problem itself and what is hoped to be achieved. This session will first explore the pluralism in research, understanding that there are 'natural science' and 'social science' paradigms. It will consider the issues of how we know, or epistemology, together with more philosophical issues such as how we know what exists or ontology. Students will understand how these concepts affect how they might approach their investigations and lead to questions over interpretivist or positivist frameworks.Research methods- As a direct follow-on from methodology students will then understand the more pragmatic aspects of how research is to be done. Methods will be presented from deductive or inductive and exploratory or explanatory viewpoints. The concepts of qualitative or quantitative study are explored and understanding of common research methods, particularly for quantitative work, will be provided.Analysis tools- Some common tools associated with qualitative and quantitative research are presented. Students will understand that the tools chosen will match the research paradigms previously set. Instruction in the use of statistical tools and thematic analysis in particular will be provided.Interpretation, making sense, conclusion and contribution- The whole purpose of research is explored again which results in the understanding that research has no value if its outcomes are not explored and its contribution not captured. This process is referred to as 'making-sense' and is as important in qualitative as quantitative work. The interpretation and making sense phase of research leads to concepts such as discussion and conclusion in academic writing; or executive summary and recommendations in technical writing.Academic dissemination- Finally the course will provide guidance and instruction in the process of academic writing and the production of a final thesis or dissertation.- Other forms of dissemination will also be covered, including conference poster and presentationThe course is assessed by the preparation of a Research Proposal that includes:- An encapsulation of their problem area that allows a problem identification and definition- A clear identification of the need for investigation- A research aim or aims together with accompanying research objectives- A clear identification of both the beneficiaries of their proposed work and what the benefit will potentially be- An understanding of the academic and industrial context of their proposed work- A broad but feasible programme or work for their investigation.This research proposal will then be used to commence and guide the students' research investigation as part of their Dissertation course, which is expected to last approximately 6 months under the supervision of a supervisor appropriate for their subject.",

Sessions here will consider the process of literature discovery and identifying gaps in the knowledge of the problem domain. This part of the course will also focus on the reviewing of literature and critical writing.Academic publishing and dissemination- In combination with the previous topic of understanding the problem domain context, this part of the course will provide additional value through a review of the academic publishing process, from writing, to peer-review, open-access, impact and contribution. This part of the course will allow a broader and more nuanced understanding of the purpose of academic and research, allowing students to place their own work, its needs and contributions in a wider and more holistic context. It will also introduce the concept of research ethics, from both the view point of protecting the research subject and also of integrity in research practice.Research philosophy and methodology- The possible approaches to research are extremely broad and choices are made dependent on the problem itself and what is hoped to be achieved. This session will first explore the pluralism in research, understanding that there are 'natural science' and 'social science' paradigms. It will consider the issues of how we know, or epistemology, together with more philosophical issues such as how we know what exists or ontology. Students will understand how these concepts affect how they might approach their investigations and lead to questions over interpretivist or positivist frameworks.Research methods- As a direct follow-on from methodology students will then understand the more pragmatic aspects of how research is to be done. Methods will be presented from deductive or inductive and exploratory or explanatory viewpoints. The concepts of qualitative or quantitative study are explored and understanding of common research methods, particularly for quantitative work, will be provided.Analysis tools- Some common tools associated with qualitative and quantitative research are presented. Students will understand that the tools chosen will match the research paradigms previously set. Instruction in the use of statistical tools and thematic analysis in particular will be provided.Interpretation, making sense, conclusion and contribution- The whole purpose of research is explored again which results in the understanding that research has no value if its outcomes are not explored and its contribution not captured. This process is referred to as 'making-sense' and is as important in qualitative as quantitative work. The interpretation and making sense phase of research leads to concepts such as discussion and conclusion in academic writing; or executive summary and recommendations in technical writing.Academic dissemination- Finally the course will provide guidance and instruction in the process of academic writing and the production of a final thesis or dissertation.- Other forms of dissemination will also be covered, including conference poster and presentationThe course will be assessed by the preparation of a Literature Review that includes:- An encapsulation of a relevant problem area or 'research domain' that allows a problem identification and definition- A clear identification of both the beneficiaries of their proposed work and what the benefit will potentially be- An understanding of the academic and industrial context of their proposed work",

    "summary": "One half of this course covers adsorption and crystallization processes. The section on adsorption processes is aimed to understand how to design and operate a cyclic adsorption process and estimate its performance. To this end, we apply a mathematical method called Equilibrium Theory to various adsorption systems and learn a graphical method to construct a cyclic adsorption process cycle. The crystallisation process section comprises solid/liquid phase equilibrium, mass and energy balances and the analysis of a crystalliser (MSMPR).The other half of the course, on distillation, comprises a discussion of composition and temperature profiles in ideal distillation columns, followed by examples and purposes of non-standard configurations and energy integration schemes for distillation. The modelling basis for tray-by-tray simulation of distillation columns is followed by a review of how azeotrope - forming mixtures can be separated. Topics include the causes of non-ideality, extractive and azeotropic distillation and composition trajectories.",

It recognises that the world is a set of highly interconnected technical and social entities which are hierarchically organised, producing emergent behaviour. The idea of a system as 'a set of parts which, when combined, have qualities that are not present in any of the parts themselves' is a very productive way of looking at the world - which turns out to be full of systems. Large engineering endeavours are nearly always complex systems which include, for example, people, processes, information, organisations and services, as well as software, hardware and complex products. In order to understand and manage these activities it is essential that a systems approach is taken to ensure that all aspects are understood, and their interactions are optimised to ensure successful delivery.A characteristic of complex systems is that of 'emergence'. Emergent behaviour arises when system elements interact with each other and their environment, and indeed only exist when the components of a system are able to interact. Emergence brings with it the risk of unintended consequences - a major cause of embarrassing system and project failures - but it is also possible for skilled systems engineers to create higher value for less cost by using emergence to deliver desired system qualities.

Finally it briefly examines how renewables can be integrated effectively within the energy system.The course provides sufficient depth and coverage to build a comprehensive understanding of renewable energy whilst acting as an introduction to more specialist courses on individual technology areas (e.g. wind energy). It also introduces engineering design processes and methodologies, through an exploration of the varied practices of designing sustainable energy installations across a range of technologies. The course material requires numeracy and knowledge of basic physics concepts.The course deals mainly with renewable electricity generation and its role but includes some material on renewable heat; nuclear and conventional power is excluded.The course is based on lectures and reading material that provide an efficient summary of key material and techniques, supported by interactive Seminars and Examples Classes. These are further supplemented by tutorial questions and text books. The course is challenging and requires hard work.",

This course introduces students to the fundamental theory of the finite element method as a general tool for numerically solving differential equations for a wide range of engineering problems. Field problems described by the Laplace, and Poisson equations are presented first and all steps of the FE formulation are described. Specific applications in heat transfer are demonstrated. The application of the method to elasticity problems is then developed from fundamental principles. Specific classes of problems are then discussed based on abstractions and idealisations of 3D solids, such as plane stress and strain, Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beams and Kirchoff and Mindlin-Reissner plates and shells. Special topics such as multiple constraints and substructuring are introduced.",

We will cover differentiation of these fields as well as line, double, triple and surface integration focusing on work and flux integrals. For the second theme we also have a total of 10 lectures, where 2D integration of scalar fields is fundamental, we will introduce the concepts of random events and variables, as well as the axioms of probability, with emphasis on joint and conditional probabilities, independence, Bayes theorem, and the central limit theorem. In the second half of theme 2, we switch from probability to statistics to learn about point estimators from data, their bias and variance, and then interval estimators and how to conduct hypothesis tests using data samples, before we close with an introduction in linear regression and the least squares method which is ubiquitous in engineering analysis.The course has 1 handwritten coursework assessments with 10% of the credit each, one on each theme, and a final exam on both themes for the remaining 80% of the credit. Each coursework is scheduled for a 10 hour load including preparation reading.

The course shows how Equations of State calibrated on equilibrium data can lead to the identification of Thermodynamic Functions (Internal Energy, Enthalpy, Entropy, Gibbs Energy, Helmholtz Energy and Chemical Potential) and how these can be can be practically retrieved by using also other measurable thermodynamic quantities (specific heat capacity, expansivity and isothermal compressibility). This is delivered in the context of pure fluids and used to describe the performance of single reversible transformations, power generation and refrigeration cycles.",

It has been designed as an interdisciplinary cross college course offered to 2nd year engineering, chemistry, health and social science students and biomedical sciences undergraduates.The course has been designed as part of the wider and successful EPSRC 'Our Health' Interdisciplinary Research Programme.Students will form interdisciplinary research teams and work together to investigate research questions around health and wellbeing that have been posed by 'Our Health' patient and local community partners.The course offers students the opportunity to benefit from enriched experiential interdisciplinary learning as they apply their own academic rigour to the research question while simultaneously acquiring an interactive expertise of other disciplines throughout the research process. Students develop new skills and graduate attributes such as research management and planning, teamwork, negotiation, critical thinking and perspective taking through their community engagement. They gain a clear sense of their own ethical and social responsibility as they engage with these real-world problems around health and wellbeing that respond directly to the UNs SDGs.Each team of students are introduced to a mentor who is associated with the Our Health Programme and will guide the student teams in each phase of their project work, via weekly meetings. The student mentor will also introduce the student teams to their community partners who will describe the research question and initiate the research project.If the quota has been reached and you are interested in joining this course, please contact the Course Secretary.",
    "course_description": "The course comprises of two phasesPhase 1 - the student teams meet project mentors and community partners and begin an induction to research planning, management, as well as concepts of interdisciplinary research, community-based research, ethical protocols and research innovation. Expertise in these areas will drawn from across the EPSRC Our Health programme (and associated interdisciplinary research project EPSRC Proteus/EPSRC InLightenUS). Community partners will introduce the student teams to the real-world research question. They will then work together with community partners to understand its social, scientific and commercial implications and applications. Students will present their findings and be assessed on those presentations.Phase 2 - Students will develop a research plan for their research question, including context and clinical need, methodologies, experimental design and justifications. At the end of phase 2 students will present their research plans and will be assessed on content and communication skills.Throughout Phase 1 and 2 students will submit a series of structured reflective journals that are designed to encourage them to reflect upon the knowledge and skills they are actively developing throughout their research project. These journals will be assessed on students' critical reflection.",

This course is structured on the Student Led Individually Created Courses (SLICC) University wide framework. This framework enables students to design their own experiential learning through the work they undertake as a part of the SIG or independently. The student would provide evidence of their reflective learning through e\u0002portfolio which would consist of but not limited to conceptual design, detailed design, manufacturing drawings, computations etc which would be used as evidence to demonstrate the achievement of the course learning outcomes. This SCQF Level 8 course requires students to demonstrate the design and execution of their chosen experience, identifying the range of skills and abilities needed for the experience, a specific skill and mindset to be developed through the experience and evaluating and reflecting on their approach, learning and development aligning it with their career aspirations.",

All proposals require approval by the course organiser.The steps in undertaking the course are as follows:1. Identify a suitable opportunity within one of the SIG or personal engineering project to undertake learning experience.2. Complete a draft proposal and submit the document through prescribed link for the feedback and approval by the course organiser. There may be a need for a few iterations to finalise the project proposal.3. Once the proposal is approved, prepare and manage the learning experience.4. Actively reflect the progress and document the experience in the form of reflective blogs, conceptual and detailed engineering drawings, simulations or any appropriate outputsand use those as evidence in completing the 'Interim Reflective Report' and 'Final Reflective Report'.5. Complete formative self-assessment and submit for summative assessment.The focus of the course in on learning from experience and therefore what did not work is equally important to what has worked. The steps identified above must be carefully executed centering on learning from the experience outlined in the proposal. The reflective documentation and other relevant documents will form a part of e\u0002portfolio of evidence which will be used as a part of the assessment of the course. The evidence is vital when demonstrating how the learning outcomes of the course have met.This course is available to the students who- are registered on Y2 of one of the UG programmes offered by the School of Engineering.- Are able to demonstrate experience of sustained engineering project broadly in a Design-Build-Test-Learn framework, normally achieved by working as a part of a studentinnovation group or an equivalent endeavour.While majority of the work will be carried out independently, the course would consist of the compulsory sessions:1. Lecture: On the overview and conduct of the course, building e-portfolio and building reflective learning.2. Feedback on reflective framework: The students will receive formative feedback from their tutors at least once a month during the semester on their reflective writing.3. Feedback on technical aspects: Students part of SIGs will receive feedback on the technical aspects of their design as part of technical design reviews conducted during thesemester (at least one per semester). Students undertaking independent project will receive feedback from their tutors.",

    "summary": "Systems Thinking is a way of thinking used to address complex and uncertain real world problems. It recognises that the world is a set of highly interconnected technical and social entities which are hierarchically organised, producing emergent behaviour. The idea of a system as 'a set of parts which, when combined, have qualities that are not present in any of the parts themselves' is a very productive way of looking at the world - which turns out to be full of systems. Large engineering endeavours are nearly always complex systems which include, for example, people, processes, information, organisations and services, as well as software, hardware and complex products. In order to understand and manage these activities it is essential that a systems approach is taken to ensure that all aspects are understood, and their interactions are optimised to ensure successful delivery. A characteristic of complex systems is that of 'emergence'. Emergent behaviour arises when system elements interact with each other and their environment, and indeed only exist when the components of a system are able to interact. Emergence brings with it the risk of unintended consequences - a major cause of embarrassing system and project failures - but it is also possible for skilled systems engineers to create higher value for less cost by using emergence to deliver desired system qualities.The course will build on this Systems Thinking to show how the techniques of Systems Engineering can be used, and where the limitations of traditional methods become apparent and new data-driven approaches are needed.",
    "course_description": "The course is made of two modules, covering each of two main subjects: Systems Thinking and Systems Practice.The questions and topics that these two models will cover:1. Systems Thinking:- What is a system? Systems Thinking?- Complex and Complicated systems: what is the difference and how should each be approached?- Emergent Behaviour of Complex Systems and Unintended Consequences- Mission-oriented project design in human-centered organisations- Core dimensions of Environmental and Social Governance in/of Complex Systems2. Systems Practice:- Why big projects go wrong? How systems engineering can help?- The tools of systems engineering- Is the classical systems engineering model relevant in today's digital environment?- The diversity of socio-technical systems and stakeholders involved- Use of futures design for strategic system alignment and expectation managementSummative assessment for this course will be conducted through two types of coursework;- Team; Students work in teams to analyse an existing case study and evaluate the options to apply systems engineering techniques.- Individual; The students carry out systems partitioning exercise and carry out risk analysis for two systems management options.",
