    "summary": "This course intends to illustrate the usefulness of economic analysis in a global context. The course is divided into 3 main themes: development economics, inequality and trade. The first part of the course studies how international trade generates gains and inequalities. The second part of the course focuses on developing countries and relevant principles of economic development.",
    "course_description": "This course is designed to provide an understanding of the key determinants of economic development, inequality and trade. The course combines economic theories with empirical studies. It is divided into two halves. In the first half, we study how the economic development of different regions is interconnected through trade. We begin by examining the patterns of international trade. We then define and use the principle of comparative advantage. We formalise the reasons why countries trade using classical theories and general equilibrium models of trade. These models highlight that trade can generate both gains and inequalities. In the second half, we begin by defining economic development and measuring the gap between poor and rich countries. We will define and make use of concepts like poverty, inequality and economic growth. We then review the classic theories of economic growth, which attempt to explain why some countries are rich and others are poor and contrast those with the contemporary models of development. We will also consider the role of political institutions and human capital in generating economic development.",

    "course_description": "This is an economics course on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Increasingly, social, environmental and ethical considerations are salient when discussing firm behaviour in capitalist and market economies. We will address its implications, from a positive as well as from a normative point of view. Thus, after showing that citizens show pro-social preferences in their market behaviour (e.g., as consumers or shareholders), we will study its effect on product market competition. When doing so, we will consider a crucial aspect with regards to the so called socially responsible firm practices, namely, the level of market transparency. CSR not only concerns consumers, but also other firm stakeholders such as employees, suppliers, shareholders and other financiers, and we will also pay attention to them in our analysis.Then, we will discuss corporate governance in light of corporate social responsibility, as well as the interaction that CSR (sometimes also called self-regulation) has with the more traditional way society usually has dealt with firm behaviour, namely, formal regulation. Then, we will also study and discuss some industry and firm case studies, including the role of CSR in the current climate change crisis. Finally, we end with an analysis of the moral limits of the markets, discussing whether it is appropriate for certain transactions (such as kidneys exchanges) to be part of the market exchange or not.Unlike other courses on corporate social responsibility and business ethics that are taught in educational programs for business management, the objective of this course is not to provide students with management tools; rather, it aims to contribute to an analysis and discussion, primarily from economics, to the issues addressed.

    "summary": "This course aims to bring students closer to answering an important question: what should humanity's priorities be? Every year, governments, foundations, and individuals spend hundreds of billions of dollars to improve the world. But even this kind of money isn't enough to solve all of the world's problems, so we must prioritise. Doing this well is critically important: it is plausible that better prioritisation could save tens or hundreds of thousands of lives per year, could help lower extinction risk by between 1% and 10%, could raise global economic output by more than 10%, or could otherwise considerably improve our condition.",
    "course_description": "This introductory course is intended to give students context about the current state of knowledge about the world's biggest problems and how they might be solved. It has no prerequisites and assumes no prior knowledge beyond what all students will have learned in secondary school.Specific topics covered will include: global health (including mortality from easily preventable causes), extinction risk (including both natural risks such as asteroid impacts but also anthropogenic risks such as engineered pandemics or malignant artificial intelligence), economic development, population ethics, and more.There will be facts to learn in this course, but they are important facts which you'll be glad to know, and there will be resources to support your learning.Global priorities research is inherently interdisciplinary, using techniques from economics, philosophy, maths, and from other social sciences. This course is (mostly) taught by economists, so there will be an economic emphasis, but no prior economics exposure is assumed or required.",

This is the language of mathematics, and is widely used by economists.  This is important for making precise hypotheses, such as \"in every equilibrium, real wages increase over time\", and for verifying these hypotheses with logically sound proofs.  The main concepts are: sets, functions, logical connectives, quantifiers, countability, induction, proof by contradiction.* Real Analysis and Metric Spaces.  This branch of mathematics focuses on continuity and nearness (topology) while putting geometric concepts like distance and angles into the background.  These ideas are useful for determining whether an optimal decision is possible, whether an equilibrium of an economy exists, and determining when optimal decisions change drastically when circumstances change.  The main concepts are: open sets, continuity, limits, interior, boundary, closure, function spaces, sup metric, Cauchy sequences, connected spaces, complete spaces, compact spaces, Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, Banach fixed point theorem, Brouwer fixed point theorem.* Convex Analysis.  This branch of geometry focuses on comparing extreme points and intermediate points that lie between extremes.  These tools are useful for determining whether there is one or several optimal decisions in a particular situation, and determining in which direction optimal choices move when circumstances change.  Convex analysis is related to the economic notions of increasing marginal cost and decreasing marginal benefit. The main concepts are: convex sets, convex and concave functions, quasi-convex and quasi-concave functions, supporting hyperplane theorem, separating hyperplane theorem.* Dynamic Programming.  This branch of mathematics is about breaking up a complicated optimisation problem involving many decisions into many simpleoptimisation problems involving few decisions.  For example, a lifetime of choices can be broken up into simple choices made day-by-day.  The mainconcepts are: value functions, Bellman equations, Bellman operators.* Envelope Theorem.

    "summary": "This course studies the behaviour of firms and organisations by looking at their internal structure and the interactions among workers (e.g. the importance of social interactions between co-workers, the role of communication, etc.) and between different layers of the organisation, (e.g. the importance of managers and CEOs, the effect of good/bad management practices, etc.). The course also explores the main theories and reasons that explain that firms exists, the mechanisms that determine productivity and outcomes (e.g. the how incentives and imperfect information determine the performance of workers, the role of intrinsic motivation, etc.). The focus of the course is not only (private) firms but also organisations of different types, like NGOs, police forces or other government institutions.The course has a strong empirical component but it also leverages some models that rationalize and explain the observed behaviour of the individuals that compose the organisation.  The combination of empirical evidence with theoretical models allows us to design policies that can improve the outcomes of the organisation by optimally aligning the incentives within itFinally, it studies how the design of the structure of the organisation can lead to different performance (e.g. family firms, horizontal/decentralised vs. vertical firms, team vs. individual production, etc.).The focus of the course is not only (private) firms but also organisations of different types, like NGOs, police forces or other government institutions.The course has a strong empirical component but also leverage some models that rationalize and explain the observed behaviour of the individuals that compose the organisation.

    "course_description": "The course starts by reviewing the different theories that explain the existence of firms/organisations. Given the strong empirical content of the course, we review the main econometric tools required to understand the applications and readings (Regression analysis, RCTs, Panel Methods, Difference-in-Differences, IV and Regression Discontinuity). Then, the course study a number of topics and applications that include: the role of managers and management practices, communication, social interactions and peer effects within firms, the role of incentives and imperfect information, intrinsic motivation, the hierarchical structure of the firm (horizontal vs. vertical firms, family firms), team vs. individual production. The course is taught through a series of lectures, problem sets and readings of empirical papers. The assessment of the course includes a group coursework, a group presentation and a written final exam.",

If it is necessary to alter the course content (to accommodate changes in staffing) then the School will let all enrolled students know as soon as we can.The course is taught through a programme of lectures. The course involves an assessed project, in which students are required to collaborate in groups and undertake their own modelling, estimation, evaluation and reporting, developing skills frequently expected of contemporary economics graduates in a wide variety of contexts.",

Game theory now pervades most non-elementary models in microeconomic theory and many models in other branches of economics and social sciences. We introduce the necessary analytical tools to understand these models and illustrate them with examples and some economic applications. We also aim to develop an abstract analysis of strategic thinking and foster a critical and open-minded attitude toward game-theoretic concepts.Most of the course content relies on mathematical and formal reasoning. At a minimum, students should be familiar with mathematical notation regarding sets and functions, elementary linear algebra and calculus, and basic proof techniques (e.g., mathematical induction). A basic understanding of more advanced topics in linear algebra, calculus, and topology in Euclidean spaces will be useful.",

We are offering two courses on this topic because it is a popular subject and we will have capacity constraints next year. Students cannot take both courses.Although ECNM10119 and ECNM10082 share a considerable amount of Health Economics topics, they differ in some areas of focus and the depth with which they explore specific topics. ECNM10082 emphasizes the demand side of health and the health care market, and dedicates a substantial portion of the course to the methods for the evaluation of health policies and interventions. ECNM10119 balances the demand and supply side of the health care market and gives emphasis to health insurance markets as well as the complexities of different health care systems.",
    "course_description": "The module aims to provide students with an introduction to the key concepts, methods and understanding of the application of economics to health and health care.  Students will gain knowledge of the core theories underpinning health economics, but more importantly, it aims to stimulate students critical thinking about the major challenges health care systems face and how health economics can play a role in understanding and mitigating those challenges. The module incorporates a combination of the core theory underpinning health economics and empirical research within health economics.The module begins by introducing health economics and the economics of health, their importance and some of their unique characteristics. It will introduce students to the theory of demand for health care including the Grossman model and its empirical applications, as well as individual health behaviour and the role of behavioural economics in health. Following this, it considers the supply and financing of health care and then explores inequalities in both the distribution and financing of health care, drawing on empirical analyses. The latter part of the module focuses on economic evaluation (EE) and decision-making relating to resource prioritisation within health care. It covers the methods involved in EE and explores its application in mental health and the role it plays in decision making in practice.",

Since the number of students taking the course is strictly limited you should decide whether to take the course or not quickly so as to give those on the waiting list a chance to replace any drop-outs.The course will be taught via a combination of lecture classes and tutorials. There will be 12 classes, covering the topics listed above plus 10 weekly tutorials in groups of approximately 6 students. The lectures are intended to supplement the textbooks and other assigned readings. Students are expected to read the assigned readings for each lecture before watching/listening to the lectures.Please note: Due to unavoidable constraints, the in-person teaching for this course will take place at the University's King's Buildings campus, rather than at the Central area.",

It uses a combination of game theoretic and empirical methods from previously studied economics courses and beyond to explore the incentives of the major political actors (voters and politicians, as well as special interest groups, bureaucrats, media), factors that affect their behaviour, and how their behaviours shape the policy making and institutions. The topics may include (but are not limited to) voting, electoral competition, lobbying, role of media, conflict.",

The first seven lectures span theoretical models in political economy together with discussing them in the context of empirical evidence. The topics include Social choice, Electoral competition under prospective voting, Retrospective voting and political accountability, Lobbying and Media. In the last three lectures we will explore a range of empirical studies that shed light on the interactions between political actors and outcomes. Potential topics include the influence of lobbying on policy decisions and the granting of policy favours, the role of media in shaping public opinion and electoral behaviour, and the impact of conflict on voting behaviour (i.e. will try to match a more theoretical part of the course). These discussions will provide a deeper understanding of how various factors contribute to political and economic outcomes in different contexts.",

We will study the role of factor accumulation, technological change and innovation in explaining patterns of productivity, growth in economic activity and comparative development in the modern era. We will look at aggregate and firm level evidence on the productivity and economic growth. We will also explore the impact of technology diffusion on growth and cross-country income differences in the growth process. Another theme we will consider is the role of institutions in growth and historical development. We will examine growth over the longer run and examine the characteristics of different growth epochs, transitions between different epochs and unified growth models that seek to explain them. A final theme is the relationship between technological progress, the labour market and inequality. The aim is to introduce you to the research literature on these topics, and to enable you to understand the strong interplay between theory and empirical evidence.",

    "summary": "This course aims to provide a selective but in-depth review of the academic literature on China's economic development, in both historical and contemporary context. It is targeted at students with some knowledge of economic theory and econometrics at the undergraduate level. Some key topics will include the Great Divergence of Europe and China during the nineteenth century, the institutional underpinnings of China's recent growth miracle, as well as the implications of this growth for today's global economy.",
    "course_description": "The first part of the course will be an economic history of China pre-1949. Here we will take a comparative approach to classic questions such as why China did not become the world's first industrialised economy (the so-called Needham Puzzle). This will be followed by a brief examination of China's planned economy during 1949-1978, including the Great Famine and the Cultural Revolution. The second part of the course will try to explain China's recent growth miracle, focusing on key institutions such as dual-track liberalisation, fiscal decentralisation and bureaucratic incentives. Finally, we conclude by studying the implications of this growth for the global economy, primarily through the channel of greater trade integration.",

The course aims to show how the health care system differs from the economic textbook model of perfectly competitive markets. It will offer an overview of the issues of demand and supply for health care, supplier-induced demand, equity and inequality, health care financing and health insurance. It will emphasize the use of economic evaluation for assessing health care interventions as a way of making informed decisions in terms of costs and benefits. In addition, a range of practical examples will be provided of how health economics is applied in practice in both resource rich and resource poor countries.Note that this course is very similar to ECNM10082, Health Economics, which will run in Semester 2. We are offering two courses on this topic because it is a popular subject and we will have capacity constraints next year. Students cannot take both courses.Although ECNM10119 and ECNM10082 share a considerable amount of Health Economics topics, they differ in some areas of focus and the depth with which they explore specific topics. ECNM10082 emphasizes the demand side of health and the health care market, and dedicates a substantial portion of the course to the methods for the evaluation of health policies and interventions. ECNM10119 balances the demand and supply side of the health care market and gives emphasis to health insurance markets as well as the complexities of different health care systems.",

The aim is to provide students with the tools to understand the economic forces that determine sorting patterns, as well as the influence the sorting process wields on the distribution of income in the economy.As an example, observe the following facts about the labour market: workers differ greatly in their skills and preferences; jobs differ in the types of skills they require, the extent to which the worker's skills matter, and the amenities they offer.Which workers will then perform which jobs in a market equilibrium? How much of a paycut would a worker need take to land their dream job?  How much of a premium would a firm need to offer in order to hire the most skilled worker? These are the types of questions we will attempt to answer in this course.The course will cover five topics. Each topic will be divided into two parts: theory and applications. The theory part will develop and solve a particular sorting model, while the applications part will apply said model to specific markets. The following topics may be covered (subject to change):1. The one-dimensional model of sorting. Applications: sorting and CEO compensation, marriage market (1), distributional consequences of international migration.2. Roy's model of self-selection/occupational sorting. Applications: selection into migration, technological change and the distribution of wages (1).3. Multi-dimensional sorting. Application: technological change and the distribution of wages (2).4. Sorting with non-transferable utility. Applications: school choice, marriage market (2).5.

    "summary": "In this course we will explore the economics of frictional labour markets, and their implications for unemployment, imperfect labour market competition, wage inequality, and labour market dynamics. From a theoretical perspective, we will cover two canonical approaches to labour market frictions: models of wage posting, and models of search and matching. These will involve some introductory dynamic economic theory that is somewhat advanced for the undergraduate level. For this reason, the course is likely to be particularly useful to students who intend to pursue postgraduate work in economics. We will also apply these models to relevant empirical analoguesÂ¿for example, the behaviour of labour market flows, the Beveridge curve, and so on.The course is taught through a programme of lectures and tutorials. Learning-by-doing, through problem solving and discussion of exercise sets, is an important ingredient of the course.",

    "course_description": "The topics covered vary from year to year.An example curriculum would be the following mathematics concepts illustrated inthe context of general equilibrium theory:* Naive Set Theory. This is the language of mathematics, and is widelyused by economists. This is important for making precise hypotheses, such as\"in every equilibrium, real wages increase over time\", and for verifying thesehypotheses with logically sound proofs. The main concepts are: sets,functions, logical connectives, quantifiers, countability, induction, proof bycontradiction.* Real Analysis and Metric Spaces. This branch of mathematics focuses oncontinuity and nearness (topology) while putting geometric concepts likedistance and angles into the background. These ideas are useful for determiningwhether an optimal decision is possible, whether an equilibrium of an economyexists, and determining when optimal decisions change drastically whencircumstances change. The main concepts are: open sets, continuity, limits,interior, boundary, closure, function spaces, sup metric, Cauchy sequences,connected spaces, complete spaces, compact spaces, Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem,Banach fixed point theorem, Brouwer fixed point theorem.* Convex Analysis. This branch of geometry focuses on comparing extremepoints and intermediate points that lie between extremes. These tools areuseful for determining whether there is one or several optimal decisionsin a particular situation, and determining in which direction optimal choicesmove when circumstances change. Convex analysis is related to the economicnotions of increasing marginal cost and decreasing marginal benefit.The main concepts are: convex sets, convex and concave functions,quasi-convex and quasi-concave functions, supporting hyperplane theorem,separating hyperplane theorem.* Dynamic Programming. This branch of mathematics is about breaking upa complicated optimisation problem involving many decisions into many simpleoptimisation problems involving few decisions. For example, a lifetime ofchoices can be broken up into simple choices made day-by-day. The mainconcepts are: value functions, Bellman equations, Bellman operators.* Envelope Theorem. This is a calculus formula for calculating marginalvalues, such marginal benefit of saving money. The main concepts are:differentiable support functions, the Benveniste-Scheinkman theorem.",

These are topics of key importance in modern macroeconomics and should be taken by students who plan to do a PhD on macroeconomic theory or applied macroeconomics.",
    "course_description": "The course will be divided into two main components as follows:Component 1: The Endogenous Business Cycle Theories. (Dr. Sun) Two sessions;There is a long tradition in the history of economics thoughts suggesting that booms sow the seeds of the subsequent busts. However, this view that business cycles are endogenous plays a small role in mainstream business cycle theory, which is dominated by the view that business cycles are exogenous. Exogenous business cycle theory views business cycles as essentially \"the random summation of random causes\". The standard Real Business Cycle (RBC) theory is such an example. Should there be no shocks, the economy will converge to steady state in which there are no fluctuations. By contrast, endogenous business cycle theory says that even when there are no shocks, the economy will still fluctuate perpetually in a deterministic way. Hence, cycles are embedded in the economic system.This part of the course will introduce students to the recent developments in endogenous business cycle theory.In the first lecture, we will see how demand complementarity may endogenously generate business cycles. Beaudry et al., (2015) and (2018) develop a model that captures this idea. In their setup, booms and busts arise endogenously because agents want to concentrate their purchases of goods at times when purchases by others are high, since in such situation unemployment is low and therefore taking on debt is perceived as being less risky.In the second lecture, we will see how credit market imperfection can endogenously generate business cycles. We will study the model developed by Farboodi and Kondor (2021). In their model, lax lending standards will lead to high output growth but the deterioration of loan quality. When the loan quality is sufficiently low, lenders switch to tight standards, causing low output growth but a gradual improvement in the quality of loans. This eventually triggers a shift back to a boom with lax lending standards, and the cycle continues.Component 2: Inequality. Empirics and some theory. (Professor Jose V. Rodriguez Mora) Four sessions;Inequality is a prevalent topic in economics.First, we will look at what do we mean by inequality and explore different measures of inequality. We will look at different data sources, their pros and cons, and will look at distributional accounts. We will then look at the distribution of inequality across countries, and the evolution of inequality across time.We will also spend some time looking at intergenerational mobility and inequality of opportunity, its data challenges, and its measurement. We will explore what we know on its geographical distribution and its evolution over time.Finally, we will look at the theory. We will explore models of heterogeneity in different dimensions. Look at differences in human capital accumulation, models of relative advantage in the labor market, and ways of generating fat tails.",

    "summary": "Bayesian methods are increasingly used in econometrics, particularly in the field of macroeconomics. This is a course in Bayesian econometrics with a focus on the models used in empirical macroeconomics. It begins with a brief introduction to Bayesian econometrics, describing the main concepts underlying Bayesian theory and showing how Bayesian methods work in the familiar context of the regression model. Computational methods are of great importance in modern Bayesian econometrics and these are discussed in in detail. In light of the Big Data revolution, applied economists often face the situation where the number of variables under consideration is large relative to the number of observations and conventional econometric methods do not work well. We describe various methods that can be used with Big Data in the context of the regression model and emphasize the wider applicability of these methods in other modelling contexts. Subsequently, the course shows how Bayesian methods are used with models which are currently popular in macroeconomics such as Vector Autoregressions, state space models (including factor models and stochastic volatility models) and nonparametric methods such as regression trees.",

    "summary": "In this course we will investigate theories of how the value of a collection of corporate liabilities (such as shares and bonds) are affected by corporate actions. The type of corporate actions we are concerned with includes: (a) corporate \"financing\" decisions (i.e. where companies choose capital structure); (b) decisions about dividend payouts and debt policy; (c) the value of the option to default; (c) the impact of mergers and takeovers on the value of the relevant corporations; and (d) corporate \"real\" investment decisions (i.e. where the company invests in a new plant or machinery or designs a new product). The course is wholly theoretical in nature.",
    "course_description": "The financial state of the firmThe content in this class introduces you to various ways of understanding in broad terms the financial state of the firm, including assets and liabilities, balance sheets, income statements and cash flows. We consider the differences between investment decisions and financing decisions and discuss maximisation of shareholder value.Capital structure IThis class considers the capital structure of the corporation focusing on payout policy. We consider dividends and repurchases of stock. We focus on the controversy surrounding payout policy and the argument that dividend policy is irrelevant. We will discover that the theoretical view of dividend irrelevancy is dependent on the functioning of capital markets.Capital structure IIThis class considers debt policy with and without taxes and the costs of financial distress and agency problems. Modigliani and Miller propositions one and two are illustrated. We discover that in perfectly, competitive and informationally efficient markets, without corporate taxes, there is no impact on the value of the company when it has leverage. However, the introduction of corporate taxes where the interest payments on debt are tax deductible, illustrates a situation where the value of the company does increase. Theories of capital structure, including trade-off theory and the pecking order are discussed, as well as asymmetric information.Agency, mergers, corporate control and governanceThis class considers agency issues between owners and shareholders, applications such as bank funding and capital controls are considered; we also look at motives for mergers and the market for corporation control. The topic of corporate governance is also briefly covered in this class.Valuation and real options 1This class develops the concepts of net present value (NPV) and the internal rate of return (IRR) from a capital budgeting perspective. The limitations of net present value are discussed; for example, NPV analysis ignores the possible adjustments and choices that a firm can make before or after an investment project is undertaken. This is particularly important when considering the value of real options which happens when a firm faces a partially irreversible investment decision in an uncertain environment.Valuation and real options 2This class builds on the material presented in valuation and real options 1 and gives further analysis of real options including investment options, abandon (disinvestment) options, expansion options, timing options, and more. We use the conceptually useful decision tree methodology to understand the applications of real options and consider the more advanced techniques that are frequently applied to this area.",

Lectures provide material on the background, content and assumptions of economic theories and on their comprehension of the appropriate methods of investigation into economic phenomena.  The lectures provide guidance as to how particular economic doctrines and more general philosophical and methodological issues may be interpreted and judged.  Students' own reading is an essential input to the course: through this reading students can develop their own interpretive and evaluative skills.  Students can expect at the end of the course to be better equipped to make their own choices as to questions, theories and approaches, and to understand better the scope and limitations of economic theory.  The course covers the history of economic thought and of ideas concerning the appropriate methods of enquiry in economics, from the pre Enlightenment period up to the present day with particular emphasis on important developments.",

Students will be expected to choose a research question in economics but specifically one that allows them to demonstrate the mathematical, statistical, numerical and programming skills they have acquired throughout the year. One example of such a research project may be as follows. Take a seminal mathematical model in a leading journal, replicate its results by programming and simulating it. Demonstrate an understanding of the model by interpreting the results of these simulations. Then in later chapters extend the model - e.g. by relaxing one of its assumptions - and via use of the same quantitative techniques as before, show how the extension changes the model's predictions. As an alternative (or supplement depending on time and space) to the extension, further analysis of the model in an empirical dimension may also be undertaken. This may involve the collection and processing of relevant data and the application of relevant econometric techniques.",

The overarching questions we seek to address are: Why does earnings inequality exist? Why do some workers earn more while others earn less? The aim is to provide students with up-to-date knowledge in labour economics and to encourage the development of independent research interests for those considering postgraduate research in this field. This course mostly focuses on non-structural applied micro.",
    "course_description": "The course is organised as weekly three-hour lectures. The intended structure is as follows, though adjustments may be made depending on the specific topics covered:The first 75 minutes will be dedicated to an in-depth exploration of theoretical concepts related to the week's topic.The following 75 minutes will focus on discussing, critiquing, and evaluating relevant published papers, allowing for a deeper understanding of both the content and the practical implications of the research.The final 30 minutes will be devoted to hands-on learning, during which we will work with real data sets and apply the concepts covered through problem sets. The core idea is to allow the students to engage with the course material in a different way, focusing on being a producer rather than a consumer of research.There are two parts to the course. Part A, which is taught by Dr Soledad Giardili, and Part B, which is taught by Dr Maia GÃ¼ell.Part A:Human Capital - Labour is not a homogeneous input to production. Workers can differ in innate skills and acquired skills. Skills can be acquired outside work (by going to school for instance) or on the job (e.g. by learning from your peers). The objective of this lecture will be to understand what the economic reasons are that lie behind the decision of individuals to acquire education and on-the-job training. We also want to explore how these decisions shape workersÂ¿ income over their lifetime. We will analyse empirical studies estimating the return to human capital with a focus on identification issues. We will also study how the empirical literature has disentangled the productivity effect from the signalling effect of human capital.Firms, Minimum Wages, and Unions - In this lecture, we examine the demand for labour by firms and explore how it is influenced by institutional factors such as minimum wages and unions. We will explore how minimum wages can affect employment and wage distribution, particularly in markets where competition is not perfect. Similarly, we explore the role of unions on employment rates and income inequality.Compensating Wage Differentials - This lecture will provide an understanding of how differences in tastes and in job characteristics can affect the distribution of wages and explain how compensating wage differentials are determined and how to interpret an hedonic wage function. We will also look at key empirical issues in estimating compensating wage differentials and examples when the theory does not hold.Discrimination - We will explore whether group identity matters and how it translate into differences in labour market outcomes. We will explore the two classic types of discrimination: taste-based, closely connected to compensating differentials, and statistical, closely connected to learning. We will discuss empirical work on Becker outcome tests and why audit studies are unsatisfying.Part B:Unemployment - Labour markets feature unemployment. We will study unemployment to understand how labour markets work. We will place special emphasis to both the level of unemployment as well as unemployment duration. Heterogeneity in unemployment rates and the incidence of long-term unemployment across countries as well as workerÂ¿s characteristics will be discussed. Empirical models that estimate the determinants of unemployment duration will also be covered.Migration - One aspect of globalisation is increased migration flows from one country to another in order to work. We will study the effects of migration on the local economy in terms of labour market outcomes, including unemployment. We will consider the case of workers being substitutes and complements, as well as short run and long run effects.Insurance Policies - Having studied the workerÂ¿s risk of unemployment, we will close this part by studying the main public policies that try to insure workers. We will mainly focus on unemployment insurance and firing costs and the effects that the policies themselves have on labour market outcomes.",

    "summary": "The formulation of sound economic policy invariably involves striking a right balance between equity and efficiency, between social justice and incentives. After reviewing the causes for market failures, we examine the trade-off between equity and efficiency inherent in the problem of income taxation. We then examine the inefficiency of private provision of public goods, followed by the Samuelson conditions for Pareto efficiency. Finally, we study the Tiebout hypothesis and the theory of local public goods. We conclude the lectures by reflecting on the optimum decentralization of public decisions between local government and central government.",

This section comprises both procedures commonly recognised as good practice and issues for which there is - as yet - no clear consensus. Areas include ethical concerns involving human participants, motivation of subjects and statistical techniques.* Strands of experimental research: The goals are twofold. First, to give students an overview of the literature in experimental finance and economics. Second, to enable students to identify promising areas for future experiments. Areas include experiments designed to test economics and finance theories, experiments designed to discover stylised facts, experimental work applied to policy questions, as well as work seeking to unify experimental results.",

In the first part of the course, students will learn about the most popular methods for classification and prediction, as well as tools for working with large datasets. The second part of the course focuses on practical tools for working with text and string variables, including statistical text analysis methods. The course is delivered through a series of lectures that include in-class Python examples.",
    "course_description": "This course provides an introduction to the main methods in Machine Learning, Big Data and Text Analysis and it discusses some empirical applications in the Economic literature.This course combines lectures, in-class examples, and exercises to teach students how to implement machine learning methods with actual data. Examples and studies from the economics literature are used to illustrate some of the topics. While no previous knowledge of machine learning or experience with Python is required, experience with data and programming in statistical packages like Stata is highly recommended. The course aims to provide essential elements required to implement theoretical algorithms using real data but does not provide a deep training in Python.The first part of the course gives an overview of the most popular methods for classification and prediction and discusses some tools for working with large datasets. Prediction and classification are the two most important tasks that ML can perform. The empirical literature in Economics is increasingly relying on these tasks with two purposes. First, to understand features in the data. Second, to analyse and organize large datasets in order to generate new information in a semi-automated way, a process also known as Data Mining. This new and user-ready information extracted from large and/or unstructured datasets (such as images or text corpuses) is used later to answering economic research questions.The second part of the course covers a number of practical tools and methods for working with text data and string variables. Text has rapidly become a major source of information for Economic studies, but traditional statistical methods are unfeasible to analyse this type of data. The typical size of these databases and the complex dependencies across the elements in the text (e.g. across words) require that analysis are performed using Machine Learning methods.",

    "summary": "The Research Project is an opportunity to investigate an economic subject in depth, undertaken in groups of up to 5 students, under the guidance of an experienced economist. It provides an opportunity to apply core economic concepts and theories to research a topic, to develop computational modelling skills, qualitative and quantitative analysis and interpretation of data, knowledge of statistical package, programming languages, experimental design, data collection techniques, etc., all of which increase studentsÂ¿ capacity for performing quantitative research in economics and to develop their transferable skills.",
    "course_description": "Like the MSc Dissertation, the Research Project is the most challenging element of the programme - undertaking it requires students to develop a deep level of analysis and understanding of core economic theory and econometrics. However, the project is suitable only for those students who intend to build their career outside of academia and thus would like to concentrate on further development of their transferable skills. Those students who contemplate building an academic career should develop the relevant skills by working on MSc dissertation instead.The Research Project is an opportunity to investigate an economic subject in depth, undertaken in groups of up to 5 students, under the guidance of an experienced economist. The project is expected to reflect the comparative advantages/competencies of the individual students in particular aspects of mathematical economics, econometrics, numerical methods, programming, data collection methods, literature research, critical analysis, and writing skillsThe topic will be agreed in consultation with the supervisor. The project normally involves students developing the methodology best suited to explore the subject, whether it involves standard data sources, big data, advanced numerical modelling, mathematical modelling, analytical methods, computer coding, critical literature survey, design of an economic experiment, collection of original data, and so on.The students will submit two types of outputs: a group report produced by the group and an individual report produced by each student individually and independently. The group report is expected to be a substantial piece of work. Given the synergy of the individual student competencies, peer support and peer-to-peer learning, the students are expected to achieve the level of accomplishment which surpasses what each individual student is expected to achieve on their own. It is expected that the distinction-level research report will have a substantial element of original contribution and will extend well beyond the supervisory input.The individual report will involve students producing the extended summary of the research report augmented by studentÂ¿s own further insights on the subject, method, and/or the relevant literature, including potential extensions. Students are expected to work on the individual report independently and without any consultation with the other group members. The format of the individual report will be decided by the supervisor for the entire group, and could be in the form of an essay, presentation slides, poster, research proposal, policy report, or other form which will allow students to develop their transferable skills.Single individuals may be allowed to work on the project at the discretion of the programme director in consultation with the project supervisor.",
