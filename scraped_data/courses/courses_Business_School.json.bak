It will locate changes in management accounting practice within the context of technological, organisational, and broader social and economic change. It will investigate why conventional control systems cannot explain organisational form and governance choices in contemporary settings. We will reflect on the strategic relevance of controls by problematising the role of MACS in various sectors and cases, including topics from new directions in MACS research, such as the roles of accounting in grand challenges and the management of crises, the visualisation of accounting formation, and accounting and control in platform organisations. Upon completing this module successfully, students are expected to understand better topics such as Strategic Management Accounting and Control, Performance Measurement and Management, and Inter-Organisational Relations. This will enable them to have a more profound appreciation of the organisational, strategic, and societal impact of accounting.",
    "course_description": "This advanced course will provide a historically and sociologically informed understanding of the changing role of Management Accounting and Control Systems (MACS) in organisations and society. It will enable students to theoretically locate changes in management accounting practice within the context of technological, organisational, social, and economic change. In so doing, it will enable students to hone their critical thinking abilities, which are vital for an effective understanding of how MACS is used in managing organisations.Outline Content1. Management accounting goes digital2. Control in an age of empowerment: The levers of control3. Linking performance measurement and strategy execution: The Balanced Scorecard4. Executing strategy with the Balanced Scorecard and Strategy Maps5. Inter-organisational Relations I: Transaction cost economics & MACS in markets and hierarchies6. Inter-organisational Relations II: MACS in hybrids and accounting for platform organisation7. Budgeting, power, and irrationality8. MACS in High-Reliability Organisations (HROs) and crises9. Communication, persuasion, and deception: Visualising accounting information10. Revision, synthesis, and assessment preparationStudent Learning ExperienceThis module will adopt a topic-based approach, strongly emphasising independent learning. Students will receive reading materials (almost exclusively research papers) ahead of each lecture, and the lectures will focus on specific aspects of the readings, helping students contextualise the materials. Due to the modules broad coverage of numerous topics, many lacking definitive answers, the assessment will emphasise students critical thinking and analytical abilities.",

Secondly we consider demand and forecasting followed by cost theory and measurement. Then we put these two topics together and consider pricing policy with a particular interest in the interactions between firms. Next we consider pricing and other behaviour which is constrained by government competition policy. We then turn to another managerial policy: advertising decisions and then consider a very common problem: markets where the buyer or seller has different information compared with the other.

Acting as a board of directors, students set the direction for the company to build up the business by making decisions related to its strategy, finance, market, operations, staffing and innovation. It aims to foster interdisciplinary decision-making in an inexact environment and to prepare students for the problems and issues of working in a changing and uncertain world. This course has a quota of 120 students.",
    "course_description": "Business Simulation is built around a computer-based business simulation of a technology company start-up. Students on the course are formed into company teams of six or so members who will self-allocate themselves into the different board of director roles (Strategy, Finance, Marketing, Operations, HR/Organisation and Innovation) to manage their simulated company through a series of five simulation rounds that represent two years in the life of the company.The purpose of the course is to provide an experiential learning environment where the connectivity of the different functions within a business is made explicit. Students will have the opportunity to apply their learning from the earlier elements of their degree programme to the problems presented by the simulation; and are required to develop the business, justifying and reporting the decisions they make for their simulated firm.Students will also learn via taught classes each week. These will cover (in the order indicated below) the various business functions that relate to running a business, focusing initially on lessons drawn from the simulated environment then introducing guest lectures where a practitioner will present a talk about their business experience. This provides a link between the theoretical and practical nature of business management and background and context for the various company groups in managing their business start-ups.Syllabus:L1: IntroductionL2: The aims, structure and function of a businessL3: Planning for a start-up businessL4: Organising a small businessL5: Effective team workingL6: Guest Speaker: Case Example - Organising a small business.L7: Market analysisL8: Marketing and sales strategyL9: Operations managementL10: Guest speaker: Case Example - Operations in a Small BusinessInnovative Learning WeekNon-teaching weekL11: Measuring business performanceL12: Guest speaker: Case Example - Financing a Small BusinessL13: Finance options for business expansionL14: Guest Speaker: Contemporary issues in new venture financeL15: InnovationL16: Guest speaker: Case Example: Disruptive InnovationL17: Leadership in the context of small businessL18: Guest speaker: Leading Successful New VenturesL19: Debrief and lessonsL20: Guest Speaker: Growth Strategies and Crossing the ChasmStudent Learning ExperienceAs a course, Business Simulation is built around a computer-generated business start-up simulation. Students are formed into groups of six to be the managers of a business start-up where they have to make the necessary strategic, marketing, financial, operational and organisational decisions for their start-up and throughout the course of the simulation which over the duration of the course will represent two years of the business' operations.

    "summary": "To achieve a sustainable future, we need to address grand challenges, such as climate change, environmental degradation, poverty, and inequality. These challenges are interconnected and businesses play an important role in addressing them. In this course, we will consider sustainability as a systems condition and explore how businesses can adapt to help address these environmental and social challenges. To do so, this course will introduce you to the conceptual foundations of sustainability in business contexts. This allows you to develop familiarity with core concepts, theories, and terminology around business and sustainability. Moreover, we will develop your awareness and understanding of some of the major challenges that business leaders are facing in addressing sustainability issues, and how to overcome them. Throughout the course, we will draw on case studies to better understand the opportunities and challenges that business leaders face in this process. At the end of the course, you should have a foundational understanding of sustainability, which will be a necessary part of business in the coming decades.",
    "course_description": "Todays sustainability challenges are varied and include grand challenges such as climate change, environmental degradation, poverty, and inequality. The aim of this course is to develop the understanding of the role that organisations can and will have to play in achieving the system-wide changes that are required for a sustainable future. Therefore, the course is designed to introduce students to sustainability as a systems condition. We will explore how organisations need to assess their role within this system, what organisations can do to help drive system-change as well as to develop more sustainable business models, products, and services. To help students develop and understanding of the challenges that business leaders face, this course will reflect on the complexities of implementing transformative changes into business practice. In doing so, we will move from the societal to the individual level, and explore how the different levels are interrelated.This course introduces students to both mainstream and non-mainstream theories on sustainability and leadership, as part of the larger efforts to decolonise the curriculum, which not only helps students learn about different understanding and approaches but also exposes them to a wider toolkit on which they can draw to meet sustainability goals.",

    "course_description": "Entrepreneurship has become one of the most powerful and influential forces of change in the world. Technological innovation driven by scientific research has led to radical social and economic changes. Companies like Apple, Facebook, Genentech, and Cisco, all derive their success in part due to the innovative application of novel technology. But advanced technology alone is not sufficient to guarantee either user adoption or commercial success. Many ideas and technologies are abandoned or ignored despite presenting apparently significant advantages over incumbent systems.This course introduces students to the theory and practice of entrepreneurship. It focuses specifically on how and why some innovations are successfully commercialised, with particular emphasis on the role of the innovator-entrepreneur, with specific reference to science-driven innovation relevant to students programmes of study.This course teaches some of the generic and transferable skills required to become an entrepreneur, and raises the student's awareness of the legal, business, managerial, creative, analytical and interpersonal skills relevant to setting up and running an innovative organisation.Because of the online course format, the course lectures are available online at any time. Students are strongly encouraged to watch the course presentations on the weekly course schedule. Students who fall behind the lectures or any other course content may find it difficult to get caught up again.The course covers ten (10) topics associated with entrepreneurship:1. Entrepreneurial motivation2. Entrepreneurial characteristics3. Contexts of entrepreneurial activity4. Opportunity recognition5. Opportunity assessment6. Acquiring resources7. Business models8. Entrepreneurial activities9. Leadership and social entrepreneurship10. Exits and outcomesA fundamental outcome of entrepreneurship is the creation of new value, usually through the creation of new products and services which may lead to the creation of a new business entity. The objective of this course is to demonstrate and understand that exploiting a new opportunity is a process that can be planned, resourced, and managed. To start a successful business, an entrepreneur must exercise motivation as well as enterprising and managerial skills. He or she requires access to resources to grow the business; not just investment but social resources as well. Overall success is not just related to the nature of market opportunities but to the entrepreneurial and managerial motivations and skills of the entrepreneur.Student Learning ExperienceThe course centres on three objectives:1. Facilitating student identification and exploration of entrepreneurial opportunities,2. Supporting student development of knowledge and skill related to success in entrepreneurial activity3. Encouraging student self-evaluation with regard to entrepreneurial interest, intent, and capabilities.This course utilizes multiple learning modes, including: independent reading, primary research, lecture, group discussion, case studies, and exposure to practice. Students who participate in and engage with every mode are most likely to gain the most learning from the course. Preparation for every lecture session is essential, as students are expected to be active participants in their own and others' learning experience.",

    "course_description": "This course aims at introducing business students to the topic of software engineering and it is the building block of many quantitative courses. Indeed, being able to collect and transform data, perform analyses on them, and do this in an efficient way, is the basic setup of many topics in statistics, financial modelling, operational research, and so on. By providing a thorough background in the building blocks of programming and its applications, this course aims to provide non-technical profiles with the necessary basics to be mature in a quantitative environment. A direct connection with major quantitative business problems will be made through case studies and exercises.Outline ContentThe course will cover the following topics:- An introduction to programming concepts: differences between programming languages, computer compiling, data types, programming styles, and programming building blocks- Programming constructs: data structures, programming control flow, basic algorithms- Business applications:  a study on a range of business problems from statistics and operations research to illustrate the conceptsStudent Learning ExperienceTeaching will take the form of class lectures, and lab sessions. Since software engineering is a real learning-by-doing topic, the concepts and methods discussed during the lectures will be illustrated and transformed into exercises on Python which will help you to develop your skillset gradually. Assignments will introduce various topics one at a time, but will gradually become more difficult as they start combining different concepts. Nevertheless, they provide iterative feedback on a weekly basis and engage students to keep up with the course.",

While both aims are pursued simultaneously through the semester, the \"transition\" element is specifically addressed with skills sessions and components to acclimatise students to university learning, and how to achieve positive university outcomes. The business component is addressed through consideration of topics such as digital, environmental and social disruption facing business, and trends including consumption and the future of work. By applying the skills to the topics, students learn the importance and value of critical thinking, discussion, and argument.",
    "course_description": "To achieve the twofold aim of this course, it is designed to engage with the following academic topics:Transition to university learning, covering topics including:o Working in teams: the benefits, the difficulties, and how to overcome these;o Quality of Argument: what is an argument, what is a strong line of reasoning, how is it relevant in a business context?o Strength of Evidence: what are credible and reliable sources of evidence, how do we know, how do we find and use them?o Clarity of Communication: how can we present arguments and evidence clearly and persuasively, what are different presenting formats (eg written and oral) and how do they differ?Business in a global context with topics taught including (although these may vary based on dominant and pressing issues which emerge):o Understanding Business (its roles and responsibilities in society; traditional forms of organising and the implications of these; alternative organisational forms and their traction in society);o Digital Disruption (digital advances and impacts on firm structures and practices; emergence of new business models such as the shift of a collaborative economy; enablement and empowerment versus loss of jobs and alienation);o Globalisation (the process of international integration arising from the interchange of world views, products, ideas and mutual sharing; advances in transportation, telecoms, internet, mobile; implications of these for trade, transactions, economic and cultural development; the movement of people and dissemination of knowledge including winners and losers from this process);o Environmental disruption (including climate change, water, energy, food and clear air; how this creates uncertainty and opportunity; impacts on resource insecurity; market shifts and their implications);o Changes in Consumption (growth of emerging economies; markets at the bottom of the pyramid; consequences of demographic changes; rethinking consumption and the movement to an 'experience' economy);o New Forms of Work (changing expectations of 'work' especially relating to generational shifts, implications of digital disruption on engaging workers, implications of issues including digital disruption and global inequality on workers' rights and conditions; role of leadership in this changing context).Student Learning ExperienceStudents will receive lectures and topic seminars. The lecture component will comprise of a skills lecture and a further lecture will be dedicated to exploring the business topics listed above. This will form the basis for the weekly topic seminar, in which students will be guided by their tutor in a discussion based session, and will also practice skills. Students will be expected to prepare for the topic seminars and also carry out additional reading and activities around each topic.",

    "summary": "This course examines the nature and meaning of human resource management (HRM) set against the backdrop of institutional frameworks, recent changes in the economy and the labour market as well as contemporary organisational strategies. It has both a UK and an international focus and it treats HRM as a blanket term to describe the employment relationship in any organisation rather than focusing on HRM as a particular style of management. The course draws heavily on research analysing contemporary developments in HRM and employment, and wherever possible we draw out implications for real-life organisations and HR policy and practice.",
    "course_description": "The course focuses on a number of key themes to provide a critical flavour of the subject.  We adopt a broadly critical approach by i) questioning whether HRM leads to beneficial outcomes for workers as well as for employers and society and ii) offering insight into the practical and conceptual significance of change processes currently affecting HRM in Britain and overseas.HRM 2 is especially suited to those who want an introduction to HRM and employment issues and are taking it as part of a degree programme where an understanding of HRM is seen as an important complement to their specialist studies.  As such, it is appropriate for students from a diverse range of backgrounds - offering a critical (and essential) overview of HRM for students working towards a business degree as well as offering an essential foundational perspective for students studying for the Business with HRM degree.Following an overview of the economic and labour market context, the impact of key stakeholders (i.e. management, unions, the State, and global actors such as the EU and multinationals) on organisations and HRM policy formulation and practice is examined in detail.  The remainder of the course considers HRM in key practice areas such as recruitment and selection; training and development; performance management; remuneration; work-life balance; workplace discipline; career management; and equality and diversity.Outline ContentIntroduction: The Economic & Labour Market ContextSECTION 1: KEY STAKEHOLDERSKey Stakeholders 1: Management- Best practice/high commitment approach to HRM- Best fit/Resource based view of HRMKey Stakeholders 2: Trade Unions- Trade unions & collective bargainingKey Stakeholders 3: The State- A feature of employment law: National Minimum WageKey Stakeholders 4: Global Actors- European Work Councils - Information & Consultation with Employees- Multinationals & HRMSECTION 2: MANAGING EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS & HRM- Recruitment and selection- HRM & Employer branding- Remuneration systems- Equality & diversity- Work-life balance- Training & development- Workplace discipline, grievance and dismissal- Employee involvement & engagement- Managing Careers- Managing ConflictStudent Learning ExperienceThe formal lectures provide an overview of the essential features of the subject, together with guidance on the content of recommended reading and current sources of additional information.  Given the contemporary nature of the subject, reliance is placed upon current periodicals as the chief source of reading material (a range of top quality titles such as Human Resource Management, Journal of Management Studies, British Journal of Industrial Relations etc.) are recommended.The tutorial topics are detailed in the course booklet. Attendance at tutorials is compulsory.  At each meeting one student/a small group of students will be responsible for preparing and presenting the tutorial topic as a basis for subsequent group discussion.  Topics are allocated in advance to allow adequate preparation, and include predominantly focus on organisational case studies in order to allow students to consider lecture material from the practitioner angle. However, other approaches such as Web-based projects and practical and literature-based exercises have also been incorporated to enhance students' learning experience through tutorial discussions.",

    "course_description": "Entrepreneurship has become one of the most powerful and influential forces of change in the world. Technological innovation driven by scientific research has led to radical social and economic changes. Companies like Apple, Facebook, Genentech, and Cisco, all derive their success in part due to the innovative application of novel technology. But advanced technology alone is not sufficient to guarantee either user adoption or commercial success. Many ideas and technologies are abandoned or ignored despite presenting apparently significant advantages over incumbent systems.This course introduces students to the theory and practice of entrepreneurship. It focuses specifically on how and why some innovations are successfully commercialized, with particular emphasis on the role of the innovator-entrepreneur, with specific reference to science-driven innovation relevant to students programmes of study.This course teaches some of the generic and transferable skills required to become an entrepreneur, and raises the student's awareness of the legal, business, managerial, creative, analytical and interpersonal skills relevant to setting up and running an innovative organization.Because of the online course format, the course lectures are available online at any time. Students are strongly encouraged to watch the course presentations on the weekly course schedule. Students who fall behind the lectures or any other course content may find it difficult to get caught up again.The course covers ten (10) topics associated with entrepreneurship:1. Entrepreneurial motivation2. Entrepreneurial characteristics3. Contexts of entrepreneurial activity4. Opportunity recognition5. Opportunity assessment6. Acquiring resources7. Business models8. Entrepreneurial activities9. Leadership and social entrepreneurship10. Exits and outcomesA fundamental outcome of entrepreneurship is the creation of new value, usually through the creation of new products and services which may lead to the creation of a new business entity. The objective of this course is to demonstrate and understand that exploiting a new opportunity is a process that can be planned, resourced, and managed. To start a successful business, an entrepreneur must exercise motivation as well as enterprising and managerial skills. He or she requires access to resources to grow the business; not just investment but social resources as well. Overall success is not just related to the nature of market opportunities but to the entrepreneurial and managerial motivations and skills of the entrepreneur.Student Learning ExperienceThe course centres on three objectives:1. Facilitating student identification and exploration of entrepreneurial opportunities,2. Supporting student development of knowledge and skill related to success in entrepreneurial activity3. Encouraging student self-evaluation with regard to entrepreneurial interest, intent, and capabilities.This course utilizes multiple learning modes, including: independent reading, primary research, lecture, group discussion, case studies, and exposure to practice. Students who participate in and engage with every mode are most likely to gain the most learning from the course. Preparation for every lecture session is essential, as students are expected to be active participants in their own and others learning experience.",

The course is a practical course and is designed to give a theoretical introduction to financial markets.The course looks at the way assets are valued in financial markets. It considers interest rates and the pricing of fixed-income bonds; stock market prices and returns; stock market risk and the influence of risk on the pricing of shares; and the characteristics and pricing of financial futures and options.",
    "course_description": "You have only to think back to the recent financial crisis to realize the impact financial markets have in todays world. But that is not the only reason it is important to understand how financial markets work. All decision making implicitly requires an assessment of risk, possible returns and the trade-off between them. In financial decision making these assessments comes to forefront and they are most explicit in pricing of assets traded in financial markets. This course aims to develop students understanding of the basic principles of financial markets and provides an introduction how assets are valued and traded in those markets. The course considers stock market prices and returns; stock market risk and the influence of risk on the pricing of shares.It also considers exchange rates, interest rates and the pricing of bonds; and the characteristics and pricing of financial futures and options. But the most important contribution of this course to your future career is how to use the latest academic insights to better assess risks and returns, and the trade off between the two in your future decision making.Scientific insights develop and change over time. Traditional views on financial markets are changing rapidly and many of the standard paradigms and theory are nowadays questioned. On the one hand because of recent developments like the recent financial crisis, on the other hand because new theoretical and empirical developments in the academic literature. This course aims to consider issues from different perspectives. It will address both the standard theory but also offer some of the new and alternative views. It is not only important to be aware off those different views from an practical point of view but it is also important for students who want to follow an academic career.Finance is a field that relies strongly on the interaction between academic and practitioners knowledge. Therefore will pay close attention to the relation between academic and practical developments.Student Learning ExperienceIntroduction to Financial Markets is an introductory finance course and has been structured in such a way as to assume no prior knowledge of finance. The student's success will be determined mostly by the time they invest in mastering the material.Ideally the student:- Prepare for the lecture by reading the relevant a chapter(s).- Attend the lecture- Study the relevant chapter(s) after the lecture to put the lecture in context- Use the Bodie, Kane and Marcus website and other materials for self assessments- Dedicate serious time to work on the study questions before the tutorial- Participate in the tutorial- Revisit all study material before the examsFinance is to a large extent an acquired way of thinking and some acquire this way of thinking faster than others (good numerical skills, but also common sense and talent help). Active engagement with multiple choices questions and exercises will improve the student's likelihood of success.What may further help improve the student's skills beyond the study material is to read about financial markets in the real world (like the Financial Times) and apply the knowledge and insights from this course, or invest in (simulated) portfolios. There are numerous websites where students can practice trading and investing. There are academic articles that may be accessible to students at the undergraduate level. The Financial Analyst Journal is a good starting point.",

Hence a good understanding of organisational behaviour is useful to anyone working in any organisation, and particularly for those in managerial or leadership roles.The overall aim of the course is to develop in students an understanding of the complex issues involved in the spheres of work, employment and the management of people in an organisational setting.",
    "course_description": "The purpose of this course is to understand organisations and the factors that make them work effectively. The course covers a wide range of topics to help you understand the principles and processes that underpin effective organisation. In this course we aim to show how organisational behaviour concepts, theories and techniques can be applied in work and management settings.The lectures emphasise the importance of adopting a critical and analytical stance in understanding and interpreting how people behave in organisations, and the most appropriate means of managing or regulating that behaviour.Outline Content- The environment- Personality- Communication- Perception- Motivation- Groups and teams- Leadership- Power and politics- Conflict- Organisational culture- Organisational structures- Managing changeStudent Learning ExperienceHigh standards of lecture delivery are supported by incorporating, where appropriate, alternative teaching delivery methods such as case studies. In addition, case study teaching (mainly in tutorials) is employed as a means of emphasising the interconnected nature of managerial processes and of drawing on actual organisational experience.The compulsory weekly tutorials comprise a mixture of practical exercises, case study tasks and analysis of journal articles, and are used to provide opportunities to test and evaluate theories and techniques learned in lectures. In addition, active participation in tutorials will lead to the development of analytical skills (through problem identification, data handling and critical thinking),decision making skills (generating alternative explanations, selecting decision criteria, evaluating alternatives, hypothesising on issues of implementation and consequences), and communication skills (listening to colleagues, constructing arguments, thinking on feet and convincing others).",

The objectives of the course are achieved by active pedagogies, which means there is a strong component of independent learning and teamwork developed through different activities.",
    "course_description": "This course brings different ways of thinking to bear on contemporary business questions. Success in the workplace will increasingly depend on the capacity to consider challenges from multiple perspectives by drawing on many lenses and ways of thinking. Each week, a discipline will explore business challenges from its particular ways of thinking, drawing on specific knowledge and tools to how business issues are identified and conceptualised. The tutorials are student-centred, and provide students with guidance and support to focus on contemporary business problems, and conduct research in real-time while they work with their peers.Outline content:The course will draw upon a range of disciplines (or lenses) and these may vary according to student demand and academic expert supply.Typically, each discipline would be explored for two lectures, and the course would seek to understand how we can apply the discipline to different aspects of business using illustrative examples - either a work or a body of work, or a business case study viewed through the lens in question. Lenses are likely to include:Cultural Studies - business as understood and represented in popular culture.Politics - how political ideas shape business and the business environment.Philosophy - how philosophical concepts help us understand business practices today.Sociology  - sociological interpretations and explanations of online and offline business practices.Data Science - how new ways of thinking about data can be applied to business.Student learning experience:This course is designed to allow students to question and analyse business topics from many perspectives. A key requirement is to debate and interrogate the ideas, concepts and tools presented within the disciplines and evaluate their validity in contemporary business problem solving. Students will be encouraged to identify and use different sources of materials from within the disciplines and also working in groups on a weekly basis. They will be expected to undertake prescribed reading, attend live lectures and engage in weekly tutorials. Students will be assessed in 2 ways. They will be required to complete a short group video presentation on a business issue. They will also complete an individual essay which will adopt an interdisciplinary analysis of a current business challenge.",

    "course_description": "This elective is designed to provide an overview of an exciting new area in finance which takes as its premise that investment decision-making and investor behaviour are not necessarily driven by 'rational' considerations but by aspects of personal and market psychology. Behavioural finance recognises that our abilities to make complex investment decisions are limited, and that we can improve our performance as investors and fund managers by recognising the biases and errors of judgment to which all of us are prone.  The elective discusses what we know about the psychology of financial decision-making and explores the behaviour of both individual investors and finance professionals. Are markets really 'efficient'? How can we explain the existence of market anomalies?Outline Content- Is our decision making biased? what is behavioural finance?- Formal overview of investor psychology- Heuristic driven biases;- Other judgement biases, overconfidence and investor performance, selling winners too early and riding losers too long;- Recent advances in behavioural finance;- Emotional Finance;- Introduction to market anomalies;- Value puzzle;- Momentum paradox;- Post-earnings announcement drift;- Corporate events and long horizon returns;- Accruals anomaly, analyst recommendations anomaly;- Behavioural finance versus market efficiency.Student Learning ExperienceThe learning occurs primarily through reading and thinking about the papers or chapters of books recommended and discussion in class. This reading is supported by the programme of ten lectures, in each of which an overview of the topic is presented and the findings of a number of relevant papers are reviewed in some detail. Students are required to write two assessed reports. All students are expected to participate actively in class discussion.Learning takes place in four stages:1) Prior to each session students are required to complete the reading assignments given2) During the session the bullet points on the slides will be used to focus the discussion and to help to summarise key issues3) As the structure of the elective is designed to be cumulative students will be expected to bring their learning and insights from previous sessions to bear on subsequent sessions4) They will bring together and test out their understanding of the issues discussed in the course during the lecturesAt the end of each lecture topic there will be a set of questions some of them MCQ as well and feedback will be given each week.",

Increasingly, for better or worse, the logic of brands and branding can be seen in diverse areas of life, beyond consumer goods e.g. the political brand, branded religion and person as brand. In short our daily lives are saturated by brand messages and meaning.

    "course_description": "Taking a socio-cultural perspective, Brand Culture provides students with a deeper knowledge of the place of brands in the lives of consumers and the skills used to manage them. It does this by considering the meanings of brands and by outlining different brand strategies available to companies to both create meaning and meet the needs of consumers. We firstly explore the socio-cultural meaning of brands to equip students with an understanding of what a brand is, how they are used by consumers and from where their meaning is derived. With this grounding in place, we then move to explore the concepts of brand equity before discussing different approaches for managing brands.Student Learning ExperienceThe course is designed to deliver the space and skills to enable students to analyse brand meanings in relation to symbolic material such as marketing communications and, importantly, their own consumer behaviour. As such reflexivity and classroom discussion are central aspects of the course.",

    "course_description": "Honours Corporate Finance considers aspects of the financial management, financing and governance of companies believed to be of academic interest and practical importance. The aims are to introduce students to current thinking and empirical research on the chosen topics, and to develop skills of understanding, analysis and explanation. The course builds on the finance and accounting learned earlier in the degree programme, and so it assumes some knowledge of companies and financial reporting, and concepts such as discounted cash flow and the cost of capital. The course adds to students' knowledge mainly by examining empirical research on the topics studied. Research in corporate finance is a social science, the aim of which is to understand about value creation and financial decision-making as observed in the corporate sector. Students will learn about the current state of knowledge on each topic studied and about how research in corporate finance is conducted, through studying the research design and contribution to knowledge of carefully selected papers.Outline ContentThe syllabus will vary somewhat from year to year, depending on developments in the literature, the interests of the lecturer(s), and the content of other Honours courses in finance offered by the Business School. The course is helpful to students in thinking about dissertation topics, because it focuses on the design and results of empirical research projects.Student Learning ExperienceTuition consists of ten two-hour lectures together with a number of seminars in which we discuss specific questions relating to papers on the reading list. In each lecture an overview of the topic is presented and several papers are reviewed in some detail, to give insight into the current state of research on the topic.Students learning occurs primarily through engagement with the lectures and seminars, and through reading and thinking about the papers and other literature recommended. The assessed assignment for the course is currently an individual presentation of two empirical papers of the students choice. This assignment provides further opportunities to engage with the literature, and develops students skills of communication and explanation.",

    "summary": "*UNFORTUNATELY THIS COURSE IS NOT RUNNING IN 2019/20.*course quota 40*The cultural and creative industries are an important area of study. The Cultural and Creative Industries described by UK government as the Creative Industries are those industries 'which have their origin in individual creativity, skill and talent and which have a potential for wealth and job creation through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property'. British fashion, architecture, publishing, craft and design, film and TV, video games and software, museums, theatre, dance, popular and classical music and visual arts are internationally recognized as world class. 1.7 million people work in these UK industries. Together they contribute almost Â£77bn in value added, equivalent to 5.0% of the UK economy. The latest DCMS estimates show that they grew by 9.9% in 2013, higher than any other sector. Allowing for the contribution of creative talent outside the creative industries, the creative economy's share may be approaching one-tenth of UK's economy.Behind all these figures and within all these industries there are complex creative people, practices and processes and this brings distinct challenges, organisationally and managerially. Within this course we explore these complexities practically and theoretically.",
    "course_description": "This course seeks to give students an understanding of the cultural, social and economic importance of creativity and the creative industries, and insights into the organisational and management practices within the cultural and creative industries, in addition to insights into creative lives and creative work processes.  The course will have invited guest speakers from creative organisations and institutions, as well as academic specialists in the field of cultural and creative industries. The reflective learning practices and innovative, empirically based assessments aim to develop your practice-based skills for your future careers. In so doing this course aims to provide practically applicable knowledge and skills for those seeking to work within the cultural and creative industries, and organisations more generally - the practices that have been common in organisations in the cultural and creative industries are increasingly of particular relevance more broadly as organisations in other sectors seek to be creative, focused on performance, flexibly organised, work across organisational boundaries and engaged with customers/service users. This practice-based work will be done in conjunction with theory based learning i.e. theories of management in the creative industries, creative process, artistic and organisational practice within the cultural and creative industries, in addition to cultural entrepreneurship and leadership. Thus the course aims to provide an understanding of managing and organising creativity by interlinking theory and practice. Mutually productive links between theory and practice will be forged through reading and class examination of academic and practitioner literature; interdisciplinary learning with ECA cohorts; detailed analysis of particular examples and contexts; and engagement with industry partners.Syllabus:1.\tIntroduction2.\tCulture and creativity.

The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the classic work and latest developments in theory and research for a selection of marketing related topics, and in so doing, show the developments in understanding to an advanced level. As the essential reading for the course is based on articles from leading marketing journals which students read and critique in their own time, following guidance given in lectures, the course also aims to develop skills of independent thinking and critical reflection. In-class discussion questions and exercises supplement the reading to stimulate critical thinking and illustrate application of theories to practice and own experience.",
    "course_description": "Six topics are covered in the course: Development of the Marketing Concept; Market Orientation and the Firm; Marketing of Places; Marketing of Art and Culture; Ethical Dimensions of Marketing, and New Relations in Marketing. For each topic a set of background readings is recommended to help understanding of the main concepts and debates in the topic. Students are then directed to read deeply a selection of journal articles which contrast with each other in terms of approach and/or argument and/or managerial recommendations. Each topic is anchored around a key question, a fundamental question or concern facing theorists and practitioners involved in the topic - which provides a focus for learning about the topic and a starting point for critical thinking about the essential reading material. Each lecture session provides an introduction to a topic and an overview of the set journal articles, together with more in-depth treatment of 2-3 articles featured from the list. The sessions are designed to be interactive, with in-class discussion questions and opportunities for debate, therefore students are expected to familiarise themselves with the featured articles before each session. Assessment involves students undertaking critical reviews of the literature i.e. the set journal articles on the topics covered in the course.SyllabusIntroduction to the CourseCritical Reading and ThinkingDevelopment of the Marketing ConceptMarket Orientation and the FirmAssignment Preparation TutorialMarketing of PlacesMarketing of Art and CultureEthical Dimensions of MarketingNew Relations in MarketingOverall, the course aims to provide students not only with in-depth, subject-specific knowledge of the topics covered, but also with enhanced abilities to assimilate the key points of complex pieces of writing, and to question, challenge and critique them in a mature and reasoned way.

It aims to develop inter-personal, analytical and presentation skills; to give detailed insights into the  challenges and problems of a growing new business; and to gain practical knowledge in a live company of how these problems may be overcome and growth successfully generated.There will be a period of formal workshops  and preparation at the start of the course.  These will introduce consulting, the consulting process and the skills and tasks necessary to successfully undertake a short-term consulting assignment in a new growth orientated business.The central part of the course involves a consultancy assignment undertaken for the owner-manager of a new local business, to be recruited before the course starts. The businesses will be chosen under the direction of the course co-ordinator, who will also agree the briefs with the companies in general terms. Students will be assigned to teams of between three to six members.  It then becomes the responsibility of the team to negotiate the details of the project with the client, to negotiate resources (such as office space, telephone, faxes etc.), to schedule meetings and to produce, and present, such interim reports as the client deems necessary.The course will start with workshops on the consultancy process, research methodology, and advanced small business growth.

You will gain familiarity with the market for IPOs more generally and the IPO process in particular. Additionally, you will be introduced to seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). Relevant (empirical) research will be included aiming to help you develop a broad knowledge and understanding of issues relevant to the raising of equity capital.",
    "course_description": "You will familiarise yourself with the most important terms and issues surrounding equity financing. Through readings, you will learn about the processes and institutional setting of the primary market for equity financing, including the importance of the share allocation process in an IPO and the long-run performance of IPOs. Moreover, you will learn about SEOs and the short-term as well as long-term capital market reaction to this choice of financing. Readings will not only be based on standard books but will include a fair number of academic articles that elucidate contemporary issues relevant to equity financing. Deep understanding of these topics should equip you with a solid base of analytical and critical reasoning skills to help enable the pursuit of a wide array of careers including in investment banking, corporate finance and treasury management.Outline ContentTopics covered in this course include an introduction to the IPO market, sources of equity financing, the benefits and costs of going public, the mechanics of the going public process, the issue of IPO underpricing as well as the long-run performance of IPOs. Alternatives to the IPO process will be discussed, too. Additionally, SEOs will be analysed, their reasons and empirical evidence on their capital market perception.Student Learning ExperienceThis course places a great emphasis on independent learning. Before each lecture, you will be provided with a list comprising 2-3 core readings and a number of additional readings. You are expected to read the core readings and ideally most if not all of the additional ones. The lectures will explore particular aspects of the readings and attempt to help you put materials in context. They are not a substitute for the readings. The nature of the material means that in many cases there may be no single acceptable answer. You are expected to learn how to argue a case that is supported by academic theory and empirical evidence.",

The focus will be on Residential mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and credit derivatives.",
    "course_description": "Globally, the fixed-income market is a key source of financing for businesses and governments. In fact, the total market value outstanding of corporate and government bonds is significantly larger than that of equity securities. Similarly, the fixed-income market, which is also called the debt market or bond market, represents a significant investing opportunity for institutions as well as individuals. Pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds, among others, are major fixed-income investors. Retirees who desire a relatively stable income stream often hold fixed-income securities. Clearly, understanding how to value fixed-income securities is important to investors, issuers, and financial analysts.This course aims to provide coverage of the products, analytical techniques for valuing bonds and quantifying their exposure to changes in interest rates and portfolio strategies to achieve business/client objectives. The focus will be on Residential mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and credit derivatives.Outline ContentThe sessions will contain reference to recent events, e.g., global financial crisis, Brexit and COVID. These events will be used to illustrate the behavioural aspects of debt securities.Topic 1: Main features of fixed income securitiesTopic 2: Bond price volatility, duration and convexityTopic 3: Bond portfolio immunizationTopic 4: Mortgage backed securitiesTopic 5: Bond portfolio construction and management strategiesTopic 6: Term structure models and treesTopic 7: Arbitrage free modelsTopic 8: Fixed income derivativesStudent Learning ExperienceThis module is only available to students with some finance background i.e. pre-requisite finance courses because of its technical and conceptual content.

Both allow users to modify and transfer risks, take speculative positions, and develop investment strategies and the markets in which they are traded are significant elements of most advanced economies. Key questions as to their applications and pricing form a specialist area in finance. In particular, options involve the development of complex models for, pricing and monitoring their behaviour. A sub-element of the course will examine the use and pricing of interest rate and cross-currency swaps.",
    "course_description": "The Honours course Futures and Options is part of the suite of honours courses offered by the Business School in finance. It is normally taken in the third year of study of the MA degree at the University of Edinburgh, and is part of the finance progression stream. The course aims to provide students with the tools, knowledge and understanding of the derivative product set (that is, forward contracts, futures, swaps and options), how the instruments are priced, and the markets in which they are traded. The emphasis is on financial management and pricing. To integrate the discussion of these instruments, the course stresses the relationships that exist between the different instruments and, in particular, the various no-arbitrage and replication conditions that underlie the fair pricing of derivatives. Note that the course does not delve into the more advanced aspects of derivatives pricing such as stochastic processes, although some understanding of this is required.Outline ContentIntroduction to Futures and OptionsForward and Futures Prices and Using FuturesCommodity FuturesSwaps 1: PricingSwaps 2: ApplicationIntroduction to Options and Option StrategiesPricing OptionsExtending the Models to Indices, Currencies and FuturesThe Greeks of Option Pricing:Exotic OptionsStudent Learning ExperienceFutures and Options is structured around the class programme supported by selected readings from the set text with some additional reference material.Outside of the formal class programme, students are expected to undertake additional self-study using the textbook by reading at least the recommended sections and other suggested references, including watching recommended videos. This will allow students to reinforce and expand on material introduced in the lectures.The assignment requires students to examine a particular aspect of the instruments being studied on the course with a view to developing a deeper understanding of the issues and processes involved. In delivering the assignment, students are required to identify, assess, evaluate, understand, and integrate material from a variety of sources and summarise it in a coherent and logical form.",

The course examines creative industries as cultural production systems by drawing on a variety of disciplines (economics, sociology, strategic management) and by utilising specific cases to understand their historical, cultural, structural and competitive dynamics. This course is available to both 3rd and 4th year students and focuses on organisational strategies and market systems for dealing with uncertainty and complex cultural products.",

Who can claim rights over a Banksy's work, given the anonymity of the artist? Exploring answers to these and other questions, the course aims to introduce students to the basic dimensions that constitute a creative industry. The course is organized around key roles and concepts in cultural production systems. Creative industries may be purpose-driven, expressing ideas, identities, aesthetics and culture; they may be profit-driven, seeking commercial success and competitive advantage. Most of the time, they pursue both aims, in various combinations. Creative industries include large global corporations, public entities, entrepreneurial firms and individual creators. They may serve local markets, export their services or products, or link producers and consumers. They involve different actors and possess distinctive properties. We will draw on three sources of knowledge: 1) theoretical frameworks and research findings from sociology, economics, and strategy; 2) cases and media accounts of specific organisations, and 3) guest speakers. We will discuss how value is created, organised, defined and protected; who are the actors involved in different creative industries; how creativity, innovation and change are made possible and sustainable; how knowledge from creative industries can be transferred to other business settings.The course is client-based: individually and in teams, you will work on a real problem faced by a cultural organisation based in Edinburgh, and develop strategic recommendations to address their issues. The consulting challenge will require intense group work, high-quality output, and frequent engagement with the client and the lecturer.In the first part of the course, as individuals, you will prepare an analytical overview of the client organisation applying sociological and economic frameworks. Your analysis will be presented as a slide deck, which will weight 35% on the individual final mark.In the second part of the course, as a team, you will analyse the challenges presented to you by the client organisation and develop solid and well-informed strategies for addressing these challenges. As a team, you will seek sources of information, analyse data, and present your analysis to the client. The lecturer and client organisation will provide feedback on the presentation, to be carefully considered in the writing and refinement of the final report.Final reports will be submitted to the lecturer for assessment and feedback (65% of the final mark, 20% of which is moderated through WebPA). Reports that meet a mark of 60 or above will be sent to the client by the lecturer. The client will provide a summary feedback on each teamÂ¿s report. The goal is to deliver a high-quality report to the client: content, design, and structure are expected to be in line with industry standards.",

    "course_description": "Rather than a country-by-country account, which can be excessively descriptive and devoid of analytical cohesion, the course adopts a thematic approach. The chosen themes and topics are structured in order to address the theoretical frameworks and on-going debates in the fields of international HRM and comparative employment relations. Within this framework, the chief integrative theme is the current debate concerning whether employment relations systems and practices are converging or diverging on a global basis and the role played by global actors such as multinational corporations (MNCs).The first section of the course begins with an overview of the divergent characteristics of national systems, the sources of such diversity, and how systems might be classified. The major controversy of convergence versus divergence of national employment relations systems is introduced, a theme developed through undertaking a more in-depth comparative analysis of 'national employment systems' specifically considering differences in liberal market economies and coordinated market economies as outlined by the Varieties of Capitalism framework.The next section critically examines the myriad challenges that MNCs face in a highly complex international business context, and provides students with various theoretical frameworks to critically analyse and understand contemporary trends in international human resource management. Topics such as global staffing, knowledge transfer, cross-border mergers and acquisitions, and global value chain are explored through careful readings of survey and case study results.SyllabusWeek 1: Globalisation, National Systems and Multinational CompaniesWeek 2: National Employment Systems and IHRMWeek 3: Employment Relations in Liberal Market EconomiesWeek 4: Employment Relations in Coordinated Market EconomiesWeek 5: Convergence and Divergence in Employment RelationsWeek 6: Global Staffing and Expatriate ManagementWeek 7: Transfer of Practices in MNCsWeek 8: IHRM in Cross-Border Mergers and AcquisitionsWeek 9: Global Value Chain and IHRMWeek 10: International Labour Standards and Corporate Codes of ConductStudent Learning ExperienceEach two-hour session combines a formal lecture and student group presentations on pre-assigned case studies during the class.",

    "summary": "Few companies these days could claim to be purely domestic. While the firm may confine its activities to the domestic market, the market itself is unlikely to be somewhat restricted and may be served by firms headquartered in or operating from a number of other foreign countries or regions. Knowledge of international issues is therefore of vital importance to all firms whether they are actively involved in marketing in foreign markets or have foreign competitors at home. The increased risk and complexity marketers face in international markets is due to the increased level of uncertainty from operating in diverse and less understood environments. The discussion of international marketing topics in this course is guided by a depth understanding of culture and how this informs the international marketing decision- making process. Building a strong foundation knowledge of culture informs at a macro level which countries a firm selects to enter; which market entry strategy they adopt and how the marketing mix must adapt depending on the cultural values on the country the firm chooses to enter.",

    "course_description": "Consulting activities and processes (such as the diagnosis of organisational problems, project management, the management of relationships with stakeholders and organisational change) are significant to many aspects of organisational life, and even those who are not formally employed as consultants will need to diagnose organizational problems, make interventions and assess the efficacy of their solutions.Consultancy is also an activity that has attracted critical commentary on a number of grounds, for example, that consulting is prone to promoting fads and that excessive fees are levied for interventions that are of limited value. In their future professional lives students will therefore benefit from an understanding of these issues.Syllabus- Introduction - The Consulting Industry and the Action Research Model- Types of consulting and Team Effectiveness- Project Management and Team \"Teach-ins\"- Team Presentations of Project Proposals- Collection, Structuring and Communication of Data- Organisational Change / Team Meetings & Tutor Consultations- Client Management- Consulting in Practice- Presentations to clients- Consulting in Context and Course Overview and DebriefStudent Learning ExperienceThe teaching method comprises three main components:a) A series of taught sessions covering a range of topics including the consulting industry, the consulting process, project teams and project management, data analysis, client management and critical perspectives on consulting.b) Interactive sessions in small groups (with tutors) discussing how ideas from the taught sessions apply to a live project.c) A consulting assignment with a real organisation, conducted in teams of 4-5, with an end-of-project presentation and group report for the client. This will run throughout the semester, but the period of peak effort leading up to submission of the final report and presentations to clients will fall in weeks 8-11. Each team will also make one presentation to the whole class at the project proposal stage.d) Various consultations and meetings to review progress with an assigned tutor, in small groups, throughout the semester.",

As per the Scottish Credit Qualifications Framework (SCQF), this means that it should entail approximately 400 hours of student effort. Successful completion requires considerable time devoted to researching the topic, gathering and analysing relevant data and writing up your study in the appropriate manner. Students should not underestimate the time required and the need to make an early start on reviewing the literature and undertaking your own research. In addition, if a student intends to use modes of enquiry with which he/she is not entirely familiar, he/she will need to spend time familiarising themselves with these. Writing up in an appropriate manner is also a lengthy process.It is, therefore, important for students to understand fully the need to 'front-load' their efforts as much as possible so as to allow plenty of time to complete the dissertation within the time allowed.",

The course will enable students to develop a critical understanding of organisational change via the theories and conceptual frameworks of organisation design and the principles and practices of organisational development. Both are critical to our understanding of organisations and how they function and both reside within a framework of organisation theory.",
    "course_description": "The course focuses on decisions that have to be made on the most appropriate organisational structure(s) to ensure dynamic delivery of organisational activities. Organisation design is about shaping an organisation to maximise its effectiveness; aiming for flexibility in delivery of its services. Through breaking down departmental barriers, seeking improved supply efficiencies, teamwork and collaboration and working towards better customer management and retention, organisations can enhance their performance and ensure that organisational goals and targets are achieved. Organisation design activities therefore focus on finding the most appropriate structures, relationships between departments and sections, and allocation of work activities, including definition of duties and role responsibilities. The module also focuses on how an organisation's culture, values and environment support and enhance organisational performance and adaptability.Organisation development is defined as a 'planned and systematic approach to enabling sustained organisation performance through the involvement of its people'. This might include how organisational members acquire new skills, knowledge and behaviours, and do things differently, often as part of the application of continuous improvement strategies. The concept of the 'learning organisation' as one of a number of organisation development strategies that might be adopted as part organisational change activities is also explored.Overall, the course aims to introduce students to a range of explanations that can help in the understanding of how organisations and their component groups and individuals approach change. In so doing, students will be encouraged to explore a range of practical techniques that can be used in dealing with change. The course requires critical reflection on theory and practice from an ethical and professional standpoint and provides opportunities for applied learning and continuous professional development.Syllabus- Introduction: managing change and types of change- History, paradigms, and models of change: why change organisations?- Organisational design and strategic change- Changing groups and changing individuals- Change leadership and change communications- Resistance and other reactions to change- Cultural change and organisational learning- The roles of power, politics, and ethics in managing change- Change agents, change agency, and the HR role in managing change- Technological change, evaluating change, and Course OverviewStudent Learning ExperienceThe two-hour class sessions combines lecture input, class and case discussions and student presentations.",

    "summary": "The role of the law within the employment relationship has become increasingly prominent in recent years, and the development of labour legislation has proceeded apace.  The complexities of the legal issues arising from employment are considerable.  It has become increasingly important that all organisational stakeholders such as managers, employees and trade unions, are familiar with the complex range of legal rights and obligations that surround the employment relationship.  Understanding the management of employment law is of considerable academic and practical relevance to students of management and organisation studies.",
    "course_description": "While we start from the assumption that recourse to the institutions of the law is a last resort for organisational actors, an understanding of the parameters and principles emanating from those institutions is crucial to successful organisational functioning.  This course will encourage students to think critically about the way in which the law both constrains and facilitates relationships between parties within work organisations, and its relationship to effective organisational functioning.  The course covers the following areas: the institutions of employment law; the contract of employment; implied rights and duties in the employment relationship; equality law; contractual variation, contractual breach and unfair dismissal.  Thus, the course will cover both the role of the common law in employer-employee relations, the existing (and expanding) statutory framework; the way in which relative standards of behaviour (for example, reasonableness or fairness) are interpreted and acted upon by tribunals and participants in organisations; critiques of law and practice in this area; how employers, employees and their representatives have positioned themselves in relation to existing and proposed developments in employment law; and the role of the law in contributing positively to the management of purposeful organisations.Outline Content- The framework of employment law: sources, institutions and context- The contract of employment: terms and conditions of employment, employment status and continuity of employment- Workplace disputes and termination of employment by dismissal- Redundancy & TUPE- Pay & working time- Privacy and confidentiality in the workplace- Discrimination 1: protected characteristics and prohibited conduct- Discrimination 2: discrimination in the employment context- Parental rights and work/life balance- Collective rights: trade unions & information and consultationStudent Learning ExperienceThe course comprises a mixture of formal lectures and group discussions.  The lecture programme will provide an overview of key issues, supported by a range of suggested readings.  Group discussions will focus upon understanding of the legal framework and its implications for organisational stakeholders, and on applying the legal framework to the problems confronting managers and employees in organisations.  Depending on student numbers, students may be given individual responsibility for analysing a particular case or issue, or applying their minds to hypothetical problems.  Students will be expected to participate in class discussions.  Questions for discussion will be distributed one week before each lecture and students may be asked to prepare a response to discuss at the lecture.The course project will allow students to apply a wider range of existing material to a more narrowly defined topic in an organisational context in order to encourage the development of stronger evaluative, rather than descriptive, skills.",

Key topics will include:-Understanding the third sector-The third sector and public services-Collaboration between state, business and the third sector-The impact of digital and AI technology on the sector-Social impact and innovation in the third sector-The critique and 'dark side' of the third sector-The third sector in developing economies and global southStudents will incorporate their past learning in management to their understanding of third sector, considering this in a global context. The course will also draw upon social policy, international development and public policy, and will be of interest to students from across the university.This course will enhance students' employability skills by embracing intellectual, analytical, critical knowledge of managing the third sector but also visualising and developing innovative third sector solutions to global grand challenges.",
    "course_description": "The course will draw on research knowledge about the third sector from a range of management disciplines, including strategy, organisational studies, service management marketing and innovation. It will also integrate these with knowledge from other disciplines including social policy, international development and public policy. Integrating theories from service management and public administration and management, the course will challenge students to explore the hybridity of third sector organisations and its implications for their management, how they balance social and business imperatives and the balance between the positive and the 'dark side' of third sector organisations. The third sector exists at the nexus of the public and private sectors, and is a significant source of employment for many students.The course will be delivered through lectures and associated seminars on the analysis of international real-life cases. Some lectures will be delivered by guest speakers from practice. Students will be expected to contribute to seminar discussions and group activities as well as to engage fully with guest speakers from practice. In the assessments, student will be expected to link their learning with these real-life management challenges, making explicit the links and proposing ideas for establishing third-sector organisations.",

In doing this, the module aims to encourage students to develop their own, well-informed understanding of, and position on, being and becoming a sustainable marketer and consumer.",
    "course_description": "Tackling the climate crisis appears at the top of the agenda for many organisations and marketing tools, techniques, and strategies are increasingly used by businesses, charitable organisations, and governments in order to influence stakeholder behaviours towards more sustainable outcomes, such as becoming net zero. This course focuses on the issues and challenges posed by the climate crisis and the role of marketers and consumers in this context. It aims to develop students understanding of the role of marketing and consumption in driving the sustainability agenda.The course gives students the opportunity to develop a range of transferrable skills through an innovative piece of assessment in the form of a podcast. Skills developed include communication and debating skills, technological and digital literacy skillsThe course is divided into 4 sections:Section 1: Context and theoretical foundationsSection 2: Consumption & climate changeSection 3: Contemporary marketing practices, questions, and challenges in the context of climate changeSection 4: The future of marketing in the climate crisisThis course will be delivered mainly through interactive lectures wherein active participation is highly encouraged. These will include a combination of lectures, case studies, class discussions, videos, debates. Several workshops will also form part of this course to support the assessment and skill development. As the course is designed to look at both marketing and consumption practices in relation to climate change, reflexivity on the students' own consumer behaviour is a central aspect of this course. It is expected that students engage with readings in advance of each class and actively contribute to, and participate in, classroom debates; the aim is to foster a collaborative, non-judgemental, and inclusive learning environment.",

    "course_description": "Optimisation problems are concerned with optimising an objective function subject to a set of constraints. When optimisation problems are translated in algebraic form, we refer to them as mathematical programs. Mathematical programming, as an area within Operational Research (OR), Management Science (MS) and Business Analytics (BA), is concerned with model building and strategies and methods for solving mathematical programs. In this course, we address model building in OR/MS/BA, present a variety of typical OR/MS/BA problems and their mathematical programming formulations, provide general tips on how to model managerial situations, and discuss solution strategies for a class of deterministic and/or under uncertainty problems. Last, but not least, students will learn how to use/build prescriptive analytics tools in the context of decision problems faced by business managers. The four main topics covered in this course are:Outline Conent1. Introduction to OR/MS and Model Building;2. Linear Programming (LP): Review of basic concepts and methods; namely, the simplex method and the dual simplex method, sensitivity analysis, and duality theory;3. Integer Programming (IP): Basic concepts, relationship with linear programming, strategies and methods of solving integer programs; namely, brand-and-bound algorithms, cutting plane algorithms, and brand-and-cut algorithms;4. Optimisation under Uncertainty: Basic concepts in two-stage stochastic programming and robust optimisation, relationship with deterministic equivalent formulations, and applications.Student Learning ExperiencesThis lecture and tutorial programme, which builds on knowledge from Management Science & Business Analytics courses in earlier years, develops mathematical programming model building and solution techniques, and is supported by mandatory readings and supervised discussion sessions. These supervised sessions aim at discussing how to put into practice the concepts and methods presented in the lectures and learned from the mandatory readings and the term projects. In addition, these sessions also serve as advice/support sessions so that students can seek feedback on their term projects work-in-progress. The student experience requires active learning and engagement, which requires students to read relevant chapters in the textbooks and other sources before attending classes. Students are required to complete three group projects using GAMS. Besides attending lectures and supervised discussion sessions (both of which are compulsory), students will work in groups on realistic projects (groups will be formed by the lecturer to reflect a heterogeneity of skills required for the projects) and present their work in class to an audience that may include practitioners and term project providers. Guest speakers might be invited for the benefit of students, however, students should not expect any hand-outs from the guests.",

In particular, the course aims to develop your ability to critically understand and evaluate issues such as:- Mergers, Acquisitions, and Corporate Restructuring activities, the role of the business cycle in the economy and also the stock market development, in causing Mergers, Acquisitions, and Corporate Restructuring activities.- Regulatory and strategic considerations, takeover tactics, and takeover defences.- Motives for Mergers, Acquisitions, and Corporate Restructuring.- Target firm and foreign target firm valuation.- Issues developed through information economics that contribute on the negotiation and re-negotiation stage of corporate reforms such as M&As and divestitures.- Empirical tests on the performance of merging and divesting firms at both the announcement- and the post-merger or integration period.- Cross-border (cross-industry) acquisitions and their main differences with domestic (focused) ones.The course relies on knowledge acquired from the Introduction to Corporate Finance or Principles of Finance courses in year 2 and covers the most recent developments from theoretical and empirical perspectives of Mergers, Acquisitions, and Corporate Restructuring.Outline ContentThe course will cover the following over ten two-hour sessions- Introduction and overview of Mergers, Acquisitions, and Corporate Restructuring Activities, waves, and their theoretical perspectives.-  Mergers, Acquisitions, and Divestitures strategies - Motives, implications, and alternative perspectives.- Target (foreign target) and divesting firm valuation.- Valuation of synergies.-  Structuring corporate reforms and negotiations - Paying for the target firm & the investment banker perspectives.- Value creation from M&As and Divestitures - Methods and evidence.Student Learning ExperienceYou will have to read the core textbooks that will support the learning outcomes of each topic/lecture, and also most of the additional references/readings that will accompany each topic. The weekly lectures will explore particular aspects of the course and the additional readings will attempt to help you put material in context, which will not substitute the core reading.During lectures you will be asked to be active, completing exercises and discussing issues with your fellow students. In any case, the nature of the material means that in most cases there is not a single acceptable answer. The important aspect is that you are able to argue on a case and present compelling evidence to back your argument.",

    "summary": "This course addresses an area where many resource allocation decisions depend not on the outcome of market forces but on the interplay of bargaining between two or more groups. Such situations may be found in purchasing a car, a carpet, or a house; in contracting for the services of a painter, a builder, or a plumber;  in determining the terms and conditions of one's individual employment;  in corporate take-overs;  in union-management agreements concerning groups of workers;  in free trade agreements within groups of countries;  in divorce settlements;  in setting regulatory conditions;  in determining the location of an environmentally dangerous facility;  and in many other areas of resource allocation.",
    "course_description": "Some of the important considerations that bear on such situations have long been understood in economics, e.g. the concept of reservation price. Others are only now being addressed. These new developments principally concern game theory and can be traced back to the work of Thomas Schelling as summarised in his The Strategy of Conflict. More recent examples of this line of work can be found in Avinash Dixit and Barry Nalebuff's Thinking Strategically. It has to be emphasised that this is not a course in game theory and does not pursue the theoretical approach. The approach we will adopt here is more behavioural and applied.This course attempts to recognise that the proper understanding of negotiation requires we go beyond the traditional boundaries of economics and management science, and address notions of bounded rationality, biases in decision making, social influence etc. What is outlined here is not a course in game theory.  This course will place much greater emphasis on bounded rationality.   It will also make extensive use of role playing and group based simulations. There will, therefore, be a substantial \"practical\" component to the teaching.Outline Content1.\tDetermining price and value; BATNA; zone of agreement; focal point; the canonical distributive bargaining case.2.\tPerceptions and biases; framing; anchoring; escalation.3.  \tStrategic behaviour - two parties; commitment; integrative versus distributive negotiation.4.\tStrategic behaviour - more than two issues; more than two parties; coalitions.5.\tBargaining over positions versus principles.6.\tThird parties; facilitators, mediators, arbitrators and rule manipulators; negotiating via information technology.7.\tNegotiation in the Shadow of the Law.8.\tStrikes.9.\tEnvironmental conflict resolution.10.\tEthics of negotiation; fairness; lies versus 'strategic misrepresentations'.11.\tNegotiation and culture; Body Language.12. \tElectronic NegotiationStudent Learning ExperienceNegotiation cases and simulations form an important part of the course. In each case you will be asked to sign-up for a particular role in a case, e.g. the buyer of a used car.  You will then be assigned to a \"team\", e.g. matched up with the seller of a used car.   Each team will have a physical area in which they can negotiate in privacy. Sometimes the lecture theatre itself will suffice. At other times you will be free to break out into other spaces. Combining these exercises with a coffee break is fine (and, indeed, we shall see that social interaction plays an important part in negotiation), but please maintain your focus on the exercise at hand and return to the lecture theatre by the deadline set. Late returns to class will miss the all-important 'de-briefing' component of the learning exercise.Even more so than in other courses, attendance is essential.   As an important part of learning in this course comes through the role playing exercises you are strongly advised to attend all teaching and learning sessions.  Any student who, for whatever reason, fails to attend three or more of the teaching and learning sessions is advised to drop the course in favour of some alternative.",

It is designed to provide an overview of an exciting and emerging area in finance which argues that investment decision-making and investor behaviour are not necessarily driven by rational agents and considerations but by aspects of personal and market psychology. Behavioural finance posits that biases and errors of judgment, to which all of us are prone, limit our ability to make sound financial decisions.This course introduces cognitive biases and heuristics, discusses the impact of such biases on the financial decision-making, and explores the behaviour of individual investors, professional investors and corporate managers.",
    "course_description": "The course is intended to complement other finance courses that are mainly based on the traditional paradigm assuming investors and managers are generally rational. It aims to examine how the insights of behavioural finance theories shed light on the behaviour of individual investors as well as finance professionals in investment decision-making and corporate financial decision-making. It also explores the possibility to improve investment and corporate performance by recognising the cognitive biases and applying appropriate debiasing techniques.Planned list of topics include:1. Introduction to psychology of finance2. Fundamental theories of investment psychology3. Investment biases and heuristics (part 1)4. Investment biases and heuristics (part 2)5. Behavioural portfolio management6. Emotions in finance7. Social interactions in finance8. Neuro-finance9. Asset price bubbles10.

Focusing on themes such as co-production, service leadership and service competition, the course will familiarise students with current academic theories, while frequent guest speakers will emphasise how these are applied in practice across the private, public and Third sector and across developed and emerging countries. With over 75% of employment in the service sector, the course is an essential asset for anyone planning a career in service industries, with relevance for consulting, retail, healthcare, hospitality, the arts, or financial services. The course also introduces the role of services in development, drawing from truly global case studies.",
    "course_description": "This course will explore the nature of services management and the distinctive challenges that it poses both for managers in this sector and for management theory. The sector (comprising both private and public sector services) covers such industries as finance and banking, accounting, consultancy, the arts and the media, retail, utilities, health-care and public services, tourism and hospitality, and leisure. It now comprises around 75% of employment in the developed world and 35-50% (and increasing quickly) in the developing world. Additionally 'service' has also been a key element of the profit equation for manufacturing firms. This makes understanding the nature of the service sector and the distinctive nature of its challenges essential for newly qualified graduates if they are going to have a strong position in the employment market. Moreover, service management presents distinctive challenges that contest much traditional management theory and provide an exciting new perspective on it for students. In the contemporary world, an understanding of service management is vital for the well-rounded management graduate.This course will enable students to understand the distinctive nature of services management and of value creation in service delivery, to consider the key challenges for service managers in the sector and the skills that they require to address them, and to explore a range of approaches to successful service management for service businesses. It will directly address the employability of our undergraduates in this vital sector of national and global economies and equip them with the knowledge to function as effective managers in these sectors. This will be achieved by a mix of lecture inputs, visiting speakers, case study and experiential exercises, and course assessment intended to focus the student on applying service management theories and techniques to the real world.Topics to be covered will include the nature of the service sector and its role in national and global economies, the co-creation of value in service delivery,  co-production and the role of the consumer in service delivery, designing effective services, strategic and marketing management in service businesses, the role of service staff in the service encounter, the impact of digital technology on service delivery, and evaluating quality and performance in service delivery.",

    "summary": "Power and politics are central to understanding the delivery of strategy. This course adopts a power and politics perspective from Organisation and Management theory to examine the strategy process. The course outlines critical theories of power, asking why some things happen while other issues are kept off the agenda and how change occurs.  A unique feature of this strategy course is its focus on organised politics, politicians and government practice. This context yields rich insights for studying strategy, and many strategic techniques developed in politics travel into the corporate world. It also helps us understand the pressures of high-profile leadership that is time-bound.The course focuses on political leaders, their teams and their approach to strategy. Participants will gain a comprehensive understanding of political strategy by analysing political leadership, election campaigns, governing, dealing with crises, and running the economy. The course emphasises the lifecycle of political careers and governments, highlighting how power is created and diminished.This course offers a unique insight for participants keen to learn more about how government and politics work from a strategic perspective. More generally, insights from the course will help furnish participants with a broader perspective on strategy and leadership.",
    "course_description": "We begin the course by exploring prominent theories of power and politics from within Management & Organisation Theory. We will follow a lifecycle approach, commencing with a political leader seeking power and concluding with their departure from office. The rationale for this is to understand the temporal dynamics of strategy, rather than being restricted to the here and now. Our analysis of political leaders will concentrate on their leadership style and how they create their teams around them, a crucial skill in any organisational context. We examine the political styles of leaders such as Gordon Brown, Barack Obama and Nicola Sturgeon. We will explore election campaigns and focus specifically on the strategic narratives employed. We will examine offensive and defensive campaigns used in elections, the role of opinion polls, dividing lines and strategic communications. The course will study the 2024 UK General Election and the 2024 US Presidential contest. Additionally, we will analyse the 2016 Brexit Referendum.Why do some political leaders succeed while others fail? Why do some strategies achieve their objectives while others fail? The course will engage critically with these questions. These insights transcend politics and apply to many organisations, across the corporate world. Although the primary objective of politics is to seize power, governing is challenging and often ends in failure. We will examine the common problems governments face in achieving their objectives.Additionally, we will analyse how governments respond to crises, such as the 2008 Financial Crisis and the 2020/21 Covid pandemic.The relationship between a government, its Financial Ministry / Treasury, and the money markets is crucial. This relationship is examined by looking at approaches taken by different Chancellors / Finance Ministers.While the majority of this course focuses on mainstream, centrist politics, we will also delve into the role of single issues and populist movements in politics. We assess the influence of the Green Movement on Net Zero policies and of UKIP on the UK's relationship with Europe. The media plays a vital role in the political process, and we will study how the news cycle and agenda work. The course concludes with an analysis of leaders leaving office and the nature of their legacy.Outline content1. Introduction to the Course: Organisations, Power and Politics.2. Political Leaders: The Making of Effective Leaders.3. Getting Elected: Inside Election Campaigns.4. In Power: The Art of the Possible.5.

    "course_description": "We will consider market policy in relation to decisions as to whether to pursue a strategy of product differentiation or cost reduction, and whether these are indeed mutually exclusive approaches.  We discuss issues of sustainability of profits, and policies towards innovation.  We then discuss such decisions as whether to make or buy inputs or channels of distribution. These issues are shown to depend critically on Transactions Costs, and following that line we examine the reward structure in the company.  Having looked at the decisions relating to the component units of the corporation, we then round off the course by analysing strategic interactions between firms. Throughout the course, the issues of managerial interests and the conflict with shareholders' interests and the implied information asymmetry and reputation concern provide an underlying theme.Outline Content1. Basic Economic Principle and Competitive Advantage2. Creating and Sustaining Competitive Advantage3. Strategic Interactions between Firms4. Innovation5. Agency Problems and Incentive Design6. Vertical Boundaries: Transaction costs and Vertical IntegrationStudent Learning ExperienceMuch of the student's learning will be achieved through reading and classroom activities. The reading list specifies the most important and less important items. For each topic on the reading list, a question is specified which helps students to focus their thoughts whilst carrying out the reading. Also, each topic contains at least one classroom activity, in which students have the chance to practice the theories that they learn from lectures and reading.Classroom activities are designed to promote more student engagement and are closely related to Lectures. Lectures provide a detailed synthesis of the literature with illustrative examples.

    "summary": "This course will introduce you to contemporary changes in the world of work by interrogating how the intervention of technology has changed the meaning of work, what new forms of work have emerged as a consequence of this intervention, and what the economic, social and ethical implications of these are.",
    "course_description": "Over the past decade or so, there has been a resurgence of public discourse and policy debate on the 'future of work'. This conversation tends to revolve around the subject of technology. Indeed, technology is gaining increasing significance in the study and teaching of business and management. While much of this work has focused on how technology shapes and fulfils organisational, business and market imperatives, there is increasing interest in examining how workers/employees, and society at large, experience and respond to technological changes. This latter intervention aims to conceptualise the future of work more broadly by interrogating how technology has impacted the meaning of work, i.e. what counts as work/what we do for work, and employment relations on a global scale.Accordingly, this course aims to unpack the future of work beyond its technology-driven reconfigurations by engaging with the social and ethical transformations unfolding in the world of work. This is of particular importance to prevent the perpetuation of cultural blind-spots in the eager push for technological advancement. In particular, the proposed course will demonstrate how technology changes the experience and possibilities for work, and hence of life chances, along lines of social and global inequalities of race, gender, ability and class. It will thus help demonstrate the differential social and global impacts of technology in work.Overall, the course will provide tools for intelligent and meaningful engagement with technology in the context of work as well as for the critical evaluation of yourselves as social agents in the wider world.I. Framework: Theories and Concepts1. Introduction to the Future of Work2. Contemplating the meaning of Technology3. Contemplating the meaning of WorkII. Contemporary Issues: A socio-ethical review4. The intelligence economy5. The surveillance economy6. The consumer economy7. The digital economyIII. Conclusion8. Decolonising the Future of WorkStudent Learning Experience:Pedagogy: This course will be delivered mainly through interactive lectures wherein active participation (listening and questioning) is highly encouraged. The approach to teaching undertaken in this course will not entail the mere delivery of information. Rather it follows from an of understanding of knowledge as co-created based on a critically-informed intersection of facts, experience, method.This course will model the following pedagogic view:- Knowledge is still contextual and relative, uncertain and tentative, yet it is possible to take positions, make choices, commit oneself.- The instructor is someone who is fully aware of uncertainty yet has the courage to make commitments.- Teaching is challenging and encouraging students to explore complexities fully and then to take a stand.- Students seek understanding of complexities not just as academic pursuit but also in order to create a world view, one from which they will make commitments and choices.(adapted from: https://pages.uoregon.edu/munno/Learning/Stages.html)Learning: It is important to note that this is an honours level course. It is not intended merely to give you tools and templates of practice. Instead, it aims to help you increase the depth and breadth of your knowledge and understanding of a given subject so that you may then improve your practice.Consequently, the readings for this course are intended to help you to challenge the information and knowledge you possess, and your way of thinking about things. This does not, however, mean that the readings are inaccessible. It simply means that you need to give yourself the space and time to read, and to think as you read.",

This course will equip you with the conceptual and practical knowledge for understanding and managing digital transformation. It will engage you through an evidence-based approach, drawing on the latest research and case studies. It will help you analyse the strategic and managerial complexities of digital transformation by linking digital technology, business expansion and strategy. You will reflect on current technological, strategic and organizational changes that affect enterprises and public services, mature or start-ups alike. During the course, you will debate on how best navigate the digital world, and work on multiple case studies to design real-world solutions to problems.",
    "course_description": "Strategy is turning digital! Digital technologies greatly impact on competition and the way business is done. The route towards digitization is fraught with great risks and presents the scope for major mistakes, which firms make time after time. On this course, you will learn and understand those risks and discover how they are best overcome. The first part of the course will be devoted to acquire the conceptual and methodological background for understanding digital transformation. The second part of the course will focus on business opportunities arising from digital technologies, and how managers can grasp these along the way. By mobilizing the latest research in managerial economics, organization studies and strategic change, the course will provide you with solid frameworks of analysis.  It will engage you through an evidence-based approach, building on research published in Harvard Business Review, Organization Science, and other leading management journals. Furthermore, you will work on numerous up-to-date examples, case studies and exercises that cover different topics. The course will encourage you to build bridges between conceptual frameworks and the contemporary digital world. During the course, you will design solutions to some of the greatest challenges associated with the strategy of digital transformation, based on case studies and hands-on exercises.By the end of the course, you will be aware of important concepts and theoretical frameworks that are relevant for managers and organizations seeking to embrace digital transformation successfully and responsibly.Note: This content is indicative and subject to updates to reflect current developments.Section 1 - Imagining digital transformation- The underlying ideology of the 'digital': Internet philosophy and the libertarian roots of digital technologies- The underlying economics of digital transformation: the network effect, the chicken and egg problem, traffic monetization.- The underlying lure of technology: web3, AI, cryptocurrencies, 3D printing.Section 2 - Designing the strategy of digital transformation- Platform business: designing, funding and scaling up a platform- Digital transformation in public services: saving costs or creating value for the users?- Digital business for mature companies: the challenge of 'we have always done it this way'Section 3 - Leading strategically Digital Transformation- Leading responsibly: the ethical and moral aspects of digital transformation- From the webpage corporation to blockchains: organizational challenges of web3- Internationalizing digital transformation: pitfalls and how to overcome them- Leadership in the age of the digital: how to divide labour between managers, consultants, staff, and machines.The course adopts a flipped classroom method, which means that students are expected to prepare the material before each lecture. Lectures will be devoted to the discussions of the main concepts, frameworks, exercises and application to real-world cases. The number of slides will be kept to a minimum, as the lecture will develop along with the discussions taking place in the classroom. Notes are taken 'live' during the discussions, and inputs emerge from the discussions themselves. Therefore, students will take an active role in the way the course unfolds, not only through their preparation of each session, but also through their active participation. The capacity to use the acquired conceptual frameworks in a managerially relevant way will be evidenced through the writing of a short blog post and the realization of a video on a chosen topic in relation to the course.",

This means that we will study persuasion as a craft learned through exemplars and by means of practice. For our theories, we look towards philosophical accounts of rhetoric. For our techniques, we looks towards psychological models. For our practice, we produce copy.We begin with a consideration of rhetorical situations: what they are and how we should negotiate them. This first half of the course brings us into contact with old ideas that remain applicable, as we shall see, to contemporary situations. We pay special attention here to the enduring critique of rhetoric, as developed by Plato, as well as to the alternative representation of rhetoric as a craft that we have inherited from Aristotle. With these foundations set by means of old theories and recent examples, we then proceed, in the second half of the course, towards a consideration of the challenges that define the application of psychological insights to the craft of persuasion.Outline ContentPART ONE: Theories of Persuasion1.\tIntroduction- The Advantages and Disadvantages of Persuasion Today2.\tPersuasion as Deception- The Endurance of the Platonic Critique I3.\tPersuasion as Manipulation- The Endurance of the Platonic Critique II4.\tPersuasion in Public Life I- Aristotle, with and Against Plato5.\tPersuasion in Public Life II- Machiavelli, with and Against AristotlePART TWO: Techniques of Persuasion6.\tPsychoanalytic Persuasion- Affecting the Unconscious, Producing Propaganda7.\tCognitive Persuasion- Mapping the Decision, Measuring the Process8.\tCommunicative Persuasion- Changing the Frame, Flattering the Audience9.\tBehavioural Persuasion- Managing the Platform, Automating the Context10.\tConclusion- The Advantages and Disadvantages of Persuasion Today IIStudent Learning ExperienceStudents will be required to undertake a series of assigned listening, watching and reading tasks in advance of each session.

    "summary": "Finance theory and practice has been developed in the context of public equity markets. Venture capital (VC) and private equity (PE) investments play a key role in generating transformative societal impact, driving disruptive innovation and economic growth as traditional finance cannot provide capital for such (risky) ventures. The industry merits special consideration not only because of its scale but also because of the unique characteristics of the market compared to other sources of equity financing. The private market and its investment process operate in a distinctly different manner to public markets. The course is designed to critically evaluate the venture capital and private equity markets through a prism of finance theory. The course therefore emphasises the fundamental need to identify, discuss, critically evaluate and synthesize the developing theories, frameworks and models, both quantitative and qualitative, which are used in explaining financial intermediation in the field of private markets and venture capital.",
    "course_description": "Honours Venture Capital and Private Equity considers aspects of the financing and governance of portfolio companies and VC/PE funds believed to be of academic interest and practical importance. The aims are to introduce students to current thinking and empirical research on the chosen topics, and to develop skills of understanding, analysis and explanation. The course builds on the finance and accounting learned earlier in the degree programme, and so it assumes some knowledge of companies and financial reporting.The objective is to move beyond a descriptive account of the mechanics of the private equity and venture capital industry (though this is important given the unique organisation and contract structures of the market) so that students gain a more complete understanding of why and how the industry operates as it does. These questions can be answered best through the prism of finance theory. We shall identify and discuss the critical stages in the engagement between entrepreneurs soliciting investment, and the VC/PE firms that select, invest in, nurture, and often refinance fast growing new companies or later-stage ventures. Valuations and performance metrics in venture capital and private equity will be examined in detail too.Tutorial/seminar hours represent the minimum total live hours a student can expect to receive on this course. These hours may be delivered in tutorial/seminar, lecture, workshop or other interactive whole class or small group format. In each lecture, an overview of the topic is presented and several papers are reviewed in some detail, to give insight into the current state of research on the topic. In seminars, we will discuss case studies and specific questions relating to papers on the reading list.",

    "summary": "Digital technologies greatly impact competition and the way business is done. The route towards digitisation is fraught with great risks and presents the scope for major mistakes, which firms make time after time. On this course you will learn and understand those risks and discover how they are best overcome.",
    "course_description": "Academic description:The first part of the course will be devoted to acquire the conceptual and methodological background for understanding digital business transformation. The second part of the course will focus on business opportunities arising from digital technologies, and how to build, and capitalise on, new digital capabilities. By mobilising the latest research in managerial economics, organisation studies and business strategy, the course will provide you with solid frameworks of analysis. The course will engage you through an evidence-based approach, building on research published in Strategic Management Journal, Harvard Business Review, Administrative Science Quarterly and other leading management journals. Furthermore, you will work on numerous up-to-date examples, case studies and exercises that cover different topics. This work will not only encourage you to build bridges between theoretical frameworks and the contemporary world of business, but also encourage you to make parallels with your own business experience.Outline content:During the course, you will design solutions to some of the greatest challenges associated with digital business transformation, based on guest presentations by managers who have been driving, or are currently implementing, the digital transformation of their business. Equipped with the knowledge and experience acquired during the first and second parts of the course, you will propose an analysis of the risks and opportunities, and deliver recommendations as how difficulties can be overcome.  By the end of the course, you will be aware of important concepts and theoretical frameworks that are relevant for managers and firms seeking to embrace digital transformation successfully.Student learning experience:The course adopts a flipped classroom method, which means that students are expected to prepare the material before each lecture. Lectures will be devoted to the discussions of the main concepts, frameworks, exercises and application to real-world cases. The number of slides will be kept to a minimum, as the lecture will develop along with the discussions taking place in the classroom. Notes are taken 'live' during the discussions, and inputs emerge from the discussions themselves. Therefore, students will take an active role in the way the course unfolds, not only through their preparation of each session, but also through their active participation. The capacity to use the acquired conceptual frameworks in a managerially relevant way will be evidenced through the writing of a report. The knowledge and understanding of the content of the course will be assessed through an individual test.",

This module covers organisational design and development. The course will enable students to develop a critical understanding of organisational change via the theories and conceptual frameworks of organisation design and the principles and practices of organisational development. Both are critical to our understanding of organisations and how they function and both reside within a framework of organisation theory.Outline content:The course focuses on decisions that have to be made on the most appropriate organisational structure(s) to ensure dynamic delivery of organisational activities.Organisation design is about shaping an organisation to maximise its effectiveness; aiming for flexibility in delivery of its services. Through breaking down departmental barriers, seeking improved supply efficiencies, teamwork and collaboration and working towards better customer management and retention, organisations can enhance their performance and ensure that organisational goals and targets are achieved. Organisation design activities therefore focus on finding the most appropriate structures, relationships between departments and sections, and allocation of work activities, including definition of duties and role responsibilities. The module also focuses on how an organisation's culture, values and environment support and enhance organisational performance and adaptability.Organisation development can be defined as a 'planned and systematic approach to enabling sustained organisation performance through the involvement of its people'. This might include how organisational members acquire new skills, knowledge and behaviours, and do things differently, often as part of the application of continuous improvement strategies. The concept of the 'learning organisation' as one of a number of organisation development strategies that might be adopted as part organisational change activities is also explored.Student learning experience:Achievement of learning outcomes will be demonstrated through class participation and understanding, and through completion of the individual assessment.",

    "course_description": "Academic description:Traditional research in business analytics focused on the decision theoretic perspectives, in which a single decision-making authority optimises the system as a whole under exogenous uncertainty. The past decades saw the evolution of business studies to address management problems with strategic uncertainty, in which different individuals, divisions and/or firms strategically interact with each other. Strategic interactions in multi-agent problems create new challenges for managers. As a natural quantitative analytical tool for such multi-agent decision making problems, game theory has widely and successfully been applied to the field of business management.Outline content:This course introduces game theory as analytical tools and provides insights into managerial situations in order to assist with decision making when multiple agents with conflicting objectives are involved. To be more specific, it provide students with both cooperative and non-cooperative game theory based quantitative frameworks to analyse strategic interactions in economic problems and its impact on managerial decision making and to understand strategic situations in which different individuals/divisions/firms may have potentially conflicting incentives.Student learning experience:Students will embark on an insightful journey to understand the strategic interactions among rational decision-makers in business scenarios. Through a blend of theoretical foundations and interactive simulations, learners will explore key concepts such as Nash Equilibrium, sequential games, and cooperative versus non-cooperative strategies. This course equips students with the analytical tools and frameworks to anticipate competitor actions, optimize business decisions, and craft strategies that can transform challenges into competitive advantages in the complex world of business.",

    "summary": "There is growing interest in understanding how social innovation - about new approaches that are neither market, government nor traditional charitable approaches to enduring problems of social exclusion - which is arguably a major contributing factor to many of our most pressing social and environmental problems. These new approaches include 3rd sector organisations (social enterprises, low-profit corporations, co-operatives, community interest corporations, benefit corporations and other forms) and hybrid networks of government, industry, and 3rd sector organisations. Responding to these social and environmental challenges, requires an understanding of the underlying causes of these problems and how designing and implementing solutions can pose specific challenges in terms of organisational design, management, oversight, and feedback. This course seeks to provide students with greater insight into those challenges through a critical re-evaluation of environmental challenges, social issues and case studies of innovative responses.",
    "course_description": "Academic description:Social innovation - new approaches that are neither market, government nor traditional charitable approaches to enduring problems of social exclusion - are increasingly relied upon as catalysts for addressing difficult social and environmental issues. The aim of this course is to develop student knowledge and understanding about the organising challenges faced by organisations and social entrepreneurs that engage in the work of social innovation. In this course, students will gain a broader and deeper theoretical and contextual understanding of current and future opportunities and challenges in the field of social impact by drawing upon a range of concepts including complexity theory, systems thinking, strategy, and governance. Through theoretical and case-based work, students will develop transferable skills directly applicable to 3rd sector, government and private organisations engaged in social innovation initiatives.Outline content:1. Why social innovation? The history and context of the role of 3rd sector organisations and social innovation in building and reinforcing civil society and democratic norms. What are the current and future trends within the 3rd sector?2. Assessing social impact. How can we measure ideas such as social capital and social impact? What are the implications of how we measure and how we frame these issues for communicating with crucial stakeholders.3. Complex systems and systems thinking. Social problems are invariably embedded in complex systems. Developing effective responses requires an understanding of this complexity through conceptual tools such as systems thinking and how problems such as environmental damage and social inequality are outcomes of dysfunctional systems.4. Governance. These are structures and processes that determine Â¿who decidesÂ¿. The value of a governance perspective is an understanding that responsible decisions and behaviour depends as much or more on a system that incentivises responsibility, than the virtue of individuals themselves.Student learning experience:In this course, you will develop an understanding of concepts such as complex adaptive systems, systems thinking, and risk to gain an appreciation for and knowledge of the role of organizational structures and governance processes for improving overall efficiency, sustainability, and impact in private, public, and 3rd sector organizations. Your will take in this ambitiously broad ranging content through a series of podcasts for onboarding prior to lectures, and then in workshop lectures where we will engage conceptual and practical case study discussions to deepen your understanding of these issues, their application, and their underlying connections and relations.",

However, in the digital economy the complex networks of people, artefacts and bots that feedback data allow for the co-creation of new forms of value. These dynamic relationships can be described not as value chains, but as value constellations.

Lectures will establish a basis for understanding core concepts in the co-creation of value, including how value is informed through values, historical models of how value is created toward products and services within value chains, toward the more contemporary concept of value constellations, students will be introduced to methods toward the analysis and mapping of value in data value constellations. The course will reflect upon the emergence of contemporary economic models in the digital economy through case studies, and use workshops to develop student proposals for new models. Students will be supported to map value constellations and in turn develop products and services that co-create value.This course will:1. Extend student understanding of historical and contemporary concepts of value creation and the association of values.2. Develop methods in the mapping of value constellations from existing contexts, that lead to the development of new value constellations to support new products and systems.3. Develop student skills in the design of new economic models for the digital economy.",

Involvement in these early workshops will establish the skills sets for the development of a significant piece of individual coursework that responds to the themes within the course.This course will address the following themes:1. Mapping the impact of digital and data-driven technology on society and our sense of what it means to be human2. Data-driven paradigms for governance, decision-making, the digital economy and technological interventions in cognition and selfhood3. Critical perspectives on data-driven society4.

    "summary": "The Management Honours Dissertation is taken in the 4th year of study and is part of the core courses in Business Studies and related degrees. It is a requirement for students aiming to graduate with an MA from the University of Edinburgh.It is an independent research project which culminates in the production of a ~15,000 word document, commonly split into the following chapters: Introduction; Literature Review; Methodology/Research Design; Results/Findings; and Conclusion.",
    "course_description": "The dissertation is a 40 credit course (equivalent to 2 full courses at Honours) and equates to one-sixth of the total Honours assessment taken over both the Honours years (6 courses in 3rd Year and 4 courses plus the dissertation in 4th Year). For the MA Honours in International Business or MA Honours in International Business with a Language, the dissertation ranks as one-third of the total assessment.It is the most independent component of the Business School's undergraduate degree programme as it requires students, supported by their Dissertation Advisor, to identify and define a research topic, conduct the research and report on findings in a substantial piece of academic writing, all within a predetermined schedule of nearly 12 months.Undertaking the dissertation allows you to develop a deep level of analysis and understanding of the theory and processes of organisations, markets, and the business environment through the completion of a piece of individual research.Student Learning Experience:The dissertation provides an opportunity for students to demonstrate their abilities in the graduate attributes that form part of the learning outcomes identified by the University of Edinburgh. In addition practical skills will be built in research and enquiry, personal and intellectual autonomy, communication and personal effectiveness.",

    "additional_class_delivery_information": "Contact HoursOver the course of the dissertation period, a student should expect a minimum of four meetings of variable length with their Dissertation Advisor. Depending on the degree programme involved, students will also have had 4-6 hours of dissertation preparation lectures in 3rd year and the following support sessions in 4th Year on reviewing literature and writing up.1)\tLiterature review2)\tResearch contribution3)\tResearch design and data collection4)\tWriting your methods5)\tAnalysis6)\tWriting a discussion7)\tWriting a conclusionNon-contact HoursAs the Management Honours Dissertation accounts for 40 credits (equivalent to two taught courses), and is a complex piece of work, students should expect to devote a considerable amount of time to it - working independently outside of contact hours. As per the Scottish Credit Qualifications Framework (SCQF), this means that it should entail approximately 400 hours of student effort. Successful completion requires considerable time devoted to researching the topic, gathering and analysing relevant data and writing up your study in the appropriate manner. Students should not underestimate the time required and the need to make an early start on reviewing the literature and undertaking your own research. In addition, if a student intends to use modes of enquiry with which he/she is not entirely familiar, he/she will need to spend time familiarising themselves with these. Writing up in an appropriate manner is also a lengthy process.It is, therefore, important for students to understand fully the need to 'front-load' their efforts as much as possible so as to allow plenty of time to complete the dissertation within the time allowed.",

Its objective is to provide the accounting and financial background desirable for any intending business manager, and an introduction to those analytical tools necessary to generate information for the managerial decision-making.  Specifically we focus on the following topics: the accounting process, basic financial statements and their interpretation and basic managerial decision-making techniques. The introductory nature of the course implies that it is very appropriate for students with no or minimum level of accounting knowledge and computation skills. Students with knowledge of accounting and/or financial management at intermediate levels or higher will not find the course suitable for their needs.",
    "course_description": "Accounting is described as the \"process of identifying, measuring and communicating economic information to permit informed judgements and decisions by users of the information\" (American Accounting Association). As described, accounting is involved with the generation of both financial and non-financial information that will be utilised by decision-makers to make good. Similarly, financial management is mainly about making decision relating to assets, liabilities, cash management, investing and financing activities.Together, accounting and related financial information are relevant to the decisions that organisations make with the resources they have as well as communicating the information to interested parties.This course aims to provide students with an understanding of the basic areas of accounting and related financial information to enable them to function as members of the management decision-making team in their organisation. The particular emphasis is on the application of techniques and interpretation of accounting information for decision-making.Outline Content1.

    "summary": "This course is focussed on teaching concepts, techniques and practices in the principal discipline within the financial controls function, that of accounting for managerial decision-making. In the management of a business within a competitive environment accounting for managerial decision-making fulfils a highly significant role and so this course is designed to teach the principles of management accounting within the strategic context.",
    "course_description": "The rise of the information age has brought a profound structural shift in the way value is generated by modern organizations and accounted for in economies and societies. In 1975, tangible assets accounted for more than 80 percent of the market value of the 500 largest US firms. By 2015 the situation was entirely inverted, with nearly 90 percent of market capitalization deriving from intangible assets. Accordingly, accounting for value is no longer solely driven by fixed physical and financial assets, but instead by more fluid resources, such as relationships, networks, intellectual, social and human capital. This transformational trend has called into question the relevance of many traditional accounting and reporting tools. Addressing these challenges entails the need to introduce accounting models that embrace and tackle these issues to account for a richer and more dynamic concept of value. This module introduces and critical evaluates such accounting tools for decision-making.Outline Content:Introduction to accounting: complexities and evolving trendsThe design of budgeting systemsCost-volume profit analysis and decision-makingCosting in complex and fast changing environmentsBalanced Scorecard: Strategy execution and performance management",

This course is suitable for students seeking careers in investment management who want to achieve a better understanding of the environmental and social portfolio risks and opportunities. It can be equally of interest to all students working for organization (permanent or temporary) subject to investment pressures with regards to their ESG footprint.The course will provide a common lecture series and will focus on four key areas:- Decision making under competing economic, environmental, social priorities/pressures- Trends and standards in ESG measurement and reporting- The history of ESG integration in investments.- Current practices in ESG integration in investmentsNew forms of sustainable finance such as impact investment, social impact bonds, peer to peer financing and diverse crowd-based approaches to investments.This course can contribute to the reflections central to programme management with regards to environmental and social impact of business operations, how reporting on them is conducted and how investors consider these factors in investment processes and engagements with their portfolio companies.",
    "course_description": "The course starts off by a reflection on ethical decision making when dealing with competing economic, social, environmental and governance priorities/pressures. It will then shift its focus to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) analysis, the challenges of converting complex social and environmental issues into numbers and of comparing such numbers across different entities. We will then delve into the politics of ESG reporting standards and the current trends in their uptake.In the second part of the course, we will discuss the institutional structure of the investments field, identifying different types of actors including both asset owners and asset managers and how they engage with ESG matters. We will then detail how investors use their capital to pressure their investees for adjustments in their ESG behaviour through diverse practices framed as shareholder engagement. We will wrap up the course with discussions about new forms of finance and their potentials for positive ESG impact ranging from blockchain to peer to peer / decentralized modes of financing and social impact bonds.The lecture series will focus on the following areas:1. Ethical decision making when facing competing Economic, Environmental, Social and Governance priorities.2. Introduction to Environmental and Social Reporting3 Overview of portfolio environmental and social risks4. Engagements aimed at improving environmental and social risk management5. New forms of Finance between democratization of finance and financialization of public goods6.

It has various applications including passenger and freight transportation, telecommunications, utilities, supply chain etc. In traditional approaches to network design, it is often assumed that supply is always available and the amount of demand is known and fixed. In real life however, demand could vary significantly and supply might be disrupted for variety of reasons. This course aim at providing students with the background needed to understand and analyse network operations in normal and under e.g., stochastic demand, congestion and random disruptions. It will introduce strategic, tactical and operational decisions in network design and explores how these decisions are sensitive to possibility of disruption and demand variation. In this course, different approaches to network resilience and robustness will also be discussed.Outline Content: This course consists of 5 lectures.(Lecture 1) introduction to networks(Lecture 2) network design and applications(Lecture 3) network congestion and disruption(Lecture 4) network reliability, robustness and resilience(Lecture 5) solutions to network reliabilityStudent Learning ExperienceStudents are expected to learn basic concepts and theories from 5 two-hour lectures for 5 weeks.

    "summary": "This course is designed to provide an overview of an exciting new and fast growing area in finance, which takes as its premise that investment decision-making and investor behaviour are not necessarily driven by 'rational' considerations but by aspects of personal and market psychology. Behavioural finance recognises that our abilities to make complex financial decisions are limited due to the biases and errors of judgement to which all of us are prone. This course introduces cognitive biases, discusses the impact of such biases on the financial decision-making, and explores the behaviour of individual investors, fund managers and corporate managers.",
    "course_description": "This course is intended to complement other finance courses that are mainly based on the traditional paradigm which assumes that investors and managers are generally rational. Specifically, this course has two main objectives. First, we aim to examine how the insights of behavioural finance theories shed light on the behaviour of individual investors and finance professionals in investment decision-making and corporate financial decision-making. Second, we explore the possibility to improve investment performance and corporate performance by recognising the cognitive biases and applying appropriate 'debiasing' techniques.Outline ContentTopics covered in this course include cognitive biases and heuristics, prospect theory, mental accounting, social interaction, and emotions and investment decisions.Student Learning ExperienceThe learning occurs primarily through reading and thinking about the papers or chapters of books recommended and discussion in class. This reading is supported by the classes, in each of which an overview of the topic is presented and the findings of a number of relevant papers are reviewed in some detail.Learning takes place in three stages. Prior to each session you are required to complete the reading assignments given. During the session, the lecture slides will be used to focus the discussion and to help to summarise key issues. As the structure of the elective is designed to be cumulative, you will be expected to bring your learning and insights from previous sessions to bear on subsequent sessions.Tutorial/seminar hours represent the minimum total live hours (online or in-person) a student can expect to receive on this course.

It requires no background knowledge and is specifically tailored to the novice's needs. Anyone with an interest in technology will greatly benefit from following this course.",
    "course_description": "This course aims to introduce students into the strategic potential and limitations of Blockchain technology to shape contemporary business models, markets and institutions. Despite the widespread interest and hype, Blockchain is still a nascent technology and a clear strategy for its successful implementation has not yet materialised. Without a critical understanding of the potential value Blockchain can generate and the feasibility of applying it, organisations will not generate benefits from its potential. Against this background, this course explores the following questions: how can organisations develop a strategic business case that justifies major investments in Blockchain technology? What are the risks that have to be taken into account in this process? What are potential future developments in the industry and in relation to policy-making?  The course explores these concerns with a focus on the potential strategic importance of Blockchain for specific sectors within the economy and society, and it draws from specific use-cases to assess what approaches are likely to generate value. The course will also offer broader reflections on the role of tech innovations in reshaping contemporary institutions and values within an increasingly digitised society. While participants will develop a strong understanding of the underlying concepts and driving forces of these questions, the course does not strictly focus on a granular and tech-focused exploration of Blockchain. Instead it develops the necessary skills of students to become competent decision-makers and analysts to guide strategy and policy.Outline ContentThe course is built out of the following topics:- An introduction to Blockchain technology, its evolution and its key building blocks and concepts.- Blockchain as a disruptor of existing business models, institutions and values- Limitations and frontiers of Blockchain- Critically developing a strategic business case for Blockchain- The policy environment for the technological innovations like Blockchain",

In addition, students will discuss and justify their research methods and write a reflective essay on how their experience aligns or diverges from the normal entrepreneurship process and the types of challenges and barriers they have encountered.Student Learning ExperienceThe capstone is an experiential learning project in which students will demonstrate their knowledge of the entrepreneurship process through doing. Students will develop a commercial or social venture idea and analyse its feasibility to become a profitable, self-sustaining venture. They will conduct primary research in the form of customer interviews, observations and surveys and secondary research by analysing market trends and other data. These data will be analysed through a rigorous methodology in order to validate aspects of the venture such as market size, pricing plans, and growth potential. They will develop plans for new products / services and design market entry strategies and where possible, test these plans with potential customers and users. They will present their plan in a logical and clear manner through both written arguments and visuals as needed.

There is an expectation that the project will be informed by an understanding of relevant literature and theoretical frameworks, but the emphasis is on the analysis of relevant information to resolve the clientÂ¿s issue or problem.Business Plan projectResearched, costed, completed plan for some sort of (new) venture including risk analysis. It is expected that the case for the venture will have been made. The plan looks at operationalising the venture.Early Stage Feasibility Study projectFocuses on a potential new venture. The Â¿ideaÂ¿ will already have been researched and formulated. The project will look to prove or disprove the feasibility of the venture, making next steps recommendations where applicable.Student Learning ExperienceStudents work individually on their Capstone Projects, but under the supervisory guidance of an experienced member of faculty.  Students are required to keep in regular contact with their Advisor. As a minimum they should meet with their Advisor three times.In particular, the following key meetings are required:Â¿\tA preliminary discussion of the studentÂ¿s proposal with the Advisor (this will cover, broadly, the feasibility of the idea; possible sources of data and reading; methods of analysis; a plan or timetable)Â¿\tAssessment of progress to date. This is most likely to be a short meeting to discuss data collection and to map out further progressÂ¿\tFinal meeting. In the latter part of the process, students may meet with their advisor to discuss the analysis or interpretation of data collected or to provide feedback on a sample chapter",

Students will come away from the course with the skills to both implement and critique carbon accounting methods.",
    "course_description": "The course provides an overview of the different forms of carbon accounting, and their different purposes, particularly their application to climate change finance. The conceptual distinction between 'attributional' and 'consequential' accounting methods will be used to analyse the nature and appropriate use of different methods.The course develops both practical knowledge for implementing different carbon accounting methods, and analytical skills for critiquing current accounting and reporting practice. We will explore the relationship between carbon accounting and carbon/climate finance, and the different information needs of different types of investor (e.g. impact investors and climate risk-conscious investors).The course complements the Carbon Pricing course, covering aspects of monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) for regulated entities within trading schemes. The course interfaces with the Climate Policy & Investment course, and the Climate Risk and Investment Alignment course, by exploring the estimation and allocation of carbon budgets consistent with a 1.5 or 2 degree global temperature change target. The course also complements the Mitigation Outcome Assessment option course by introducing methods for calculating changes in emissions, and the Climate Change & Capital Markets course by introducing portfolio carbon footprinting.Outline Content1.\tOverview of the different forms of carbon accounting and their different purposes2.\tLife cycle assessment3.\tCorporate-level carbon accounting4.\tPortfolio carbon footprinting5.\tCarbon auditing and validation6.\tCarbon accounting at the national and community level7.\tCarbon budgets and mitigation targets8.\tConsequential carbon accounting9.\tEthical issues associated with carbon accounting10.

The Carbon and Environmental Consulting Project is an interdisciplinary MSc course at the University of Edinburgh Business School, and challenges students to think about climate change in the context of organisations' current and future decision-making. Currently, businesses are largely seen as organisations that are impacted by climate change, rather than being important participants, and possibly leaders, in attaining a low carbon society. Students will learn to challenge this interpretation of organisations by gaining an in-depth understanding of the fundamental challenges that climate change and environmental-related issues pose to business current decision making.

    "course_description": "Organisations, their workforces, clients and customers face new internal and external contextual issues on a regular basis. This module covers organisational design and development. The course will enable students to develop a critical understanding of organisational change via the theories and conceptual frameworks of organisation design and the principles and practices of organisational development. Both are critical to our understanding of organisations and how they function and both reside within a framework of organisation theory. The course focuses on decisions that have to be made on the most appropriate organisational structure(s) to ensure dynamic delivery of organisational activities.Organisation design is about shaping an organisation to maximise its effectiveness; aiming for flexibility in delivery of its services. Through breaking down departmental barriers, seeking improved supply efficiencies, teamwork and collaboration and working towards better customer management and retention, organisations can enhance their performance and ensure that organisational goals and targets are achieved. Organisation design activities therefore focus on finding the most appropriate structures, relationships between departments and sections, and allocation of work activities, including definition of duties and role responsibilities. The module also focuses on how an organisation's culture, values and environment support and enhance organisational performance and adaptability.Organisation development can be defined as a 'planned and systematic approach to enabling sustained organisation performance through the involvement of its people'. This might include how organisational members acquire new skills, knowledge and behaviours, and do things differently, often as part of the application of continuous improvement strategies. The concept of the 'learning organisation' as one of a number of organisation development strategies that might be adopted as part organisational change activities is also explored.Student learning experienceAchievement of learning outcomes will be demonstrated through class participation and understanding, and through completion of the individual assessment.",

The course will also introduce students to the writing of 'policy briefs' - a critical tool and skill set needed for professionals working with the policy community.",
    "course_description": "The course aims to provide students with an understanding of the principal concepts upon which climate change policy is based. It will look at how the dominant theoretical approach used to understand climate change problem (i.e. as global common pool resources challenge) influences the framing of the policy problem as well as the type of frameworks and policy instruments used. The course will explore the connection between economy, society and greenhouse gas emissions to give students the knowledge and skills needed identify across all sectors how emissions can be reduced and resiliency increased. Finally, the course will focus on the connection between the policy choices made - and the investment environment that drives both the demand for investment and supply of capital across climate related infrastructure and economic value chains.The course develops the key concepts, critical understanding and hard skills for identifying what policy solutions are appropriate across countries, sectors and technologies as well as between mitigation and adaptation goals. Students will develop their abilities to construct convincing and precise arguments through a policy brief writing exercise that will take place in two stages across the course. Students will be provided with examples and applied case studies.The course will run in parallel to the Fundamentals of Project Finance and Carbon Accounting courses in the first half of Semester 1. It will complement these courses by providing the knowledge of fundamental concepts around climate change and the policy response. It will also provide insights and critical understanding that will then be built upon in the second half of Semester 1 in the Carbon Pricing and International Climate Finance courses that will each in turn go into more detail on specific areas of public policy, investment and finance. The course will also provide background knowledge that will be used in Semester 2, particularly in the Climate Change & Investment course.Outline Content1.\tOverview of the science of climate change2.\tThe connection between climate change and the real economy (both causes and impacts)3.\tIntroduction to climate policy, or the management of open access common pool resources4.\tThe types of policy mechanisms used to address climate change5.\tClimate Change and the international policy response (UNFCCC, international negotiations, the Paris Agreement)6.\tClimate Change policy at the national level7.\tThe scale of investment challenge and the need for both public and private investment and finance8.\tClimate change policy and the investment environmentStudent Learning ExperienceThe course will be taught through weekly lectures and will generally include a case study, group exercise or other interactive discussion component.

Students will develop the critical thinking skills to evaluate whether emerging practices are fit for purpose for use by different financial actors (banking, asset management, institutional investors) as well as for different mandates (impact-driven versus maximising financial returns).The course builds on the Carbon Accounting course, using concepts introduced in the first semester to assess the exposure to climate-related risks and/or the consistency with national and international climate goals. The course complements and applies in part the concepts from the Climate Policy & Investment and Carbon Pricing course as carbon pricing is one of the principal policies and drivers behind different forms of climate-related risks. It also builds upon the International Climate Finance course as it explores how mandated financial institutions, ie those seeking to have a positive contribution to achieving climate-related goals, integrate this into their decision making strategies.

No industry, no organisation is immune from the threat of being disrupted. With 40 per cent of jobs being replaced by digital technology over the next two decades, no individual is immune.Digital enabled transformation has become the number one challenge facing organisations today.

    "course_description": "This course considers the use of economics to help managers make decisions with regard to: cost and demand, pricing including optimal mark-ups and price discrimination; product differentiation or cost based strategies; strategy in relation to rival firms; the make or buy decision and vertical integration; diversification and the implications of mergers, and the sustainability of profits. There will be an emphasis on the problems created by lack of information and how this affects contracts and hence control of suppliers or distributors (and their management). The emphasis on the motivational analysis of each party is one way of looking at many of the problems of strategy, marketing, and public policy. The course is therefore of particular relevance to those who need to understand the workings of market competition. This would include those giving advice as consultants, investment bankers or at senior management levels.Syllabus:Basic PrinciplesFirm BoundariesCompetitive AdvantageStrategic BehaviourCompensation SchemesInnovation and EntrepreneurshipStudent Learning Experience:The course uses a mix of lectures and case studies.

    "summary": "The rise of emerging market multinational corporations (EMNCs) such as those from China, India, Russia and Brazil, is considered as 'the most notable dynamic in international business in the last few years' (Kostova, Marano, & Tallman, 2016, p. 182). UNCTAD data indicates that the share of EMNCs in the world's outward foreign direct investment has witnessed dramatic increase in recent years, from 0.35% in 1970, to 5.05% in 2000, and over 35% in recent years. Extant research generally points to the fact that EMNCs behave differently from those from advanced markets such as US and Germany; as such, studying HRM in EMNCs provides a unique opportunity for us to reflect on exiting theories in the area of international human resource management and international management in general, which are largely based on analysis of advanced market MNCs. This course is designed to provide students with alternative perspectives and empirical evidence to understand this relatively new but important phenomenon in today's business world.",
    "course_description": "The course examines how emerging market multinational corporations (EMNCs e.g. firms from Brazil, Russia, India, China) deal with human resource management issues in the process of internationalisation. An institutional perspective will be adopted to analyse how the home country (i.e. where they come from) and host country (e.g. where they operate) institutions lead to some unique challenges faced by this particular type of MNCs.A wide range of topics are covered, including how emerging market MNCs are different from advanced market MNCs (e.g. firms from US and UK) in their approach to managing people, how they construct organisational identities to gain and maintain legitimacy in the West, and how they deal with the dilemma of centralisation and localisation issue.The course explores the implications of the rise of emerging market MNCs, and prepares students to become HR professionals, consultants, and business managers with specialist knowledge in HRM within the context of emerging market MNCs.Outlien Content- An introduction to EMNCs- Comparing EMNCs and AMNCs- The role of states- Organisational Legitimacy- Strategic CSR- Image and recruitment- Organisational control system- Global staffing- Reverse knowledge transferStudent learning expereinceThe course is delivered in the form of lectures. Case study examples are frequently used to facilitate interactive discussions in the class. Students are expected to actively participate in the class activities, and share their views and experiences on various issues. The emphasis throughout the course is on encouraging students to apply theories and ideas to real-world issues, and make recommendations to policy and practice.Tutorial/seminar hours represent the minimum total live hours - online or in-person - a student can expect to receive on this course. These hours may be delivered in tutorial/seminar, lecture, workshop or other interactive whole class or small group format. These live hours may be supplemented by pre-recorded lecture material for students to engage with asynchronously.",

The course aim is that students have a greater understanding of entrepreneurial finance and a practical set of tools to assess a business idea.This course is taught alongside its sister course, Entrepreneurship and New Venture Creation in Context. Both courses make use of lectures, workshops, case studies and guest speakers to help students to develop an awareness of, and competency in, start-ups. In terms of Entrepreneurial Finance, the sessions aim to develop student's financial literacy by understanding the fundamentals of financial information (e.g. Balance Sheet, Cashflow, Profit and Loss (Income) statements and financial ratios). They are expected to build on this to develop their financial intelligence by being able to analyse key financial information.This course is oriented around a group venture creation project in which participants develop a pitch and a plan to assess the feasibility and desirability of their chosen business.

In leading the value creation process, an entrepreneur must exercise motivation as well as enterprising and leadership skills.

    "course_description": "The course starts off by a reflection on ethical decision making when dealing with competing economic, social, environmental and governance priorities/pressures. It will then shift its focus to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) analysis, the challenges of converting complex social and environmental issues into numbers and of comparing such numbers across different entities. We will then delve into the politics of ESG reporting standards and the current trends in their uptake.In the second part of the course, we will discuss the institutional structure of the investments field, identifying different types of actors including both asset owners and asset managers and how they engage with ESG matters. We will then detail how investors use their capital to pressure their investees for adjustments in their ESG behaviour through diverse practices framed as shareholder engagement. We will wrap up the course with discussions about new forms of finance and their potentials for positive ESG impact ranging from blockchain to peer to peer / decentralized modes of financing and social impact bonds.The lecture series will focus on the following areas:1.

To facilitate a common level of understanding necessary for fruitful class discussion, some introductory readings may be suggested to students unfamiliar with basic concepts in e.g. general and strategic management.Outline content:- Historical development, prevalence and significance of the family business- Theories and tools for analysing a family business- Types of family firms- Relationships and conflict in family businesses- The succession process from both sides of the generational divide- Innovation and change in family businesses- Family businesses and global grand challengesThe course will be organized around five weekly sessions that combine a lecture-based discussion of assigned and suggested literature related to core topic of that week, with a seminar-based interactive session devoted to the in-class analysis and discussion of family business cases.A number of guest lectures relevant to the week's topic at hand complement the theory-based sessions and will allow students to assess the practical validity of their class learnings.Students are encouraged to bring up real-life family business-related issues, both from own experience and from current events covered in media.",

    "summary": "Financial markets have been radically transformed in recent decades through the development of new financial products, technologies, and infrastructures, a pattern that is only accelerating with ongoing developments in FinTech. This course will provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand the social, political/regulatory, and technological consequences of these developments.",
    "course_description": "Financial markets are continually transformed through the development of new financial products and technologies. While FinTech represents the latest wave of financial innovation, earlier decades saw the development of swaps and options, exchange-traded funds, mortgage securitisation, algorithmic trading, as well as novel risk management techniques such as portfolio insurance.This course is designed to provide students studying on the Finance, Technology and Policy MSc programme with the knowledge and skills necessary to critically examine the social, political, and technological impacts of innovation in finance on markets, institutions, and broader society.This course addresses this topic by examining:- The historical development of core financial infrastructures (e.g. those related to payments, lending, etc.) and the impacts innovation in these infrastructures has had on markets and society;- How ongoing technological innovation in FinTech (e.g. in areas such as blockchain and AI) are shaping, and in some cases are replacing, these infrastructures, and their potential consequences for markets and society.The course addresses this topic through an interdisciplinary lens. Thus, while the course draws on the economics literature on financial innovation, it also draws on concepts and theories from strategic management, political economy, economic sociology, and science and technology studies. Theoretically, the course approaches the study of financial innovation through an 'infrastructural' lens, rather than a focus on discrete technologies: that is, one that focuses on the interconnected systems/assemblages of practices, routines, standards, and devices that underpins the day-to-day operation of financial markets. The focus of lectures and seminars will be to draw practical lessons from several historical episodes of financial innovation to shed light on the possible consequences of ongoing developments in FinTech.Course materials will evolve to reflect ongoing developments in the FinTech space. The following two lectures will introduce students to the FinTech sector and provide conceptual/theoretical tools for understanding innovations in this space:- Introduction to Financial Technology (FinTech)- Theorizing FinTech Innovation: products, technologies, and infrastructuresThe last three weeks of the course will focus on the development of specific financial infrastructures that are currently undergoing change due to developments in FinTech. Indicative lecture titles include:- Payment infrastructures: From SWIFT to blockchains- Lending infrastructures: How AI is transforming consumer lending- Trading and settlement infrastructures: From trading 'pits' to automated market makers",

    "summary": "Financial markets have been radically transformed in the last decade through developments in financial technology (FinTech). This course will provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to critically assess (1) the economic, social, and political implications of novel financial technologies and (2) the role of policy and regulation in shaping financial innovation.",
    "course_description": "This course is designed to provide students studying on the Finance, Technology and Policy MSc programme with the knowledge and skills necessary to critically examine the social, political, and technological impacts of FinTech innovations and the role of government policy and regulation in shaping their direction of development.The course addresses this topic through an interdisciplinary lens. While the course draws on the economics literature on financial innovation, it also draws on concepts and theories from strategic management, political economy, economic sociology, and science and technology studies. Theoretically, the course approaches the study of fintech innovation through an infrastructural lens, rather than a focus on discrete technologies: that is, one that focuses on the interconnected systems/assemblages of practices, routines, standards, and devices that underpin the day-to-day operation of financial markets and fintech products. Lectures develop main concepts and ideas while seminars draw practical lessons from practical case studies to shed light on the possible consequences of ongoing developments in FinTech.Outline contentWhile the exact structure may change to reflect ongoing developments, the following is an indicative summary of lecture titles:1. Introduction to Financial Technology2. Historical Precedents: the Automation of Stock Exchanges3. Historical Precedents: the 2008 Financial Crisis and the Rise of FinTech4. FinTech Platforms, Ecosystems, and Stacks5. PayTech and Payments Infrastructures6. Blockchain and Infrastructures of Decentralization7. The Changing Infrastructures of Lending and Banking8. Machine Learning and the Changing Infrastructures of Financial Modelling9. RegTech and SupTech10. FinTech Policy Old and New Challenges",

This includes those outside the business such as investment analysts and within the business those responsible for strategy (including execution) and those responsible for relations with outside stakeholders including investors and banks. Financial statements do not exist in a vacuum but are a reflection of business activity. To understand financial statements it is necessary to understand business activity and vice versa. The course therefore is as much about business and business strategy as it is about accounting. A good company is identified as one with a good strategic story and good financial numbers. The ideas of the course are explored through an in depth analysis of the annual report and financial statements for a number of interesting companies.

The threat of such change represents the ultimate sanction on existing management by shareholders dissatisfied with firm performance or governance. Changes both to owners' expectations and management are intended to correct failing business strategies and disappointing financial performance. M&As not only affect firm performance but also the wider society. While M&As may help promote capital market and general economic allocative efficiency, not all transactions are in the public interest.The course aims to give students a good appreciation of the theoretical, practical and institutional aspects of mergers & acquisitions, with a focus on some the financial aspects of such deals.

    "summary": "This course focuses on the application of financial principles and, in particular, derivatives in addressing financial problems. There will be a focus on the the use of derivatives as risk-management and securities structuring instruments.",
    "course_description": "This course is built around four key areas which relate to how the principles of finance and derivatives, in particular, can be used to address problems in finance. As a topic, financial engineering is strongly practical while at the same time drawing on key insights from finance and the pricing of derivatives. it makes use of  a wide variety of insights from the theory and practice of financial management and integrates these into how they are applied in practice through the way \"structured securities\" are created as well as other examples of financial engineering (e.g. risk management).Over the course, students will be exposed to a variety of applications of the key tools of finance, both in terms of how to model cash flows and making use of the derivative product set (that is, forward contracts, futures, swaps and options).The course will provide examples of how the tools, knowledge and understanding of the derivative product set can be applied to particular representative problems in securities structuring, risk management and cash flow sculpting. A key part of the subject is to demonstrate the practical application of both the theory and practice of finance within a range of contexts. Consequently, the emphasis in the course is on practical financial management and pricing transactions rather than the mathematics of derivatives. To integrate the discussion, the course stresses the relationship that exists between derivatives and fundamental financial instruments (cash securities) and, in particular, the important no-arbitrage conditions that underlie the pricing of derivatives. Note that the course does not delve into the more advanced aspects of derivatives valuation such as stochastic processes, although an intuitive understanding of this is required.After introducing the key elements of financial engineering early on, the course will explore initially how to use terminal instruments (forwards, futures and swaps) before expanding to examine the important role played by options as risk management tools. Key aspects of options, their modelling and risk management are covered within the focus on practical application of these instruments either on their own or as part of a portfolio.Student Learning ExperienceStudent learning on this course will primarily be through reading, thinking, class discussions, attending lectures and tutorials, solving exercises, and attempting problems. The ideas introduced by the course can take time to absorb and students should expect to have to go over some ideas several times before they are understood properly.",

The course considers stock market prices and returns; stock market risk and the influence of risk on the pricing of shares;  interest rates and the pricing of bonds; and the characteristics and pricing of financial futures and options. It also considers Corporate Finance and Financial Theories.  But the most important contribution of this course to your future career is how to use the academic insights to better assess risks and returns, and the trade-off between the two in your future decision making.Scientific insights develop and change over time. Traditional views on financial markets are changing rapidly and many of the standard paradigms and theory are nowadays questioned. On the one hand because of recent developments like the recent financial crisis, on the other hand because of new theoretical and empirical developments in the academic literature. This course aims to consider issues from both theoretical perspective as well as practical perspective. It will address both the standard theory but also offer some of the new and alternative views. It is important to be aware of the most well used theoretical models from a practical point of view but it is also important for students who want to follow an academic career.Outline ContentThe topics covered in this course can be broadly categorised into three groups:*Financial Theories. This includes portfolio theory, the capital asset pricing model and the arbitrage pricing theory, all of which have become an integrated part of the decision-making in investments. It will also discuss patterns in cross-sections of stock returns, the time-series behaviour of stick returns time-varying expected returns.*Introduction to Fixed-Income and Derivative Instruments. This includes bonds, options and futures.*Corporate Finance: This includes capital budgeting, cost of capital, capital structure.",

The past decades saw the evolution of business studies to address management problems with strategic uncertainty, in which different individuals, divisions and/or firms strategically interact with each other. Strategic interactions in multi-agent problems create new challenges for managers. As a natural quantitative analytical tool for such multi-agent decision making problems, game theory has widely and successfully been applied to the field of business management. This course introduces game theory as analytical tools and provides insights into managerial situations in order to assist with decision making when multiple agents with conflicting objectives are involved. To be more specific, it provide students with both cooperative and non-cooperative game theory based quantitative frameworks to analyse strategic interactions in economic problems and its impact on managerial decision making and to understand strategic situations in which different individuals/divisions/firms may have potentially conflicting incentives.",

    "course_description": "The course will provide a critical understanding of data visualizations (e.g. dashboards) to equip managers with practical tools to govern ambiguity, complexity and the management of unknown-unknowns in decision-making processes. It draws on theories developed in interdisciplinary accounting, science and technology studies, rhetoric and communication studies blending them in ways that equip students with a novel understanding of the roles that data visualizations and financial representations play in organizations and megaprojects.At the end of the course, participants are expected to:Understand the use in practice and limitations of basic financial techniques to assess the viability of major investment decisions;Link various degrees of risk to different financing options and understand how financial metrics may distort our perception of risk and feasibility;Design data visualizations to monitor performance, stimulate collaboration and mediation of conflicting interests, question taken-for-granted assumptions when making decisions;Utilise performance measurement and control techniques to mobilise change, increase chances of success and avoid failure;Be aware of the organisational, political and social role that accounting figures can play in practical settings where stakeholders have varied and conflicting interests.Outline ContentThe first Sessions (1 to 4) are dedicated to introduce the overall themes of the course, its structure, the role of the participants in class and, above all, the approach followed in treating issues of management control under situations of risk and uncertainty, especially in relation to large organizations and megaprojects. We will move beyond a conventional view of management control as a mere technical matter based on objective accounting calculations to introduce various roles that these play in organizations and programme management.While the first 4 sessions serve to identify various roles that management control practices play in organizations that operate under conditions of risk and uncertainty. This second block of sessions (5 and 6) is used to discuss some technical issues and calculative practices, and assess their pros and cons when used for supporting large infrastructural and industrial investment decisions. Specifically, we will look at risks entailed by cash flow discounting techniques in assessing viability of such investments and the factors to take into account when evaluating large infrastructure investments. We will also discuss how financial numbers can be used in managing stakeholders and media when communicating (intermediate and final) financial results.The remining sessions (7 to 10)of the course will explore how to build effective management control systems in situations of ambiguity and uncertainty, introducing issues related to assessing performance and risk, and controlling the ongoing development of the venture. Here we will identify a series of principles that can be used to design effective data visualizations in order for them to work as tools to govern uncertainty and manage the complexities entailed by unknown-unknowns.Student Learning ExperienceThe course combines traditional lecturing, with case study discussion and workshop with group work and peer learning.The course requires students to prepare the cases to be discussed before class. It is envisaged that each case requires two hours of preparation.The course is run more along the lines of an executive education course than a conventional MSc class. This is in line with recent innovations in the delivery of business education also at the post-graduate level which sees the increasing importance of group activities within settings that are more similar to a workshop than a traditional front lecture. The combination of lecturing with supervised workshop and outside class work also enables an effective combination of abstract academic knowledge with the enhancement of practical skills. More generally, a good combination of lecturing and active student participation avoids loss of attention and helps focusing.",

    "summary": "Real life decision problems are often too complicated to be modelled by e.g., mathematical tools. Even if they are modelled, these type of problems are often intractable and extremely challenging to solve. In recent years, the emergence of approximation techniques as an alternative way of solving problems in areas such as optimisation has attracted attentions from both academics and practitioners. This course offers alternative approaches to solve complex problems which could otherwise be difficult to solve by traditional techniques. It aims at training students in the field of approximation (e.g., heuristics, metaheuristics, hyperheuristics and evolutionary computations) to address decision making problems in business.",

    "summary": "This course provides a broad introduction to, and understanding of, the principal internal and external environmental contexts of contemporary organisations. This covers both the managerial and business context, within which Human Resource Management (HRM) professionals, managers and employees must learn to interact, often under challenging conditions of environmental turbulence, change and uncertainty.",
    "course_description": "The course examines how leading organisations in various sectors and industries respond to trends and features of their dynamic internal and environmental contexts. It indicates how those working in the HR function need to work with the rest of the organisation and its stakeholders to recognise and acknowledge how corporate decisions are shaped by various forces, and how these decisions might be made most effectively given the business environment.This means learning to identify and evaluate a range of internal and external forces, often beyond the immediate or direct control of the HR function itself. Having studied this course, students will therefore be aware that HR professionals and managers in different types of organisation (small, large, national, global) not only have opportunities and choices when taking organisational decisions, but also face some constraints on their autonomy in determining their futures.The course explores the implications for professional HR policy and practice of engaging with broader business environments and trends, and provides opportunities for applied learning and continuous professional development.Outline Content1.\tHRM in contemporary organisations and defining business environments.2.\tThe line management and professional context of HRM.3.\tHRM (and general business) strategy.4.\tMarket and competitive organisational environments facing HRM.5.\tGlobalisation and the world economy's impact on HRM.6.\tGovernment policy, legal regulation, and HRM.7.\tDemographic and social trends affecting HRM.8.\tTechnology and HRM.9.\tEthics, social responsibility, sustainability and HRM.10.\tCourse overview and revision of weeks 1-9.Student Learning ExperienceThis course provides students with a wide understanding of the boundaries and key areas of concern across the field of HRM, through examples and topics addressed in lectures. Lectures will all be digitally recorded using Panopto software so students can listen to them again in a flexible and interactive format.The students use class exercises and case study examples to facilitate interactive student discussions applying HRM frameworks to contemporary business problems, with formative feedback provided to individuals and groups where appropriate. Two guest speakers with established backgrounds in the HR profession will also deliver sessions in the course on cutting-edge areas of HR strategy and practice that have been, and can be, applied to client organisations where HR is making a real difference to success.Assessment provides opportunities for students to analyse HRM issues and topics by critically and in more depth, summarising multiple viewpoints and making related recommendations for policy and practice, and receiving further formative and summative feedback on completion of this assessed work.",

    "summary": "China is now home to the world's fastest development of innovations, particularly in the digital space, offering a rapidly changing array of internet and mobile technology-based services across a wide range of industries from e-commerce, fintech, music, literature and film creative culture to sharing economies and climate change. China's innovation has been transforming the country over the last decade. Once an economic backwater, later dismissed as copycats and now poised to challenge the world, China's rise has engendered great fears and hostile sentiments. These developments demand rigorous study, understanding and critical evaluation.This course will require students to engage with a range of radical and disruptive innovations, including topics, such as WeChat, TikTok, Huawei, big data of peoples' footprints during the pandemic, social credit, digital currency, climate change, artificial intelligence, micromobility and the development of sharing economy platforms.Students will be introduced to the complex and sometimes, contradictory features of Chinese society that underpin these developments: the seemingly competing value systems running through China's recent history in the transition from a traditional hierarchical society, the socialist legacy of central planning and the market system with Chinese characteristics. Students will explore the distinctive social-technical features of digital technology, such as connectivity, information flow and social media engendering mass participation, transparency and decentralised governance.",
    "course_description": "This course will equip students with analytical frameworks to explore China's rise from an emerging economy to challenging for world leadership in innovation and to critically evaluate some controversial and disruptive innovative services that are arising under the dominant social norms and business models in the developed world. The course will centre around case study research and group discussion, which will encourage students to engage with various theoretical frameworks and different perspectives in these developments.The objectives of the course are to encourage students to:- Understand intertwined and dynamic relations between innovation and the social and technological contexts in which they emerge and in turn, become embedded and transform.- Engage with various conceptual and analytical frameworks derived from a range of cognate disciplines, including business, political economy, philosophy, culture and social studies of technology.- Develop an understanding of distinctive features of China's social structure and governance, cultural tradition and the ongoing transformation of the business environment- Critically evaluate challenging issues/events/matters from diverse positions, and in particular, to engage with internal and external perceptions of developments in China.Outline:1 - Introduction of conspicuous cases, for example, WeChat, TikTok, Huawei, during the US-China trade war and innovative business experimentation in the areas of fintech, mobility and renewable energy (it may change annually), and an overview of the current innovation and the traditional and institutional contexts in China.2 - Introduction of multiple conceptual and analytical frameworks for understanding3 - Case material will encompass various innovations, such as internet financial services to SMicroEs, mobile technology ecosystem from 3G to 5G, integrated online literature, music &film creative culture services, electric car and charging networks, bicycle-sharing schemes, etc. Case analyses will adopt conceptual and analytical frameworks, for example, to examine the social and technical elements underlying China's mobile apps for COVID 19 track tracing and the relationship between the innovation and the embedding cultural and social contexts in China, to explore different social-technical features of track-tracing technologies developed and employed in other countries across the world during the COVID 19 pandemic.Student experience:- To explore the Chinese business environment, being aided with available literature and information in varied media forms, to know the Chinese characteristics of the modern landscape of the society and the economy, which has built on the culture and social norms rooted in a long history.- To recognise a value system different from students own and be familiar with the diversity of the world we are living in.- To dialogue and exchange perspectives and views with peer students brought up in different cultures and educational backgrounds and to learn by self-awareness and reflection .- To practise useful skills for researching, analysing, written presentation and team working.Tutorial/seminar hours represent the minimum total live hours - online or in-person - a student can expect to receive on this course. These hours may be delivered in tutorial/seminar, lecture, workshop or other interactive whole class or small group format. These live hours may be supplemented by pre-recorded lecture material for students to engage with asynchronously.",

It is open to students from non-business programmes (MSc and PhD students across the University). This course teaches some of the generic understanding of entrepreneurship and innovation, as well as specialised topics related to Design Thinking and Data-driven Business Model Innovation. It raises the student's awareness of the process of setting up a new venture, and more broadly, encourages students to be innovative thinkers in a variety of organisational contexts. The primary focus is on the development of a business opportunity evaluation report to pursue a data-driven and/or technology idea either for commercial or social purposes.",
    "course_description": "This online course to innovation-driven entrepreneurship introduces students to basic concepts and main theoretical frameworks on entrepreneurship. It uses a wide range of learning technologies to deliver the contents of the course, including video lectures, recordings of entrepreneurial journeys in a variety of industries, other audio-visual content, online activities and reading materials. This course is delivered entirely online, and students will need to complete an individual report that consists of the assessment of a business opportunity idea. The course aims to be practice-oriented and equip students with knowledge that can be applied to different business contexts.The acquisition of entrepreneurial skills is central to the pedagogy of the course, which has been designed to identify and develop creative and critical thinking, interpersonal and analytical skills key in the pursuit of a business opportunity. Students will be able to apply this knowledge and skills to different organisational settings both for social and for-profit purposes.Outline contentEntrepreneurship has become one of the most powerful and influential forces of change in the world. Technological innovation driven by scientific research has led to radical social and economic changes. Companies like Apple, Facebook, Genentech, and Cisco, all derive their success in part due to the innovative application of novel technology. However, advanced technology alone is not sufficient to guarantee either user adoption or commercial success. Many ideas and technologies are abandoned or ignored despite presenting apparently significant advantages over incumbent systems. This course introduces students to the theory and practice of entrepreneurship. It focuses specifically on how and why some innovations are successfully commercialised, with specific reference to science-driven innovations, which may be relevant to your programmes of study.The frameworks presented in the course will help you reflect on the identification, development and implementation of business opportunities in a variety of contexts, underscoring the innovation potential of different business models. As part of the contents of the course, you will explore entrepreneurship as a process that requires knowledge, soft skills and resources. You will examine different entrepreneurial contexts and types of business opportunities and learn how to assess the attractiveness of markets and industries to come up with strong business ideas.Student Learning ExperienceThis course is based on active learning and utilises a wide range of learning materials that go from independent reading and primary research to video-lectures and exposure to practice. Students who participate in and engage with every mode of study are most likely to gain the most learning out of this course.

    "course_description": "One of the educational aims of the MBA is to enable students to gain an understanding of the challenges facing businesses and leaders in different contexts. It is important for strategic leaders of the future to understand the implications of different economic, political, legal, social and ecological environments for business operations, innovation, entrepreneurship and leadership practice. Emerging markets are generating unprecedented opportunities, but they are complex and risky. Businesses wishing to cultivate trading relationships with emerging countries need to set-aside their 'developed world' mentality and re-tool business models, products, and strategies if they are to be successful. Too often, companies underestimate the unique challenges of managing businesses in radically different contexts. This course will take students out of the classroom to study for a short period in a context which is unfamiliar. Teaching will include contributions from local faculty and business practitioners, alongside direct observation and experiential learning in local companies.SyllabusIntroduction to international strategy and emerging economies.Historical and recent developments in the economic and political environment of the target country;Developments in, and characteristics of, the socio-cultural and ecological environment;Local business challenges, and the implications of government policy;Local business practices and the influencing factors;Implications for organisations wishing to expand in the target country.Student Learning ExperienceIn an initial preparation day, participants will be presented with key international business concepts that help managers and firms in international business. They will then spend a week in the target country where they will learn the practice, experientially.   With the support of a programme team, they will work on an international business project on behalf of an international firm based there, supported through a range of guest speakers and site visits. Through these activities participants will develop a critical understanding of how different contexts change how business opportunities and leadership can be pursued in practice.",

    "summary": "The course aims to explore key concepts and considerations related to the topic international climate finance. The course will focus principally on the role of governments and public sector actors in providing, catalysing and mobilising financial flows for climate change mitigation and adaptation in both developing and developed countries. It explores the connections between the political \"100 billion\" climate finance commitment at the international level and the \"100 trillion\" investment challenge governments face to meet the investment needs to transform national economies. It will look at the different tools, instruments, and policies that these mandates entail - as well as  the interactions between governments and the private sector as public resources are used to 'leverage', 'redirect' and 'blend' additional private finance and investment. It will go beyond mitigation objectives to present an overview of the challenges related to adaptation, research & development financing, supporting SMEs and the creation of entire climate service value chains. Finally, the course will also provide an introduction to the concepts of 'concessionality' and the measuring and evaluation frameworks used by public institutions to determine how public funds are used for climate finance.",
    "course_description": "The course aims to provide students with an understanding of principal concepts upon which decisions around international climate finance are made. It will compare and contrast the different conceptual framings that influence how governments use public resource to achieve often complementary, but at times divergent, goals on climate change. The course aims to provide students with the fundamental concepts to analyse and understand the choices on climate finance and investment made by governments and their implementing institutions and agencies. The course will explore the connection between public policy, public financial institutions, and the private sector, seeking to understand how public resources are used to \"redirect\", \"leverage\", \"mobilise\" and \"blend\" private finance and investment.The course develops the key concepts, critical understanding and hard skills to assess and understand the strengths and weaknesses of different types of public intervention. Students will develop their ability to assess how governments and public financial institutions determine the appropriate use of public funds through an assessment of different approaches to concessionality and concessional finance. It will also explore some of the principal components of measuring and evaluation frameworks used by these institutions to determine how public funds are used for climate finance.The course will build on the fundamental concepts and critical understanding developed in the first half of Semester 1 in the Climate Change Policy and Investment course. It will run in parallel to Carbon Markets course as well as Applied Energy Finance - providing complementary insights on how public actors frame and act on investment and finance topics. The concepts introduced will provide a foundation for the courses in Semester 2, particularly in the Climate Risk and Investment Alignment course.Outline Content1.\tOverview of the mandates of governments on climate, investment and finance2.\tIntroduction to the governmental tools and institutions used to support climate finance objectives3.\tMapping international and domestic climate finance and investment4.\tThe role of public finance institutions (including domestic promotional banks, multi-lateral development banks, export credit agencies)5.\tThe role of international climate funds and mechanisms6.\tFinancial mechanisms and instruments (concessional finance, blended finance, bonds, guarantees, results-based payments)7.\tMeasuring & Evaluation frameworks8.\tEthical considerations with national and international climate finance9.\tHow concessionality is understood in terms of climate change and public finance10.\tPublic support for adaptation, national policy frameworks and value chain development11.\tA critical perspective on public intervention: examples of crowding out and  crowding inStudent Learning ExperienceThe course will be taught through weekly lectures and will generally include a case study, group exercise or other interactive discussion component.

    "summary": "During the PhD, a student has three objectives. First, develop themselves as a scholar and as a person; second, create a portfolio of research papers, some of which should be published prior to graduation; third, plan, carry out, and write up a major research project that will constitute the doctoral thesis. On graduation students will be expected to have produced a thesis that advances our theoretical understanding of a business-related topic. This means that they should be at the cutting edge of knowledge in that area, something that will be formally assessed. In so doing, they will develop the tools that will prepare them for a successful academic career.This course is designed to point new doctoral researchers in the right direction with regards to the objectives outlined above. It is intended that PhD students will take this course during their first year.",
    "course_description": "This programme of topics is intended to iteratively build towards the provision of a holistic understanding of some of the key things that are required to be successful in the doctoral programme. It should also provide a solid foundation of good practices to stand students in good stead throughout their careers.The course has a programme of two-hour weekly seminars for 11 weeks. There is a required text which is provided to all students and a poster presentation session which is assessed and attendance is compulsory.This course will be primarily organised around interactive discussions that will often involve guest speakers. In this way, students will get opportunities to interact with some of the leading research faculty in the Business School, all of who have extensive experience of working with doctoral students. Students will also hear from a recently completed doctoral student discussing various aspects about how they carried out their PhD, what they did when things went wrong, how they went about presenting at conferences, publishing their first paper, and so on.",

Groups of 3-5 students will cooperate to plan and implement a joint study project related to a problem within the realm of environmental sustainability or social impact, which will be agreed between the supervisor and students. Students will collectively develop the overall scope of the project, data collection and understanding of the background and contextual knowledge of the case. The joint effort will culminate in the creation of an output (e.g. report, multimedia, video, website, etc.)  which synthesises the collective findings of the joint study in a logically coherent narrative that is accessible for a non-expert audience.

The course will seek to fully expose the messy, non-linear ways in which change usually takes place, and the importance of change leaders understanding the contextual imperatives that will play a defining role in the contouring of the change process.",
    "course_description": "As organizational environments become increasingly dynamic, with technological, economic, political and social, changes occurring at ever faster rates, so the transformation of organizational structures and practices has become arguably the most pervasive issue with which organizational leaders have to contend. Whether it be adopting a new technology, restructuring to improve efficiency, or expanding an operation to a new geographical locale, so being able to cope with, and lead, change efforts has become an ever more important part of the senior managerial role. Consequently, this course will develop your understanding of strategic organizational change processes.  While scholars and practicing managers have spent a great deal of time discussing how change takes place, this has frequently been overlaid with implicit, and often explicit, accounts of organizational transformations taking place in an orderly, linear fashion. These accounts are usually presented as being heavily top-down oriented with the individuals who must enact change, and are most affected by it, being largely omitted. By contrast, this course will seek to fully expose the messy, non-linear ways in which change usually takes place, and the importance of change leaders understanding the contextual imperatives that will play a defining role in the contouring of the change process. These include internal issues of power, culture, interests and communication, and external imperatives including political, economic, and social dimensions. With these points in mind, the intent is to cover a broad gamut of issues that are associated with change in order to provide participants with a comprehensive appreciation of what to expect when encountering, or leading, organizational transformation.SyllabusApproaches to change managementUnderstanding why organizations changeTypes of change - from incremental to radical transformationDiagnosing changeResistance to changeChange implementationThe visioning processCommunicating changeSustaining change.Student ExperienceThe intent of this course is to blend cutting-edge strategic change theories with practical examples, drawn from selected cases, guest speakers and participants own personal experiences. The approach is highly interactive Â¿ one of the most important, and compelling, aspects of EMBA classes is the communal development and application of understanding benefiting from the varied experiences of class members. Given that everybody in the class will have experienced, or will be currently contending with, major strategic change initiatives, the course has been structured to allow class members to apply the principles that they learn to their own change cases. If appropriate, proposed courses of action can be developed and shared within the group.",

By taking this course, students will gain a deep understanding of how to sense AI opportunities and develop strategies for exploiting them in their organizations, of the challenges involved in the implementation of AI in their organizations and of what responsible and ethical deployment of AI means in practice. Students will also learn how to evaluate different use cases for deploying AI within organization to support decision making and the consequences of AI use on the organizational actors involved, and how to explore the market and societal impact of AI, including the broader ethical implications of AI use.",
    "course_description": "AI is transforming the way businesses operate and compete. Compared with other forms of digital technologies, current AI technologies have greater autonomy, deeper learning capacity and are more inscrutable. These unique characteristics create exceptional opportunities and challenge for businesses, and for the managers that lead them. Managing AI is unlike any kind of digital or information technology management of the past.Building upon your knowledge of how digital technologies in general are transforming organisations which you have gained in your core courses, this course focuses specifically on the unique implications that AI has for business, and for the managers that seek to leverage it to create value for their organisations.The course is divided into four parts:Planning for AI: This section will examine the opportunities and broad strategies for organizations to exploit AI to create value.Adopting AI: This section will examine the challenges and approaches to implement AI in organizations, including the operationalization of responsible AI principles in practice to ensure the moral and ethical deployment of AI.Using AI to support decision making: This section will explore the use cases of AI in supporting decision making in organizations, including examining bias and challenges with AI-based decision making, and the consequences that AI use has on the employees within organizations.The societal impact of AI: This section will examine the consequences of AI-based algorithms for consumers, market dynamics, and societal norms including a broader discussion of the ethical implications of AI use.Business managers play a critical role in shaping the future of AI: it is managers who allocate resources to buying specific applications, oversee their implementation in their organisations and decide how to translate generic guidelines for responsible AI into practice. It is managers who use them in decision making and leverage them to target customers, monitor processes and inform decisions. And it is managers who decide what criteria to use to evaluate their success or otherwise. It is thus essential for any future business manager to understand the opportunities, challenges and implications of AI for their organization and beyond, and learn how it can be leveraged to create value responsibly.By taking this course, you will gain the skills and knowledge to sense and seize AI opportunities, to plan the implementation of AI in your organizations, to assess the different use cases to deploy AI for decision making, and to evaluate the market and societal consequences of AI. By the end of the course, you will have developed a deep understanding of the implications of AI for managing business.Planning for AI: Sensing AI opportunities and formulating AI strategies.Adopting AI: Planning AI implementation in different contexts and operationalising responsible AI.Using AI to support decision making: AI use cases, biases and other challenges, implications on individual creativity and organisational power.The societal impact of AI: Consequences of algorithmic recommendation systems for consumers, for market dynamics, and for societal norms.The course content is designed to be engaging and thought-provoking. Over the four days, you will learn about the latest trends and best practices in AI, and will have the opportunity to apply your knowledge to real-world scenarios through case studies. The afternoons will be spent working in groups to address a particular problem associated with the theme we cover each day. During this time, you will be encouraged to reflect on the opportunities and challenges that AI present to your own businesses. The last day will involve the groups presenting the work they have engaged in throughout the week.",

Shifts in market, the emergence of new technologies, changes in the political and regulatory landscape, competition and globalisation compel both entrepreneurs and existing firms to foster innovation. This course examines the activities, practices and competencies involved in managing innovation in firms, whether they are start-ups or established firms, and large or small. The course explores the approach to organise and manage innovation across the range of different types of innovation, whether product, services, technologies or business models.",
    "course_description": "Aims, Nature, Context:The ability of organisations to manage innovation is critical to their survival whether these organisations are small start-ups or large, established multinationals. While competitive advantage can come from size, location, or the possession of rare and inimitable resources, the pattern is increasingly favouring those organisations which can mobilize market and technological skills and experience to create novelty in their products and services, and in the ways in which they create and deliver these products and services. The aim of this course is to clarify what innovation is, and how it can be organised and managed in firms in order to create value. This course will provide students with a foundational knowledge of the key concepts and frameworks of innovation and an awareness of their practical application within organisations which is necessary for later practical and theoretical courses in the MSc in Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme.Topics include but are not limited to:Nature of innovationStructure for innovationInnovation cultureInnovation strategyInnovation process (developing new products and services)Value of InnovationStudent learning experience:Tutorial/seminar hours represent the minimum total live hours - online or in-person - a student can expect to receive on this course.

The course will help students identify the complex web of corporate stakeholder relationships; identify potential crisis issues; understand the importance of consistent communications to establish and maintain reputation and trust; devise processes to manage ongoing communications; consider tools to assist in building strong stakeholder relationships; develop tools to help influence the influencers; and devise processes to ensure the effective management of crises.",
    "course_description": "The traditional paradigms of corporate and marketing communications are being challenged in an increasingly complex global environment including 'wicked problems' and world economic crises. At the same time, businesses must adapt to increasingly knowledgeable and powerful stakeholders who expect immediate, 24/7, often personalised, communication from organisations. If concerns are identified by stakeholders, they can be shared worldwide in seconds via digital media. Whereas in previous generations, businesses could compartmentalise and manage stakeholder relationships, todayÂ¿s technology ensures the corporate brand is more a co-creation by stakeholders and the organisation, based on trust, transparency and sharing. More than ever, external and internal communications need to be strategically managed, consistent and timely to build commitment between the organisation and its stakeholders. Business leaders need to understand the dynamic environment, the inter-connectivity of stakeholders and the consequences of poor communications. A clear and consistent corporate vision and brand is needed to build trust. Business Leaders need to understand the processes and tools available to achieve affective communication. They need to recognise, anticipate and respond to potential issues/crises before they develop and create permanent damage. This course will address a significant gap in traditional management education.SyllabusTheoretical context, stakeholders, inter-relationships and potential issues.Corporate vision, leadership and brand; Building stakeholder relationships.Strategic tools to help communicate the vision and brand.Day to day management: communications planning process and media management (including social media tools).Influencing the influencers: investor relations, government/NGOs, local/national funders, banks and specifically key shareholders.Integrated view of stakeholder relations; Issues and crisis management.Student Learning ExperienceThe format will involve interactive lectures, case studies, buzz groups, student presentations; expert panel interviews and guest lecturers; simulated crisis role play and in-class debates.",

The course will engage students in the (marketing) research process, which involves the systematic gathering, recording and analysis of both primary and secondary data.Overview of Research Methods for both academic and industry insight. During the course we will cover:-Understanding the research process (for academic and industry purposes)- Research philosophy (paradigms, ontologies and epistemologies)- Research Design & Methods (quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods approach)- Qualitative Data collection (Interviews & Focus Groups, Ethnography & Netnography, Creative Research Methods) & Data Analysis- Research ethics and researcher reflexivity- Data literacy for Industry (practice & theory)- Understanding Statistics (key concepts, descriptive and inferential statistics)- Experimental data analysis- Moderation, mediation and regression analysis- Training in Quantitative data software (SPSS)Student learning experience : -During lectures we will cover a wide range of content on the research process and the use of qualitative and quantitative methods in academic and industry research.  Students will be informed from a practitioner perspective as course lecturers work closely with industry partners.To complement these didactic lectures, the course fosters active learning and higher order thinking through carefully designed seminars and computer labs, where students are encouraged to apply their learning to practical scenarios using real data. During these sessions, students will learn-by-doing as they apply their data analysis and interpretation skills to qualitative data (in seminars) and quantitative data (in computer labs).All teaching on the course will be highly interactive with students having the opportunity to pose questions, engage in their learning and work in small groups as well as individually.As part of the course, students will also learn how to search for academic and industry sources (e-journals and wider reading) and learn how to relate this literature to the research process with confidence and professionalism.",

This method forms the basis for carbon offset crediting, policy appraisal/evaluation, results-based payments, and measuring the impact of investment decisions. The course aims to provide students with practical experience in using this method through applying concepts and techniques to case study interventions. Students will also develop skills in thinking critically about emerging practice in this area, as not all current practice is necessarily good practice.",

Particular focus will be on the evolution of UK financial markets. The course will focus mainly on equity markets in the UK, with some focus on international equity markets, such as those in the United States and elsewhere.",
    "course_description": "Financial markets have undergone transformational changes over the past few decades; however, the last decade has witnessed the most significant changes in the way financial trading platforms operate. The changes induced by the declining costs of technology and changes in policy, hold significant implications for market structure in several respects. For example in Europe, the enactment of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) in 2007 coupled with technological advances in trading systems led to the proliferation of trading venues in Europe (i.e. new electronic competitors to traditional stock exchanges or securities exchanges).  These include Broker Crossing Networks (BCNs) and Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs) or Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs) as they are called in Europe. The growth of alternative platforms, as with algorithmic trading and high frequency trading, has been largely driven by technology. This course therefore provides an advanced level microstructure analysis of modern financial markets as viewed through the lens of the technological transformation markets have been subjected to over the past decade. Particular focus will be on the evolution of UK financial markets.Outline ContentFoundational topics- Introduction to the art of trading in financial markets and market microstructure- Liquidity- Price discoveryModern financial market microstructure- Algorithmic/high frequency trading- Market fragmentation- Dark tradingStudent Learning ExperienceFormal teaching occurs in lectures. Much of the learning will be the result of students' own reading and reflection, and preparation for lectures and coursework. A high level of student participation is expected, through discussion during lectures and working informally in groups. Scholarly endeavor is fundamentally about building on the discoveries and insights of others, and we hope that team co-operation will enrich all students. There will be time for questions and discussion in sessions at all times.",

    "summary": "Effective negotiation is one of the most valuable skills needed for success in leading major programmes. Expertise in this area (negotiation) leads to the crafting of better deals, helps manage teams and projects more efficiently, and facilitates the successful conduct of client and employee relations.This course offers useful and effective theoretical insights into the negotiation process. It also provides practical tools that can be used in a range of everyday situations. While the in-class exercises cover such apparently simple situations as buying a car or negotiating one's salary, the skills highlighted here are generally applicable in real-world situations of substantially greater commercial significance.These situations include determining the terms and conditions of one's individual employment; negotiating commercial contracts; corporate take-overs; union-management agreements; setting regulatory conditions; determining the location of an environmentally hazardous facility; and in resolving commercial disputes with third party intervention (mediation and arbitration). The negotiation situations under discussion and the in-class negotiation exercises start out as simple two party single-issue situations.  These grow in complexity with an increased number of 'issues on the table' and a larger number of negotiating parties.",
    "course_description": "This course addresses an area where many resource allocation decisions depend not on the outcome of market forces but on the interplay of bargaining between two or more groups. Such situations may be found in purchasing raw materials, in contracting for the services of engineers, architects, or builders, in determining the terms and conditions of a key employee's individual employment, in company take-overs, in union-management agreements concerning groups of workers, in insolvency situations, in agreeing compliance with regulatory conditions, in determining the location of an environmentally dangerous facility, and in many other areas of resource allocation.Some of the important considerations that bear on such situations have long been understood in economics, e.g. the concept of reservation price.   Others are only now being addressed.  These new developments principally concern game theory and can be traced back to the work of Thomas Schelling as summarised in his 'The Strategy of Conflict'. It has to be emphasised that, while strategic considerations form a key part of our approach, this is not a course in game theory and we do not pursue a theoretical approach.  The approach we adopt here is more behavioural and applied.This course attempts to recognise that the proper understanding of negotiation requires we go beyond the traditional boundaries of economics and management science, and address notions of bounded rationality, biases in decision making, social influence etc.   The course place considerable emphasis on bounded rationality and the social construction of reality.   It will also make extensive use of role-playing and group-based simulations. There will, therefore, be a substantial practical component to the teaching.Outline Content:1. Determining price and value; BATNA; zone of agreement; focal point; the canonical distributive bargaining case.2. Perceptions and biases; framing; anchoring; escalation.3. Strategic behaviour - two parties; commitment; integrative versus distributive negotiation.4. Strategic behaviour - more than two issues; more than two parties; coalitions.5. Bargaining over positions versus principles ('Getting to Yes').6. Third parties; facilitators, mediators, and arbitrators.7. Negotiation in the Shadow of the Law.8. Negotiating in the context of employment relations.9. Environmental conflict resolution.10. Ethics of negotiation; fairness, lies and 'strategic misrepresentations'.11. Negotiation and culture; Body Language.12.  Electronic NegotiationStudent Learning Experience:The course has a strong practical emphasis, with role-playing exercises included as a component of almost every session, which are combined with comprehensive class debriefs that seek to link practice with a fundamental theoretical analysis of the negotiation process.",

There will be a practical project running throughout the course based on a virtual tream-working exercise in which teams must produce digital products under competitive conditions. As part of this exercise, teams will have to develop a strategy and design an organisation to execute it during the exercise.The emphasis of the course is on blending theory and practice by putting ideas and concepts to work. This is achieved by analysing cases, by discussing real world problems with experienced practitioners and by practical exercises that provide the opportunity for you to put the ideas into action.",

    "summary": "There is growing interest in understanding how social innovation - about new approaches that are neither market, government nor traditional charitable approaches to enduring problems of social exclusion - which is arguably a major contributing factor to many of our most pressing social and environmental problems. These new approaches include 3rd sector organisations (social enterprises, low-profit corporations, co-operatives, community interest corporations, benefit corporations and other forms) as well as hybrid networks of government, industry and 3rd sector organisations. Effectively taking on these social and environmental issues however, requires a deeper understanding of the underlying causes of these problems and how designing and implementing solutions can pose specific challenges in terms of organisational design, management and oversight. This course seeks to provide students with greater insight into those challenges through a critical re-evaluation of social issues and case studies of innovative responses.",
    "course_description": "Social innovation - new approaches that are neither market, government nor traditional charitable approaches to enduring problems of social exclusion - are increasingly relied upon as catalysts for addressing difficult social and environmental issues. The aim of this course is to develop student knowledge and understanding about the organising challenges faced by organisations and social entrepreneurs that engage in the work of social innovation. In this course, students will gain a broader and deeper theoretical and contextual understanding of current and future opportunities and challenges in the field of social impact by drawing upon a range of concepts including complexity theory, systems thinking, strategy, and governance. Through theoretical and case-based work, students will develop transferable skills directly applicable to 3rd sector, government and private organisations engaged in social innovation initiatives.Outline content:1. Why social innovation? The history and context of the role of 3rd sector organisations and social innovation in building and reinforcing civil society and democratic norms. What are the current and future trends within the 3rd sector?2. Assessing social value. How can we measure ideas such as social capital and social impact? What are the implications of how we measure and how we frame these issues for communicating with crucial stakeholders.3. Spatial inequality. How are poverty and social deprivation related to the shape of our built environment? Are there ways of creating urban spaces that are more equitable and safer for all?4. Complex systems and systems thinking. Social problems are invariably embedded in complex systems. Developing effective responses requires an understanding of this complexity through conceptual tools such as systems thinking.5. Technology and inequality. Technology can bring us together as well as divide us. What is the role of algorithms for example in creating and reinforcing a 'digital divide' between those who are privileged and those who are not?",

    "summary": "The study of Artificial Intelligence and the development of tools aimed at analysing data (e.g., high-frequency trading data) from the many and growing data sources requires generating a systematic understanding of how we can learn from data. A principled approach to this problem is critical given the wide differences in the places these methods need to be used. There is no sector where this need is more obvious than in the financial services sector, where the provision of new consumer financial products requires a detailed understanding of consumer behaviour and needs. Financial services companies can develop an understanding of the data generating processes relevant to their product development and services delivery activities by generating algorithms that recognises patterns, for example, at cohort or societal levels. This course is an advanced offering that builds on the introduction to machine learning INFR11205 offers to help students develop further skills in the intelligent utilisation of machine learning methods in the context of financial data, such as high-frequency trading (HFT) and limit order book datasets (LOB). A key offering of this course is that students will gain access to real HFT LOB datasets and develop an understanding of how to adapt methods to fit problems rather than simply applying existing techniques to problems.",
    "course_description": "This course is for students who want to research and develop machine learning methods in the future. While IAML (INFR11205) focuses more on using machine learning methods, this course helps students develop skills needed for designing new machine learning methods tailored to use with financial and economic data such as HFT LOB datasets. It is also designed to be in a constant state of evolution; hence, the precise set of methods and algorithms employed in illustrating and exploring crucial concepts will undergo modifications from year to year. Furthermore, in order to maintain complementarity with other related courses on the MSc FTP, the course will also respond to changes in the curriculum of Financial Machine Learning (CMSE11475) and Financial Machine Learning II (Practical). However, the main topic headings are expected to be reasonably stable.Outline Content- Review of classification and gradient-based fitting- Expanded feature representations (e.g., basis functions, neural networks and kernel methods)- Generalization, regularization and inference (e.g., penalized cost functions, Bayesian prediction, learning theory)- Model selection, pruning and combination (e.g., cross-validation, Bayesian methods, sparsifying regularisers, ensemble methods)- Representation and metric learning (e.g., dimensionality reduction, clustering, feature learning)- Optimization and Inference algorithms (e.g., stochastic gradient descent, simple Monte Carlo ideas, and more specialized methods as required)- Formulating problems as machine learning-relevant and adapting methods to fit real forecasting problems such as stock price forecasting based on HFT frameworks- Ethical issues, such as responsible application of methods and privacy concerns",

Until recently, however, these have been treated as separate policy and regulatory domains. However, the emergence of FinTech has blurred the boundaries between these domains. This course provides students with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand the role that policymakers and regulators play in shaping technological innovations in finance, with a particular focus on the FinTech sector.",
    "course_description": "Around the world, states and governments are actively attempting to influence ongoing developments in financial technology to achieve their own policy objectives. On the one hand, this reflects a continuation of a long-standing effort on the part of states to shape finance and financial markets, as well as states' efforts to promote technology and innovation throughout the economy. On the other hand, the merging of finance and technological innovation -what historically were treated as rather separate policy domains - is creating new opportunities and challenges for financial market participants.This course provides students with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand the evolving relationship between finance, technology, and the state, and the implications of these changes for FinTech practitioners. To this end, this course addresses the following two broad questions:- Why have states and governments historically attempted to shape both the operation of financial markets and technological innovation throughout the economy, and what policy mechanisms have they used for each?- What new policy and regulatory challenges is the merger of finance and technology (through FinTech) creating for regulators and policymakers, and how are they responding to these challenges?This course, which is the second in a two-semester sequence of courses on FinTech policy and innovation, addresses these questions through an interdisciplinary lens, drawing on relevant historical and theoretical material from the fields of economics, political economy, law, sociology, and science and technology studies, which will be applied to shed light on emerging policy and regulatory issues in the area of FinTech.- The relationship between finance, technological innovation, and the state- The nuts and bolts of financial regulation- How regulators and policymakers shape innovation in finance- Technology and innovation policy for finance- Globalization and the problem of international governance- Emerging FinTech policy and regulatory challenges",

It also covers practical issues in predictive analytics and how to address them.The objective of this course is to enhance students' understanding of the importance of adopting a series of sound methodological steps in a prediction exercise and to provide them with an artillery of modelling and prediction techniques along with hands-on experience in using them. The course provides opportunities for students to learn from each other, from practitioners in the field, and from the latest theoretical and applied research in the field. The course will require students to work in groups on realistic projects in different business settings involving prediction of continuous and discrete variables, and to present their work to the rest of the class and course organiser.Student Learning ExperienceWeekly lectures and hands-on programming exercises in Python which enables students to implement the methodologies covered in class.",

    "course_description": "Optimisation problems are concerned with optimising an objective function subject to a set of constraints. When optimisation problems are translated into algebraic form, we refer to them as mathematical programmes. Mathematical programming, as an area within Operational Research (OR), Management Science (MS) and Business Analytics (BA), is concerned with model building and strategies and methods for solving mathematical programmes.In this course, we address model building in OR/MS/BA, present a variety of typical OR/MS/BA problems and their mathematical programming formulations, provide general tips on how to model managerial situations, and discuss solution strategies and present solution methods for linear and (mixed) integer programmes. This course aims to enhance students' understanding of the critical nature of building appropriate mathematical models as simplified representations of realistic managerial situations and the role such models play in prescribing solutions to decision-making problems. The course also aims to train students to critically assess mathematical programming models and solution methodologies. In addition, students will learn how to apply state-of-the-art prescriptive analytics tools in the context of decision problems faced by business managers. The course provides opportunities for students to learn from each other, from practitioners in the field, and the latest theoretical and applied research in the field. The course will require students to work in groups on realistic projects in different business settings involving prescriptive analytics and present their work to the rest of the class and an external panel when the projects are supplied by industry.Outline ContentThe course is organised around the following three main teaching topics:1. Introduction to OR/MS/BA, typical methodological steps of an OR/MS/BA study, and model building with applications in business decision-making.2. Linear programming (LP) - Review basic concepts and methods with applications in business decision-making.3. Integer programming (IP) - Basic concepts, relationship with linear programming, strategies and methods of solving integer programmes with applications in business decision-making.Student Learning ExperienceStudents are expected to learn basic concepts and theories from lectures. In tutorial sessions, they will learn how to apply the basic concepts and theories learned in the lectures and how to use optimisation solvers to address practical problems.Tutorial/seminar hours represent the minimum total live hours - online or in-person - a student can expect to receive on this course. These hours may be delivered in tutorial/seminar, lecture, workshop or other interactive whole class or small group format.

Recognising the challenges often faced by students in reflective practice, this topic will be covered as a standalone session within the core content (as previously highlighted). This will equip the students with models of reflective practice, which will be of value across many aspects of the wider MBA programme.Personal effectiveness: leadership; planning and organising, effective team working; assertiveness and flexibilityThe Professional Development course is focused around the development of competencies strongly identified with leadership behaviours. Personal effectiveness in planning and organising will be addressed through continuous learning and reflection on practice. Effective teamwork and an early focus on exploring the characteristics of high performing teams is the first topic covered in detail within PD (this starts pre-arrival with the completion of the Belbin team roles online assessment). This focus is viewed as critical in order to equip the students with a strong understanding of teamwork dynamics, invaluable in many other aspects of the MBA programme where group based assessment is widely used.Assertiveness and flexibility are developed throughout the course and form 2 key elements of the Emotional Intelligence assessment (EQ diagnostic) which each student will complete as part of this course with follow up 1:1 coaching and feedback being provided.Research and Enquiry:  critical thinking; independent researchStudents are directed towards a wide range of reading resources.

    "summary": "The course aims to equip participants with the adequate tools and principles to design effective governance systems and procedures (both formal and informal) in the context of major programmes, which are characterised by a high degree of complexity and uncertainty. Participants will develop a critical attitude towards common and conventional forms of governance based on the ideals such as alignment, agreement and shared objectives, overcome an unjustified faith in the power of incentives to orient people's behaviour and acquire skills on how to engage project and programme team members, make them explore, debate and deliberate on complex matters which are difficult to be quantified. They will also gain a critical understanding of risk management and develop alternative forms of delivering programmes in risky environments.",
    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionThe course will provide a critical understanding of current governance systems and practices to (including board composition) to equip managers with practical tools to govern ambiguity, complexity and the management of unknown-unknowns in decision-making processes. It draws on theories developed in organisation theory, science and technology studies, and rhetoric blending them in ways that equip students to manage governance challenges in formal and informal settings.At the end of the course, participants are expected to:-Understand the limitations of rational-choice approaches in designing governance systems and be able to implement alternative forms which prove effective in managing risk in major programmes;-Critically assess the use in practice and limitations of corporate governance models and whether they are adequate or not to manage risk and uncertainty in major programmes;-To design formal and informal incentive systems that drive behaviours that are coherent with the degree of uncertainty of major programmes;-Explore the informal aspects of governance systems and practices, including the design of space facilities and meeting rooms;-Be aware of the organisational, political and social role that performance measurement and risk management systems play when governing major programmes.Outline ContentThe first sessions are dedicated to introduce the overall themes of the course, its structure, the role of the participants in class and, above all, the approach followed in treating issues of governance under situations of risk and uncertainty, especially in relation to large organisations and megaprojects. It will help participants to deconstruct their common understanding of project and programme management in order to elaborate alternative forms of governance systems and practices.These sessions are then followed by the discussion and operationalisation of principles which will help design governance systems that will serve as instrument of mediation of tensions, exploration of uncertainties, and engagement. Specifically, we will look at how governance systems and practices can act as effective communication and integration tools, leading to a more effective management of risk and uncertainty.The remaining sessions of the course will explore how to build effective governance systems (including board composition and working) in situations of ambiguity and uncertainty and help participants to develop a critical attitude towards corporate governance approaches that underestimate the role of organisational politics and contextual variables in decision-making in organisations.Student Learning ExperienceThe course combines traditional lecturing, with case study discussion and workshops with group work and peer learning.The course requires students to prepare the cases to be discussed before class. It is envisaged that each case requires two hours of preparation.The course is run more along the lines of an executive education course than a conventional MSc class. This is in line with recent innovations in the delivery of business education at the post-graduate level which sees the increasing importance of group activities within settings that are more similar to a workshop than a traditional front lecture. The combination of lecturing with supervised workshop and outside class work also enables an effective combination of abstract academic knowledge with the enhancement of practical skills. More generally, a good combination of lecturing and active student participation avoids loss of attention and helps focusing.",

This course will consider these principles in the management of all types project with particular emphasis on engineering projects, with respect to the project's life-cycle, the parties involved, planning, estimating, risk management, contract management, and project control. The course will examine the context of these themes through the development of a project execution plan based on a real project.",
    "course_description": "This course takes a managerial approach to project management. Many of the tools and techniques used to run projects in the modern context have been around for some time and there is a large body of professional knowledge that captures project management practice; for example through the AMP, PMI and PRINCE2 methodology. However there are many instances of project failure, many of which are reported in the national press.This course aims to make students aware of the commonly available tools used to run projects are, so the course introduces project lifecycle, stakeholder management, planning and control, estimating, risk management and closing projects down as subjects. However the course takes a reflective look at these approaches and asks students to consider whether what makes some projects successful and others not. If these tools have been around for such a long time, why are projects so risky and prone to cost overruns, expanded timescales and a failure to deliver against the stated objectives? If we can understand this we can learn from project failure and build better and more robust practice.SyllabusProject life-cycles;Activity planning and programming;Cost planning and estimation;Risk management;Contract management;Project control.Student Learning ExperienceThe course will be delivered over an intensive one-week period and will include a mix of lectures, seminars, practical sessions and guest speakers.

In addition, they will develop team management and leadership skills.",
    "course_description": "Project management and business analysis represent two elements that are key to the success of any business endeavour. Project managers are in charge of ensuring that a project is completed on time and within the planned budget. Business analysts must focus on the product of the project ensuring that it meets the needs of the key stakeholders.In this course, we introduce the project management life cycle and we compare selected state-of-the-art life cycle models for effective project management, such as traditional, agile and extreme project management; we also introduce selected state-of-the-art tools for effective project management, such as PERT and CPM.In addition, we provide an overview of selected business analysis activities that are encountered throughout the life of a project, these include stakeholder analysis, requirement analysis, risk analysis, business process and data analysis. For these, we introduce a toolbox of state-of-the-art business analysis tools such as user story mapping, use case diagrams, business process diagrams etc.Operating within a given budget necessarily imposes choices in terms of which stakeholder requests should be given priority. Project managers and business analysts must therefore coordinate their plans to ensure that budget is not exceeded, and key stakeholders are satisfied.Furthermore, as the project progresses, delays and other unforeseen events may impose a sudden re-planning of on-going activities. The exact nature of this re-planning should also be defined in concert. In some cases, reaching a consensus in the project team may constitute an extremely challenging task. To deal with these issues, we illustrate the basics of group dynamics and strategies that a team can adopt to work together effectively.The objective of this course is then to:1. provide an introduction to established project management and business analysis techniques, such as traditional, agile and extreme project management;2. illustrate selected state-of-the-art tools typically adopted in the context of project management and business analysis;3. illustrate group dynamics issues typically encountered in the context of project management. Introduce a number of established techniques and inventories that can be used to analyse and deal with these issues;4. let students familiarize with the above project management and business analysis tools and techniques in the context of a relatively small-scale project that will be developed by teams of 4 to 5 people in a short time frame of 6 weeks. The topic of the project is open and it must be agreed at the beginning of the course. Lecturers will provide a portfolio of possible projects, but students may decide to develop their own project independently. It should be emphasized that group work in this course represents an 'end'. The outcome of the project is not important per se - in principle the project may even not succeed - what will be assessed is the ability of a team to manage a project life cycle.Beside the 20 hours of content delivery, students will spend approximately 97 hours working on a project in groups of 4/5 people; up to 6 of these hours will be supervised by a lecturer. During these 6 hours, which may take the form of short coaching sessions of 20 or 30 minutes, one of the lecturers will join the group and will provide feedback on specific issues raised or on group activities.We expect students to spend approximately 50 hours on preparatory readings before their lectures. They will also have to spend 25 hours preparing for a written exam.",

    "course_description": "Behavioural finance recognises that our abilities to make complex investment decisions are limited and that we can improve our performance as investors and fund managers by recognising the biases and errors of judgment to which all of us are prone. The elective discusses what we know about the psychology of financial decision-making and explores the behaviour of both individual investors and finance professionals.This course is intended to complement other finance courses that are mainly based on the traditional paradigm which assumes that investors and managers are generally rational. We aim to examine how the insights of behavioural finance theories shed light on the behaviour of individual investors and finance professionals in the context of investment and corporate finance decision-making. We also explore the possibility to improve investment performance by recognising the cognitive biases and applying appropriate de-biasing techniques.SyllabusIntroduction to behavioural finance; Formal overview of investor psychologyOverconfidence and investment decisionsDisposition effect; Risk perceptionsProspect theory; Decision frames and mental accountingFamiliarity and representativenessBehavioural portfolio managementSocial interactions and investing; HerdingEmotions and investment decisionsRecent topics in behavioural finance; Psychology in the mortgage crisisSelected topics in behavioural corporate financeStudent Learning ExperienceThe learning occurs primarily through reading and thinking about the papers or chapters of books recommended and discussion in class. This reading is supported by the programme of ten lectures, in each of which an overview of the topic is presented and the findings of a number of relevant papers are reviewed in some detail. Students are required to write a report. All students are expected to participate actively in class discussion.  Learning takes place in four stages.  Prior to each session you are required to complete the reading assignments given.  During the session, the lecture slides will be used to focus the discussion and to help to summarise key issues. As the structure of the elective is designed to be cumulative, you will be expected to bring your learning and insights from previous sessions to bear on subsequent sessions  You will bring together and test out your understanding of the issues discussed in the course during the lecture.",

By providing a thorough background in the building blocks of programming and its applications, this course aims to provide non-technical profiles with the necessary basics to be mature in a programming environment.Outline Content:- An introduction to programming concepts: differences between programming languages, computer compiling, data types, programming styles, and programming building blocks- Programming constructs: data structures (including numpy and panda), programming control flow, functions, basic algorithms- More advanced programming concepts: use of APIs and live data sources in CSV and JSON, data visualisation and User Experience (UX), automated testing, Agile programming practices- Business applications: a study on a range of business problems from statistics and operations research to illustrate the conceptsStudent Learning Experience:Teaching will take the form of class lectures, and lab sessions. Since programming and software engineering are a real learning-by-doing topic, the concepts and methods discussed during the lectures will be illustrated during the lectures and transformed into Python exercises for the Labs, which will help you to develop your skillset gradually. Weekly assignments will introduce various topics one at a time, but will gradually become more difficult as they start combining different concepts. Nevertheless, they provide iterative feedback on weekly basis and engage students to keep up with the course. The final individual assignment combines various programming topics into business problems, for which a solution needs to be provided or extended.Tutorial/seminar hours represent the minimum total live hours - online or in-person - a student can expect to receive on this course.

It explores the nature of designed and co-designed services, the relationship between design and delivery, and situates delivery within service ecosystems to analyse the complexity and dynamism of service production and management.  It introduces students to the key concept of 'value'.",
    "course_description": "This course will introduce you to the most important aspects of service management across different industries and economies, following a service-dominant logic of business. Particular attention will be paid to the role of the customer in the service experience, i.e. co-production.Services make up over 75% of the UK economy, with similar trends across the industrialised and developing/emerging nations within the global economy. Amidst rapid technological change, digital services are becoming a key element of modern business and entrepreneurship, and drivers of economic development.Yet, there are major challenges to, and opportunities for, effective services management: firstly, services are a heavily heterogeneous field, ranging from culture and leisure to hospitality, retail, professional and financial services; while this provides fertile ground for services innovation across sectors, managers have a tendency to over-emphasise differences and 'uniqueness' within their on services areas. Secondly, an orthodox product-dominant modus of management prevails within most organisations and within business education; service-dominant theories, such as co-creation and co-production of value in services, provide managers with the opportunity to differentiate themselves and their organisations.The course will provide participants an understanding of:1. The diversity and importance of the service sector.2. The nature of services, emphasising their production and consumption/use characteristics.3. The relationship between 'service' and 'services'.4. The role of service users in service production through the processes of co-creation, co-production and co-design.5. The complexity of the service production process and the various actors involved within complex service ecosystems.6. The basic concepts of 'value creation' and 'value destruction'.7. The rise of digital services and AI and the associated opportunities and threats.",

Lectures will introduce the student to the main aspects of running a simulation project, and then proceed to discuss selected details such as input and output data analysis. During computer workshops, students will learn and use a commercial simulation package, and focus on Discrete Event Simulation modelling and analysis of simple examples. Later lectures and classes will introduce other simulation methods, including Agent-Based Simulation, System Dynamics and hybridised approaches where multiple methods are jointly employed within the same modelling effort. In this context, introductory tutorials will be provided of software with such capabilities. All simulation software packages employed in the course are commercial and widely used in industry. The individual project coursework will give students an opportunity to put their learning of simulation modelling and analysis techniques to the test, while working on a realistic/real simulation project.",
    "course_description": "This course deals with the various aspects that are related to the planning and running of a simulation project, within the broader context of Prescriptive Analytics and, more generally, Business Analytics. Of all simulation methods available, the course will focus on 'Discrete Event Simulation', the most widely used of them all. The basics of Probability and Statistics that are needed to successfully apply simulation are, albeit already covered in Semester 1 courses, briefly reminded to the student in the earlier sessions of this course. The reason is that those basics need to be put in the context of simulation modelling and analysis, something which requires a partial shift in mindset from the part of the student, in the way they think about basic techniques such as those for building confidence intervals. The course then covers all main aspects related to the inclusion of random (stochastic) elements in simulation models, namely: random number generation, random variate generation and input data analysis. Finally, the course discusses techniques for the analysis of output data from simulation runs, including the analysis of a single system and, more importantly, the comparison of multiple system alternative configurations in order to choose the 'best' course of action for a given Business Analytics problem.Outline Content- Discrete Event Simulation modelling- Steps in a sound simulation study- Random Input in Simulation Modelling- Analysis of Simulation Output for a Single System- Analysis of Simulation Output: Multiple Systems Comparisons- Design and Analysis of simulation experiments- Validation, Verification and Credibility of simulation models and analysesStudent Learning ExperienceEach week's workload will be subdivided in portions. A small amount of short readings will also be provided as either compulsory short readings or additional material for those students who want to deepen their knowledge of certain aspects of the subject. All teaching materials are meant for daily consumption by students, following either a self-imposed pace and timeline or, as strongly recommended, an agenda proposed directly by the course organiser. On completion of the computer workshop material, which is based on simplified examples to foster learning of the technical components of the subject, students will begin to work on their individual coursework project. This will consist of a real/realistic simulation analytics project, either involving an actual client or, alternatively (on a year by year basis), based on a previous real-world project that has been simplified in a way to make it manageable for completion within the time available.",

    "summary": "Real life decision problems are often too complicated to be modelled by e.g., mathematical tools. Even if they are modelled, these type of problems are often intractable and extremely challenging to solve. In recent years, the emergence of soft computing as an alternative way of solving problems in areas such as optimisation has attracted attentions from both academics and practitioners. This course offers alternative approaches to solve complex problems which could otherwise be difficult to solve by traditional techniques. It aims at training students in the field of Soft Computing with emphasis on uncertainty modeling (e.g., Bayesian Networks) and approximation (e.g., heuristics, metaheuristics ,hyperheuristics and evolutionary computations) to address decision making problems in business. Variety of applications will be examined including transportation, logistics and fleet management. The course further aim is to enhance students understanding of the critical nature of designing and/or selecting appropriate methods for solving complex decision problems. It provides opportunities for students to learn from each other, from practitioners in the field, and from the latest theoretical and applied research in the field.",
    "course_description": "This course has been designed around two main topics of approximation techniques and Bayesian modelling. At the beginning of the course, a project will be introduced in the area of location analysis or logistics. Students are expected to work on the project individually and as a member of a group during the term time.Outline ContentThe first part of the course begins with an introduction to soft computing followed by a brief discussion on basic approximation techniques such as CLS. Built upon this introduction, the advanced techniques e.g., meta-heuristics, evolutionary computation and hyper-heuristics will be discussed in the following weeks. In the second part pf the course, Bayesian Networks (BNs) and its applications to Business Analytics are discussed. The focus will be on how to design a BN and how to perform inference analysis on a hypothesis of interest.Student Learning ExperienceStudents are expected to learn basic concepts and theories from lectures. Working on their individual and group assignment during the term time, students will learn how to apply the concepts and theories learned in the lectures to solve a complex business problem such as the one described in their assignment brief.",

It adopts a strategic focus and considers the nature and scope of marketing in society, the need for a customer orientation and role of segmentation, targeting and positioning, the management of the marketing mix (comprising products, prices, promotion, distribution, physical evidence, process and people).The course is designed to introduce students to key marketing concepts,  ideas and tools . Students are required to engage with the recorded lecture material and associated readings and support materials. Synchronous sessions will be made available to reflect on the  recorded lecture material associated readings, introduce practical exercises and to collectively discuss extended case studies as a means of critically examining  marketing concepts and applications introduced in lectures. Cases cover a number of different sectors and organisations . Students are expected to engage with the materials and independent learning and reflection is encouraged. The course assessment is due at the end of the course and the individual assessment will focus on a contemporary strategic marketing challenge.SyllabusIntroduction to MarketingUnderstanding Buyer BehaviourMarketing Strategy and STPBranding Products and Services (inc NPD)Strategic PricingDistribution ChannelsTheory of Brand  CommunicationsCampaign PlanningCommunications TacticsStudent Learning ExperienceThis course offers a mixture of prerecorded online lectures, associated readings,  vignettes, video presentations, and applied case studies. Key marketing concepts are presented in prerecorded lectures, and examples, including links to more applied work  illustrate how these ideas have been applied in practice. The lectures are supported with directed reading and students have the opportunity to raise issues in synchronous sessions which are then  recorded. Students are encouraged to reflect on their own business experience and bring this to the synchronous discussions around course materials and case analysis. Shared peer experience is facilitated through smaller breakout sessions in the asynchronous sessions. Recommended readings support independent learning and allow for further critique and exploration of relevant theories and concepts. Workshops are provided to support the assignment and students encouraged to form their own independent study groups. The assignment is designed to encourage students to reflect on concepts introduced in the course as a way to analyse a contemporary strategic marketing challenge.",

    "summary": "How do we move from our current trajectory to a low-carbon future? What government strategies are available to tackle climate change? How can a Mission-Led approach mitigate climate change?Power and politics are central to understanding the delivery of strategy. This course adopts a power and politics perspective from Organisation and Management theory to examine the strategy process. It asks why some actions aimed at reducing carbon emissions happen while others are kept off the agenda and how governments can achieve net zero.A unique feature of this strategy course is its focus on organised politics, politicians and government practice. It examines national politics and how government and politics work from a strategic perspective. It explores strategy and inter-governmental relations, specifically through international summits and gatherings aimed at reaching agreements on lowering carbon emissions. More generally, insights from the course will help furnish participants with a broader perspective of the strategy and leadership play in confronting climate change. We investigate a Mission-based approach to policy making.",
    "course_description": "There are four parts to this course:1. A focus on theories of strategy, power and politics.2. An examination of how organised politics functions within the UK.3. A focus on intergovernmental summits relating to mitigating climate change.4. An examination of Mission Led thinking for tackling climate change.We begin the course by exploring prominent theories of power and politics from within Management & Organisation Theory. Stewart Clegg observed, 'If we are to change the world, we need to change power relations. Before we can change the world, then we must understand how that world was made, and that requires substantial engagement with the role that conceptions of power have played in its making' (Clegg 2023: 31).We then focus on the UK political process. We follow a lifecycle approach, commencing with a political leader seeking power and concluding with their departure from office. The rationale for this is to understand the temporal dynamics of strategy rather than being restricted to the 'here and now'. Our analysis of political leaders will concentrate on their leadership style and how they create their teams around them, a crucial skill in any organisational context. We examine the political styles of leaders such as Gordon Brown, Barack Obama and Nicola Sturgeon. Why do some political leaders succeed while others fail? Why do some strategies achieve their objectives while others fail? The course will engage critically with these questions. It will specifically address issues of climate-based policy.We move from national to international politics to examine strategy and power at global climate summits, such as COP. We explore the different interests in framing the discussions and agreed actions at international meetings. How can we make sense of the political actors and 'behind the scenes' activities that determine the process and outcomes of local, national, and international legislation and agreements? We draw on political analytic approaches to understand net zero's micro- and macro-level politics.  The course assesses Mission Led Innovation as a means of tackling climate change. It concludes by exploring how to navigate to a better future.Outline contentThis course will cover the following topics:1. Introduction to the Course: Organisations, Power and Politics.2. Dimensions of Power3. Political Leaders4. In Power: The Art of the Possible.5. Politics and the Climate.6. Political Legacies7. International Climate Summits8. Mission Led Innovation and Climate Change9.  Political Pathways to HopeStudent Learning ExperienceThe course will involve lectures and interactive learning experiences such as case analyses, text-based group discussions, guest talks etc.  As part of the course, we will visit the Scottish Parliament.There will be a live case study, where participants will study a real life strategy / political problem.",

This course explores aspects of sustainability with the goal of developing a more nuanced and contextualised understanding from three perspectives: i) global institutions, ii) scientific research, and iii) industry trends. Through this course, students will develop a forward-looking view to sustainability as a core strategic topic around which industries, firms and other organizations must compete, contend, and collaborate. This conceptual mapping of the sustainability terrain provides a foundation for moving onto more in-depth topics.",
    "course_description": "This course consists of three parts. Each provides a view of the field of sustainability from three levels of scale and context. We begin with an examination of the global institutions and frameworks that are today shaping the field and public discourse. Next, we explore concepts, theories and evidence-bases that constitute the science of sustainability. Finally, we develop an understanding of how the science and institutions of sustainability influence industry trends as well as risks and opportunities for firms and organizations across all sectors.Part 1: The Science of Sustainability-Planetary Boundaries-Carbon Literacy-Climate SciencePart 2: Global Institutions and Frameworks-COP (UN Climate Change Conferences)-SDG (UN Sustainable Development Goals)-SBTi (Science Based Targets Initiative)-ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance standards)Part 3: Industry Trends-Just Transition-Circular Economy-Degrowth-Clean Energy",

    "summary": "The course provides an in-depth exploration of sustainability as it relates to boardroom issues, discussions, interactions, composition, and decisions. It considers what is meant by Â¿sustainabilityÂ¿ in different contexts and why this matters. The course accepts and embraces the tensions that can exist when such issues reach the boardroom, accepting that simple solutions are rarely available.",
    "course_description": "Academic Description:While sustainability has traditionally been approached as a discrete issue for business, it is increasingly recognised as a strategic, interconnected issue which impacts all elements of business practice, decision-making and (in many cases) success. As such, sustainability has become a Board-level issue. However, the ability to understand discrete sustainability issues, integrate them into a more strategic understanding of the business, and predict future impacts and appropriate pathways is lacking around many Boardroom tables. This demonstrates how sustainability is at the heart of Board-level discussions, and provides students with the knowledge, competence, and confidence to have effective discussions of sustainability at this level.Outline Content:The course comprises three themed blocks: context and concepts; strategic dimensions; application. Context and concepts provides a background to the role of boards and the global challenges businesses are facing, followed by a definition (to the extent possible) of sustainability, its iterations over time, and the key issues of planetary boundaries and social foundations. Strategic dimensions delves deeply into the manifestations of sustainability at the board level typically relating to strategy or governance. Application sees the students apply their learnings and readings to a simulated board discussion on sustainability issues, before engaging in a discussion which envisages different hypothetical futures and the roles and expectations of boards in relation to these.Student Learning Experience:This course will be taught with lectures and discussions adopting an intensive focus on specific topics across three weekends. Students will be expected to arrive having completed the pre-reading/ watching and be ready to contribute to discussions and debate. This will increase across the weekends until the final morning session applies the learning with a simulated board discussion of sustainability issues. As such, students should expect an interactive and engaged experience, in which they demonstrate their ability to tackle the complexity of the various topics through their contributions to discussion and debate. Throughout the course, students and the lecturer will discuss how best to structure (if at all) the final afternoon session on the future of sustainability. Students will take on a co-creation role for their learning. The whole course, and these final weekend in particular, provide a chance for the students to discuss sustainability in a collegial, interactive, and proactive manner.",

    "summary": "Finance theory and practice has been developed in the context of listed equities or public equity markets. The availability of vast databases of historic financial information has facilitated the empirical analysis and testing of finance theory. We can observe a falling number of IPOs and listed companies. VC/PE are becoming an increasingly important alternative to public capital markets and merit investigation based on its increasing size and importance as a source of equity capital for businesses, but also because of the unique characteristics of the market compared to other sources of equity financing. The private equity market and its investment process operate in a distinctly different manner to public equity. Building on students' knowledge gained during courses taken in semester 1, this course will aim to provide students with an experience of the venture capital and private equity process, exploring and analysing the perspectives of those who select high risk investments and of those entrepreneurs who use the services of this industry. We shall work with cases from early stage entrepreneurs and with prospective investors with the expectations to leverage the networks of the instructors to host founders and VC/PE fund managers for guest lectures/seminars.",
    "course_description": "This area of finance is highly specialised, and practitioners strive to operate to international norms, but with a wide distribution of regional variance, and hence the course should give students an additional field within which to apply the tools and understanding provided by many of the quantitative modules.The objective is to move beyond a descriptive account of the mechanics of the private equity and venture capital industry (though this is important given the unique organisation and contract structures of the market) so that students gain a more complete understanding of why and how the industry operates as it does. These questions can be answered best through the prism of finance theory. We shall identify and discuss the critical stages in the engagement between entrepreneurs soliciting investment, and the VC/PE firms that select, invest in, nurture, and often refinance fast growing new companies or later-stage ventures. Regional and national policies often shape the pathway by which entrepreneurs acquire investment, and the conditions placed on ownership of shares in the new companies.",

The course will review the history and development of design thinking through 4 paradigms, leading to an understanding of designing for experience through 4 orders - visual, material, service and system (Buchanan, 1992; Golsby-Smith, 1996).  This approach is applied and tested in practical work, understanding business models as designable constructions.",
    "course_description": "The first half of the course introduces you to the theoretical backgrounds underlying applied approaches to design thinking in a lecture and seminar format. A history of research regarding design activity is outlined, through two fundamental paradigms of thinking about design-as-method in the 1960s through to the design-as-knowledge application and expertise through the 1980s (Dorst 2006; Dorst & Dijkhuis 1995). The lectures will then introduce concepts of design-for-experience and interaction design, leading to the fundamental approach to the basic understanding of Design Thinking (Martin, 2009). The lectures conclude with the introduction of designing for complexity, going beyond interactions between users and artefacts towards experience and introduces the 4 orders of design: text/image; objects; services; and systems (Buchanan 1992) and, going forward, pursue the notion that designing is a form of practice involving placement. Throughout, special emphasis is placed upon understanding designing as both an iterative and generative activity, focusing on the fundamental practice of prototyping.The second half of the course provides the opportunity to engage practical, team-based exercises that will engage you to design and develop, through a project of intervention, an alternative model to an existing product, service, process or business model, prototype your developments and your their findings, leading to an individual case study as a final submission interrogating the value of design methods and design thinking in an entrepreneurship and innovation context.",
