    "summary": "The course is an introduction to the study of ancient historiography, itself a crucial element of the study of history, past and present. I.e. the course encourages students to analyse a good number of ancient historians and histories, especially the key figures and key texts in the development of the practice we call history, including Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Polybius, Livy, Cassius Dio, Tacitus, Ammianus Marcellinus, and others. The selection of authors to be studied in any one year depends on the research expertise of staff teaching the course so as to allow maximum scope for cutting-edge teaching based on new research undertaken by staff at Edinburgh.",
    "course_description": "The course offers focussed study of key ancient historians in lectures and tutorials, covering both Greek and Roman historians, and a period that stretches roughly one millennium.The authors covered on the course will vary each year, however a typical class schedule may look like this:W1 History and Historiography: Definitions, Connections and GenreW2 HerodotusW3 ThucydidesW4 Xenophon and Alexander historiansW5 PolybiusW6 LivyW7 JosephusW8 TacitusW9 BiographyW10 Cassius DioW11 ConclusionsStudents should thus gain a sound understanding of the creation and evolution of the writing of history, and in particular a clear understanding of the beginnings of the practice of history writing - and thus of the foundations of the modern practice.In studying important historical writings and their authors, students will explore the concept of 'history' in comparing different ancient and modern approaches to this concept. Students will thus be challenged to consider and reconsider their own and others' assumptions of what history is and how history is (to be) written.In sum: whilst the past remains unchanged, history is always changing, and this course is concerned to examine how the past and present have been continuously interpreted and reinterpreted in antiquity through the exercise that we call history. It explores the sources and methods by which history is constructed in antiquity, looking at the roles different types of evidence can play, as well as how different historians aim to change the history of a particular geography, period or topic.This course builds upon the first year survey courses in Classics with the intention to deepen students' understanding of ancient history as well as their understanding of how history is written.",

    "summary": "This course looks at the political, cultural and religious translation undergone by the Roman empire - and with it classical civilisation - in Late Antiquity (ca. 300-ca. 800). How did the monolithic late Roman state give way to Germanic kingdoms in western Europe, and develop into the Greek-speaking Byzantine empire of the eastern Mediterranean? And how did the monotheistic religions, Christianity and Islam, establish themselves and impact politics and everyday life across the Mediterranean and Near East?",
    "course_description": "The period now known as Late Antiquity, from ca. 300-800, was traditionally disdained as one of decadence, and ignored for falling between the ancient and medieval worlds. But in the last forty years, Late Antiquity has become viewed as a period in its own right and as one of the most exciting and dynamic areas of historical study. Late Antiquity sees new powerbrokers - barbarian generals, court eunuchs, bishops and holy men and women - and profound changes: above all, the transformation of the Roman empire in the west to Germanic kingdoms and in the east to the Greek-speaking Byzantine state, and the spread and political establishment of Christianity and, later, Islam.The course is divided into roughly three areas: it opens by studying the late Roman empire of the fourth and fifth centuries, with themes including social relations in a sharply hierarchical and unequal society, the growth of Christianity, and the external and internal tensions which eventually led to the end of the western empire. Thereafter the course alternates between west and east, looking at the development of the post-Roman west down to the age of Charlemagne and at the vicissitudes of the Byzantine empire through the age of Justinian, the great war against Persia, the Arab invasions, and Iconoclasm. The central themes of the course are understanding the political transformations of the period in relationship to profound social, cultural, and religious change, and preparing students for the many more specialised courses on the period available at honours level.",

This course focuses on the world Alexander created but did not live to see; historians call it the 'Hellenistic World'.",
    "course_description": "A series of wars between Alexander's generals divided Alexander's empire into three powerful kingdoms, based in Macedon, Syria, and Egypt. The former subjects of Persia now found themselves ruled by Greco-Macedonian kings. But it was not simply a change of ruler. Greeks arrived in their thousands to inhabit these newly-acquired territories, living in the new Greek cities founded by Alexander and his successors, centres of Greek culture in an alien land.In exploring the Hellenistic World we will be concentrating especially on the years from the death of Alexander down to the end of the third century and ranging over the whole eastern Mediterranean. The course would be expected to cover some or all of the following themes:   1. Alexander and his legacy;   2.The Successors;   3. The Ptolemies and Egypt;   4. The Seleucids and Asia;   5. Macedon and Greece;   6. Kings and ruler cult;   7. Cities (esp. Alexandria);   8. Celtic invasions;   9. Ethnicity;   10. Women and Families;   11. Literature and Patronage;   12.

    "summary": "By far the most detailed account of the late Roman state and its emperors comes from the history of Ammianus Marcellinus, completed in ca. 390 and covering in the surviving books the years AD 353 to 378 and the emperors Constantius II, Julian, Jovian, Valentinian I, and Valens. This course focuses on an in-depth study of Ammianus' work and the Roman world he describes.",
    "course_description": "The course offers an in-depth study of a historian notable both for brilliant writing and his acute and tendentious perspective on a crucial period of Roman history. Ammianus Marcellinus' Res Gestae originally covered the history of the Roman empire from the accession of Nerva onwards, but only the books covering his own times (AD 353-378) survive. Ammianus' work is unique, but he himself exemplifies the diversity and mobility of the international elite of the Roman empire post-Constantine: a pagan serving under Christian emperors, a Greek-speaker who wrote a Latin history, a Syrian who travelled throughout the Roman world as a high ranking officer and retired to Rome. Thanks to Ammianus, the history of the third quarter of the fourth century AD is one of the best attested periods of Roman history, and the course will explore both what Ammianus can tell us about the Roman world of his time and how he can mislead us. The course will provide insights into themes including the workings of the late Roman state, the Christianisation of Roman society, and the place of classical literature and historical memory in Roman identity. The course will develop students' knowledge of a fascinating period and their skills in political and social history and in reading elaborate literary texts in their historical context.",

Students will investigate a range of evidence, including law court speeches, tombstones, vase paintings, domestic architecture, philosophical treatises, manumission inscriptions, etc. to gain a varied understanding of the ways in which the peculiar institution manifested itself in Greek society. Students will explore the relationship between slavery and other forms of unfree labour as well as between slavery and freedom, slavery and citizenship, and slavery and democracy. Like its 'partner', the Honours course on 'Roman Slavery', this course springs directly from the course organiser's main research interest: the study of slavery in classical antiquity.",

Likewise, the course is an ideal introduction to the study of slavery as a historical phenomenon, and the course is therefore explicitly comparatist.",

    "summary": "For the Ancient Greeks, war was the main theme of history. For us, the Trojan, Persian and Peloponnesian Wars are common ways into the Greek world. But what did war mean to them? How did it work? And was there a 'Greek' way of war?",
    "course_description": "From poems and pictures to historical writing, war dominates the surviving sources for the Ancient Greek world. It was both a common experience and an existential threat to all inhabitants of this world; it affected all aspects of Greek life and thought. To understand Greek warfare, then, is to understand the Greeks better.This course will explore how war fits into Greek society and culture in the Archaic and Classical periods. It will examine the way in which a set of martial values - courage, self-reliance, sacrifice for the community - produced sometimes strange military institutions and approaches to armed conflict. It will explore the roles of women, enslaved people, and migrants, not just as victims or resources to be exploited, but as agents in their own right. It will also consider differences between parts of the Greek world, and changes over time, to test the belief that there was ever a single, distinct 'Greek' method to the madness of war.",

The course will focus on Persian history of the period 559-330 BCE, a time when Iran ruled the biggest and empire the world had ever seen, occupying an area that stretched from Ethiopia to Afghanistan. The course will concentrate on the reigns of the Achaemenid monarchs (including Cyrus the Great, Darius the Great and Xerxes), examining their political, socio-cultural and military achievements and on life at court. Students will be required to evaluate Iranian, Near Eastern, Egyptian and Greek sources as evidence for the period. Other themes will include the language of the Persians, life in the provinces, women in Persian society, art and architecture, religion, and the use made of the Achaemenid period in more recent Iranian history. The course will of necessity engage with textual and visual materials. Students will be asked to engage with theoretical approaches to Near Eastern history such as Orientalism.",

    "course_description": "This course is intended as an introduction to the uses of comparative history in the study of ancient societies, specifically with regards to ancient slavery, a sub-field of the discipline in which there have been many notable comparative studies. Each class is based around a particular theme related to the study of slavery, and examines ancient evidence/scholarly debates alongside evidence from and scholarship on a different area of history -- usually from a single society. These weekly comparative case studies are intended to cover large stretches of human history. They range from the Middle East and Africa to Korea and (most frequently) the modern Americas. Alongside articles and book chapters, weekly readings will include a brief overview of the political and social history of each society used as a comparative case study each week. Though not primarily a course on classical reception, the influence of ancient texts on later slave systems, particularly in the Americas, will also occasionally be touched on in class.Of the skills students will develop on this course listed in the Learning Outcomes and Graduate Attributes sections below, instruction in and experience with comparative history is worth highlighting here. This course will also provide students with some cursory information about ancient slavery in its wider historical context and allow them a unique opportunity to explore (if briefly) other areas of history outside the ancient Mediterranean.",

The courts also heard cases about citizenship, maritime trade, mining contracts, quarrels between neighbours, treason and murder. The preserved speeches of the Attic orators delivered in court cover all aspects of life in Athens and are one of our richest sources of evidence for life in the Greek world. Through close reading of a selection of speeches of the orators the students will familiarize themselves, and learn to engage with, the social and economic reality of classical Athens, while at the same time acquiring skills necessary to understand and exploit challenging course material.

Murena on a bribery charge, his later defence of an alleged conspirator P. Sulla, and the historian Sallust's account of the conspiracy written twenty years afterwards. In addition to supplying historical information, these sources also represent the best and most exciting oratory and historiography of the late republic.The course will develop students' ability to interpret Roman history of the late republic through detailed study of a particularly full range of sources while also developing their understanding and appreciation of some of the best known classics of Roman literature.",

What were they?Drawing on work from legal anthropology and sociology on Alternative Dispute Resolution, this course will examine precisely that question: how did historical agents resolve their disputes beyond recourse to state courts? A variety of processes will be examined, ranging across the more formal (arbitration) to self-help. Through examination of a range of evidence, we shall consider such issues as whether ADR enabled the preservation of the legal traditions of minority groups (as has often been demonstrated in modern contexts) and how methods of ADR interacted with state institutions. We shall also consider what the study of ADR might tell us about broader issues in Roman history, including the nature of Roman rule and Romanization.",

This course offers an exciting and comparative direct insight into the life of people across the Roman Empire as documented by their private written records, from Vindolanda to Oxyrhynchus, via Pompei, the Dead Sea, and Dura-Europos.",
    "course_description": "Although the Roman Empire has always captivated modern fascination with stories of Emperors, wars, aristocrats, and poets, this course will give students the chance to hear what it was really like to live in the Roman Empire from the direct voices of its inhabitants. Private written records allow a unique and fascinating insight into the different aspects of the daily life of the diverse people of the Empire and the course will focus on sources from exceptionally illustrative areas in Italy and the provinces of Britannia, Egypt, Arabia, and Syria. After the initial sessions arranged geographically that will equip students with the socio-historical compass to navigate across the subjects discussed, thematic sessions will engage with direct evidence of life across the Empire in comparative perspective, touching upon topics such as family life, wealth, religions and beliefs, military life, gender and sexuality, lifestyle, slavery, and mobility (both geographical and social). In addition to a variety of written sources in translation, such as papyri, tablets, inscriptions, and graffiti, students will also approach archaeological evidence and material culture. The course weaves together people's life experiences under Roman rule, offering an empire-wide view: students will embark on a journey in the 'global' history of daily life in the Roman Empire as an interconnected reality.",

The sequential analysis of the domains where honour was central will tackle notions of dignity, recognition, respect and subjective rights, honours for benefactors (euergetism) and for various subaltern categories (women, slaves). Finally, the course shall discuss pathological social phenomena connected to honour dynamics, such as hybris, atimia.",
    "course_description": "Everyone acknowledges that 'honour' is central to the societies and norms that assume centre stage in the greatest works of classical Greek literature and thought. Yet the concept -- both in its nature and in its pervasiveness in Greek society -- is often poorly understood. And this matters, because its ramifications are very wide indeed: from the quarrel that animates the plot of Europe's earliest work of literature to the motivations of tragic characters both male and female, major and minor, honour is at the heart of a complex of ethical values whose understanding is indispensable to the interpretation of Greek literature and thought. It underpins the self-assertion of heroes, but also the control that communities exert on heroic self-assertion. Such themes recur in myriad variations in a variety of contexts because honour is the central concept of Greek social and political life, from the society depicted in the Homeric poems, via the archaic societies that received those poems, to the developed democracy of classical Athens. From the Iliad to Athenian law, oratory, and politics 'honour' is inextricably linked not only with the pursuit of prestige in competition with others, but also with justice, self-control, and the interests of the community. In Homer, Sophocles, Aristotle, and the Attic orators not only does the notion of honour presuppose an implicit conception of rights, but terms linked to that notion can be explicitly used to articulate such a concept. Honour is the driving force in ancient Greek social interaction, in the norms and values that are expressed in relationships at both interpersonal and civic levels, and in the institutions that bind individuals to their communities. This is a history that starts with literary sources but which reaches deep into ancient Greek society. It is the history that this course aims to explore.",

How did local inhabitants react, and how did Greek and local cultures interact? What changed with the coming of Rome? Judaean interaction with imperial powers varied, from rather laid-back approaches (the Ptolemies) to the purported attempt to do away with Judaean ancestral customs (Antiochus IV). The latter event triggers the Maccabean revolt, which has dramatic and long-lasting implications. The course will introduce students to basic problems of Hellenistic history (with a focus on the Seleucid empire) by way of a particularly well-documented regional example.",

    "summary": "Underlying the most notable cultural achievements of the ancient Greeks was a dynamic economy that connected Greek communities to the wider Mediterranean world and provided the wealth and leisure on which developments in literature, philosophy, science, and art were built. This course will introduce students to the main features of this economy and its structure, studying various forms of production, exchange, and service, within the framework of the city-state.",
    "course_description": "This course will focus on the economy of the Greek city-states during the classical period (5th and 4th c BC). Starting from the economic organisation of the household and the cultivation of the countryside, it will expand its focus to non-agricultural occupations in the urban sphere and then to the networks of trade that connected the city-states, allowing the movement of a vast range of commodities. The focus on the democratic city-state and its institutions will allow students to grasp how economic activities were both enabled and constrained in order that the economy might flourish, yet without its benefits being distributed in a way contrary to the political ideals of the city-state. Political institutions in democratic cities targeted the predatory, rent-seeking activities of the elite that had been characteristic of the archaic era, and tried to retool the relationship between the people and its leaders by creating a symbiotic relationship where support of the citizenry and its recognition of the legitimacy of elite domination of major magistracies (e.g. the generalship) was paid for by onerous taxation.Whereas political institutions in democratic cities such as Athens constrained the mushrooming of economic inequality within the citizen body, the same was not true outwith the citizen body: by studying the institution of slavery, students will see how classical Greek society was parasitic upon a large population of imported foreign slaves, who performed the least pleasant tasks in the economy. The course will also go beyond democratic city-states such as Athens, looking at case studies (Sparta, Crete, Rhodes and so forth) that developed in different directions, underscoring the diversity of economic formations in the world of the city-states.",

Given the nature of the evidence, students will also learn to employ economic models to answer the questions they wish to pursue. In short, the course will enable students to make use of material that is highly diversified, ranging from archaeological remains on the one hand to inscriptions and literary sources on the other. The students will need to learn to include the full range of possible evidence into their historical arguments to achieve highly persuasive results. Given the importance of the topic - the ancient economy - the students will furthermore gain wide-reaching insights into ancient societies beyond the mere sphere of economy proper. The course is taught 'bottom up', i.e. students will first deal with the everyday realities of (household) economies - hence the course title, 'Life and Labour' - before engaging in interpretation of the ancient economy.Topics covered in class will include: the life-cycle, production, consumption, trade, farming, industries, city and country, poverty, wealth, slavery and free labour, etc.",

The course then proceeds largely chronologically, starting with early Argead rule, then moving via Philip II and Alexander the Great - the most famous rulers of Macedonia - to the Hellenistic period. The last third of the course is dedicated to the Roman conquest of Macedonia, the reorganization of the territory as a Roman province, and the social and religious history of the region under Rome.

Often this would entail an obligation to keep the cult's core ideas and rituals secret; in some cases, passing them on to non-initiates was punishable by death. For modern scholars, this veil of secrecy creates obvious problems: while many ancient authors offered their own speculations on what was going on in these cults, it is often unclear how they (and hence: we) could possibly know. For some prominent cults, we encounter wild ideas and baseless polemics, whereas for others, we hardly get any information at all. This course offers an in-depth look into what can legitimately be said about ancient mystery cults. Combining literary, archaeological and epigraphical evidence ranging from Classical Athens to Roman East Lothian, students embark on a mission to reconstruct an important aspect of ancient religious life.

We do not see such direct involvement in later authors, but we know that there was popular belief that gods were interested in human affairs, particularly in one of the most important spheres of Greek activity, war. Owing to the interaction of the gods in war and their responsibility for its outcomes, both good and ill, religious settings were appropriate public spaces for referring, through a diverse range of images and objects, to battle.This module will examine the role that the ancient Greeks of the Archaic and Classical periods believed their gods played in warfare -- both wars between Greek states and wars against barbarians, especially the Persians. We will explore the material culture of warfare, how to read images of war on vase painting and sculpture, how Greeks commemorated battles in their sanctuaries by displaying their victories in a PanHellenic or local setting, how the war-dead were treated, and how hero-cults were formed for the fallen. We will investigate how this is done at a polis and personal level. We will examine how religion influenced decisions, formed sacred topography, offered excuses and justifications for war, and how authors such as Herodotus and Thucydides portray religion in their works.

    "summary": "The one thousand years history of the Byzantine Empire was marked by continuous warfare against various enemies on various fronts. If war was a necessity for the survival and prosperity of the Eastern Roman imperial state, the question arising is how did a society imbued with Christian ideals of peace and non-violence legitimize the use of military violence as a political means and justified the conduct of war in ideological terms. The course will trace the development of eastern Roman attitudes toward war and peace from the period of the empire's Christianization up until the eve of early modernity in comparison with other medieval societies.",
    "course_description": "In this course we will explore the development of the dialectic relationship between the Christian religion and war in East Roman imperial culture. This will be approached from a comparative view-point by discussing the development of war ethics in the Christian post-Roman West and the Islamic Near East. Furthermore, we will undertake a comparison with cultures in which the relationship between religion and war was not informed by the biblical tradition. Our main goal will be to position the Byzantine war ethic within the broader discussion about a western just war tradition and to explore the differences between Eurocentric and non-Eurocentric approaches to the relationship between religion and military violence.",

The history of the region will be covered topically, though students will also develop an understanding of the changes that took place throughout the Roman period.

    "summary": "With his famous statement, Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit ('once subdued, Greece captured her ferocious conqueror'), Horace remarked how Rome, having conquered Greece, itself became captive of the Greek culture. Writing under Augustus, Horace described what was merely a result of a long process of political, cultural, and otherwise interactions between Rome and the Greek cities in the preceding centuries. This course will trace the history of Greece from the beginning of Rome's influence over the region in the early second century BC through to the later second century CE, approaching it from the angles of politics, culture, society, and religion.",
    "course_description": "It takes little effort to notice that Greece occupied a rather special place in Roman cultural imagination. Declarations of admiration and respect for the region's history and culture often resulted in the preferential treatment of a number of Greek cities under Rome, manifesting in grants of freedom, autonomy, and immunity. This attitude persisted well into the imperial period: in a letter to his friend Maximus, who had just been appointed governor of Achaia, Pliny reminded him of the special status of 'that real and pure Greece' (illa vera et mera Graecia), insisting that the incoming governor should respect the Greeks' 'antiquity, their colossal achievements, and even ... their legends' (Pliny, Ep. 8.24).This course explores the extent to which this widely articulated respect and admiration for Greece is reflected (or not) in Rome's approaches to governing the region over time. Conversely, it also investigates a variety of ways and strategies in which the Greeks negotiated their place and privileges within the Roman Empire. The history of Greece under Roman hegemony will be studied from several interrelated standpoints (diplomacy, warfare, politics, law, culture, society, and religion) through a wide selection of literary and epigraphic sources in translation. Besides developing the skills of historical and critical analysis on the basis of diverse primary source material, the students will engage with the most recent scholarship, and will be encouraged to pursue their own interests within the framework of the course.",

This came at the end of a war that began in 66 CE, at around the time of the momentous events in Rome that led to the rise of the Flavians. Indeed, this victory became vitally important to the new dynasty in Rome, who capitalized on its import to justify the new regime. But what led to the rebellion in the first place? The history of Roman-Jewish relations prior to this point appears far from a catalogue of antipathy and conflict and the reasons for such a dramatic eruption of violence remain a point of contention today.This course tackles the history of Judaea under Roman rule, concentrating on the period from Pompey's conquest of the East in 63 BCE until the momentous events of 70 CE, when the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed, never to be rebuilt. Students will become acquainted with various aspects of the history of the region: social, economic, cultural and religious.

    "summary": "This course explores the nature and consequences of migration from Italy into the wider Mediterranean at the time of Rome's increasing territorial expansion. Italians and Roman citizens who moved overseas on their own initiative frequently formed associations in their new places of residence. These associations not only facilitated economic activities between Italy and the rest of the Mediterranean by forming durable trade networks, but also enabled their members to create and express their Italian and/or Roman identity through cultural and religious practices, in a variety of non-Roman environments.",
    "course_description": "What did it mean for local communities to encompass Roman citizen settlers? How did these Romans style themselves and create their own \"expat\" identity, and how was this perceived locally? To what extent and in what ways were they different from other diaspora communities, e.g. the Jews?

    "summary": "The history of the Greeks is bound up with the Mediterranean and Black Seas: from an early period the highly indented coastline of Greece made sea travel the preferred means of travel, and the Greeks pioneered the shipbuilding technology that led to their settlements being spread widely across the Mediterranean littoral. Seamanship also played a crucial role in the defeat of the Persians at Salamis in 480 and the Athenian Empire that grew not long afterwards. This course aims to explore the Greeks' relationship with the sea through the study of environment, technology, and human knowledge.",
    "course_description": "'Like ants or frogs around a pond' - so wrote Plato (Phaedo 109), describing the inhabitants of the Mediterranean and Black Sea. The sea is a central element in Greek history. Mastery of seafaring and shipbuilding technology enabled Greek settlement to spread far beyond the confines of the Aegean; this same technology played a fundamental linking role in Greek interaction with non-Greek cultures, turning the sea from a barrier into a highway that sped goods, people, and ideas between and beyond the city-states. It also enabled the projection of power: the use of the sea for violent means enabled (e.g.) Greece's defence against the Persians to succeed, Athens' fifth-century maritime empire to be built, and Alexander's successors to compete for naval dominance of the Eastern Mediterranean. This course aims to explore how all of this worked at a practical level from the Archaic through Hellenistic periods: what was the nature of maritime technology in Greece, and how did it change over time? How did the conjunction of winds, currents, technology, and knowledge shape the pattern of Greek settlement? How did investment in maritime technology shape Greek city states - whether through the benefits of trade, or through the need to invest in expensive naval technology (and the infrastructure, both physical and fiscal, to support it) and outcompete neighbouring powers? What was life like for the many Greeks who gained their livelihood from the sea? How did maritime trade work in practice? And how did exploration by sea enlarge the mental horizons of the Greeks and their perception of the wider world?",

    "summary": "The course is an introduction to the histories of ancient Sparta and Crete. Through examining evidence from Sparta and Crete during the classical period, this course aims to go beyond an Athenocentric view of 'Greek society'.",
    "course_description": "In this course, students will encounter the complex and contradictory evidence for the fabric and character of classical Spartan society and the nature of her institutions through a close study of texts in translation. Lectures will focus upon political, social and economic institutions as well as ideologies of warfare and community, the role of women, and sexuality. Other topics include the character of slavery in Sparta (helotage), how it compares in legal terms to slavery at Athens, and its function in Sparta's political economy. Crete presents very different material for study. Though the lectures shall present the evidence of Aristotle, Ephorus and other non-Cretan writers who comment on Cretan society, the main focus will be on epigraphy and in particular the 'Great Code' of Gortyn (IC IV 72), supplemented by a selection of other Gortynian inscriptions in translation. Beyond an in-depth study of Gortynian laws on the household, family, and slavery, students will compare the example of Gortyn to the generalisations found in the literary sources which present Crete as undifferentiated (though it contained over 60 different city states, most of them independent of one another) in order to gauge the degree to which Cretan city states displayed common institutions and practices.A typical class schedule will cover the following topics:1. Introduction2. The mirage of classical Sparta and the invention of tradition (Sparta in the basic textbooks; Sparta in popular culture; invention of tradition as a subject in historiography)3. Behind the mirage: problems with our sources, with classical land tenure as a case study4. Sparta's political institutions5. Social groups and aspects of status (citizens, helots, perioikoi and other subaltern groups)6. The political economy of helotage7. The threat of helots? Revolts and management of slavery in Sparta8. Citizen military ideology in Sparta: the education system9. Spartan women: myth and reality10. Messenia and national identity11. Wealth and the power of wealth in Sparta12. Sparta: an unusual society?13. The archaic origins of Sparta's institutions14. Introduction: Plato and Aristotle on the similarity of Spartan and Cretan society (and a look at the Geography and settlement archaeology of Crete)15. Introduction to the Gortyn lawcode: formation, purpose, format16. The family and the household in Gortynian law17. Legal procedure at Gortyn18. Slavery at Gortyn19. Cretan pederasty and education20. Common institutions of the Cretans? The question of diversity21. Helotic slavery in comparative perspective: Crete, Sparta, Thessaly, Heraclea22. Review: How similar was Spartan and Cretan society?At the end of the course, students will compare Spartan and Cretan society to reflect on the similarities and differences between the two.",

Conspiracies to be examined include both well-known plots, such as the Pisonian Conspiracy against Nero, and lesser known examples, such as that by Gaetulicus against Gaius.",

    "course_description": "Roman emperors possessed and were seen to possess extraordinary personal power. But with a massive empire which took months to cross, and distant and varied subordinates with their own ambitions and agendas, emperors' room for action was always constrained and their personal survival often under threat. In the later Roman Empire (284-565), the presentation of the emperor became ever more grandiose, distant, and semi-divine; a vast and burgeoning bureaucratic state arose, and imperial patronage flowed through new channels, most notably Christian bishops. This course will look both at the individuals associated with these great changes, from Diocletian and Constantine through to Justinian, via characters like the pagan reactionary Julian and the teenage puppet Honorius; we will examine the developing elites of the period; we will look at what difference Christianity made, and at how subjects, great and humble, perceived and were expected to perceive the emperor.",

The most important dynasties were the Antigonids in Macedon, the Seleucids in Syria and the Ptolemies in Egypt. By the time of Augustus none of these kingdoms existed. Instead the Greek world was ruled from Rome and was divided up into Roman provinces. It is this transformation that is the subject of this course.",
    "course_description": "The course covers the period from the Illyrian Wars in the late third century to Pompey's defeat of the pirates and Mithridates in the mid first century BC. Themes covered will include the Roman conquest of the Greek east, the nature of Roman imperialism, the Greek reaction to Rome, the effect of eastern expansion on Rome itself. The course will use a range of source material but particular attention will be given to the contemporary Greek historian Polybius and a selection of inscriptions.  It brings together the two main strands of the study of Ancient History, the Greek and the Roman, and contributes to understanding how and why the Greek world and its culture had a significant influence on Rome. The course works well in conjunction with 'After Alexander'.",

    "course_description": "Roman imperial rulers had to deal with the very different backgrounds of their various subjects, and provincials in turn adapted or resisted the coming of Rome in a variety of ways. The situation of Jews outside of their Judaean homeland is a particularly fascinating case in point within this broader picture. Jewish communities were spread very widely across the empire, meaning that many Jews lived side by side with their pagan and later their Christian neighbours. What was the extent and nature of the impact of this on their identity? This course will provide an introduction to the sources and history of the Jewish diaspora under Rome up to c. 450 C.E., covering both the eastern and western empire, as well as the community in Rome itself. The material is rich and varied, including pagan, Jewish and Christian literature, inscriptions, papyri and of course the archaeological material. Students will consider the position and lives of Jews as a case study for the impact of empire on subject communities, but will also evaluate the extent to which we can indeed use this particular case as a representative example.",

This is a crucial period of Byzantine history, since the watershed of the year 1204 marked the end of twelve centuries of continuous centralized Roman imperial authority in the East. Therefore, it may justifiably be studied as the historical moment of the ultimate fall of Rome.",
    "course_description": "The defeat of the imperial armies by the Seljuks at the battle of Manzikert in 1071 led to the swift loss of imperial control over the largest part of Asia Minor, the empire's territorial core since the radical contraction of the East Roman world in the early seventh century. This development triggered a series of major geo- and socio-political changes in the Byzantine world, such as the emergence of various principalities or states in Asia Minor and the Balkans, the social and cultural transformation of Byzantine elite society, the phenomenon of decentralization and provincialism, and the empire's clash with western Christendom in the form of the Crusading movement. In this course we will study all these developments and will try to trace the reasons which led to the final and irreversible disintegration of Constantinople's centralized imperial authority in the year 1024.",

This course will focus on the historical, military and political significance of Julius Caesar, one of the most celebrated Roman politicians and generals, and on his impact on modern and contemporary history. The course will cover the most famous events in the career of Julius Caesar, and his role in Roman imperial politics and will end by focusing on how modern and contemporary politicians use his memory as a model and/or inspiration to enhance their reputation.",
    "course_description": "The course will primarily focus on ancient evidence on Caesar (textual and numismatics), from the Late Republic to the imperial age. It will analyse the complex and dynamic evolution of Caesar's memory and his role in Roman memory culture and political thought. We will discuss the way Republican authors (Caesar himself and Cicero) talk about Caesar and his deeds; how his memory is manipulated and processed in the Augustan age and later in the imperial age (Lucan, Petronius, Suetonius, Plutarch, Appian). The three final classes will focus on the memory of Caesar and its instrumentalisation in modern and contemporary literary (Shakespeare, Brecht) political and military discourse.In addition to the analysis of primary sources on Julius Caesar, students will become familiar with the most recent scholarship on Memory, Political and Genocide Studies. The course will also develop the skills necessary to analyse events from a historical, literary and comparative perspective. Particular attention will be dedicated to the ways a character like Caesar, often portrayed as a victor and a positive example of military leadership, was also a perpetrator of war and humanitarian crimes, particularly in relation to the Gallic Wars. Through oral group presentations (in-seminar activities) and written assessment, students will develop presentation skills as well as critical skills to analyse texts and material culture.",

The situation deteriorated, however, under Elagabalus, and was stabilised briefly under the reign of Alexander, despite his youth. The course will consider the changes that occurred in this period, militarily, socially and politically. It will involve the inter-relation of a wide variety of different types of evidence, notably literary, epigraphic and archaeological, and the development of the skills required to interpret these in the construction of a history of the Severan age.",

This course uses the life and writings of Augustine amongst other historical sources as a way into the study of a fascinating period of transformation and conflict. In this way this course offers an insight into the history of Late Antiquity with particular focus on social, cultural and religious aspects.",
    "course_description": "Through a combination of lectures and seminars students cover key themes and issues with particular focus on close reading/examination of the sources from the period.  Augustine's own works form a key focus, including most obviously the Confessions and (extracts from) the City of God. The letters, sermons and treatises of Augustine help illuminate such key issues as pagan/Christian conflict, the Donatist Schism and contemporary reaction to the Sack of Rome in 410. Further subjects covered include the ethnic, political and social divisions in North Africa, issues of religious conversion and religious coercion, barbarian invasion and cultural transformation. Augustine himself provides an obvious focus while the setting of his birth and most of his activities, Roman North Africa, is an area uniquely rich in varied source material. Alongside the writings of Augustine and his near contemporaries the course makes use of the rich archaeological record from North Africa.  In this way this course provides an advanced level look at both a key period of ancient history and an important geographical area that students may not have had an opportunity to study before.",

Recent discoveries of a remarkably sophisticated military apparatus on an astonishing scale in the late antique Persian World, in comparison with the much widely known military monuments of Rome, will provide participants with a better understanding of ancient geopolitics and the use of hard power in antiquity.",
    "course_description": "This course will explore the military forces and infrastructure of some of the ancient world's largest, most powerful and long-lived empires, those of Rome and Persia. It will cover the period from the 1st century BC to the 7th century AD.The Roman Empire was the dominant power in the Mediterranean and controlled up to the 5th century the majority of Europe's population, as well as Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt and Northern Africa. Split from the late 4th century into Western and Eastern Roman successor states, its surviving eastern half remained a dominant player on the world stage up to the first half of the 7th century.As far as Persia is concerned, the course will focus on Late Antiquity, as there is much more concrete evidence for Sasanian than for Parthian military installations. Centred on modern Iran, the Sasanian Empire (3rd-7th centuries) stretched to Mesopotamia in the west, to the western parts of the Indian Subcontinent in the east and into the Arabian Peninsula and Central Asia in the south and north. Until a few years ago, little had been known about its military infrastructure. Recent research has revealed frontier walls and defended compounds of greater dimensions than those found in the late Roman world. It now appears that the Sasanian Empire had an army, which in terms of the scale and sophistication of its military architecture, its capabilities, achievements and, probably, its numerical strength, matched or more than matched those of the most powerful states in antiquity.The course will present the evidence for the organisation of the Roman and Sasanian armies, the monuments they have left behind, and for their deployment in war. It will explore the question how they were able to expand or maintain such vast territorial empires over centuries. In contrast to the Eurocentric perspective of most courses on ancient warfare, this course will seek to demonstrate how the bipolar world of Late Antiquity was shaped by competing superpowers.",

    "summary": "Plague, warfare, and religious and cultural transformation. The roughly two hundred years from the reign of Justinian to the fall of the Umayyads could be summed up in this short sentence. It was not only a period of radical change with far-reaching historical consequences, but also of great innovations in art and architecture that has left us with some of the best-known monuments of the Near East.",
    "course_description": "This thematic course explores the late antique Near East with a focus on the period from the first half of the sixth century to the middle of the eighth century. We will examine the effects of socio-political and religious change through archaeological studies of life in urban and rural environments, technological advances, economy, infrastructure, and trade. The course will explore the sixth-century building boom in the countryside (villages and monasteries) and the return of the rural villa in the seventh and eighth centuries (the Umayyad qusur). We will explore the plague and the Late Antique Little Ice Age and their impacts on both urban and rural communities. The course will highlight the most iconic monuments of the early Islamic period (the Dome of the Rock and the Great Mosque in Damascus) and examine them within their Late Antique contexts, while also exploring artistic innovations and new ideas such as religiously motivated iconoclasm and aniconism. We will conclude with an overview of the Near East after the fall of the Umayyads, the rise of the Abbasids and the subsequent move of their power base east into modern Iraq.",

    "summary": "This course aims to enable students to read, examine and interpret Roman coins and Latin inscriptions, mostly of the 1st century BC to the 5th century AD. Participants will learn how inscribed objects can provide them with a fuller picture of the history and archaeology of the Roman Empire.",
    "course_description": "Roman coins and Latin inscriptions are amongst the most important sources for Roman imperial history and archaeology. No other imperial propaganda tool circulated as widely as coins, no other inscribed objects were produced in similar quantities and (apart from pottery) no other category of artefact is as important for dating Roman sites and archaeological contexts. Unlike mass-produced coins and other portable objects, inscriptions on stone tend to relate to local events (e.g. personal life stories of, or religious dedications by, members of the local community, building projects, etc.). For crucial aspects of Roman political, religious, economic and social history (such as the lives of people in the provinces) inscriptions are an important, if not the only, source.Despite their significance, coins and inscriptions, unless cited by a secondary author, are often ignored by a high proportion of archaeologists as well as some historians. This course aims to provide students with the skills to understand and interpret coin legends and images and the text of basic Latin inscriptions. Identifying individual coins will form as much part of the course as gaining the ability to correctly interpret larger assemblages, be they votive deposits from temples or sacred springs, or personal savings hidden in times of crisis. Placing coins and inscriptions in their proper archaeological and historical context is the ultimate goal.The ability to make the most of the two principal categories of inscribed objects from Roman Antiquity will provide students with a richer and more varied understanding of life in the Roman world.No prior knowledge of Latin is required. Neither, however, will it be possible to avoid dealing with basic Latin. Inscriptions and coin legends include a limited number of recurring and frequently abbreviated Latin terms. While a willingness to deal with and memorise such key terms is essential, deciphering inscriptions and coin legends is much easier than commonly thought.",

Whilst focusing on pagan religion more than Christianity, the early spread and reasons for the success of this religion, which was to shape the medieval and post-medieval history of the West, will also be explored.",
    "course_description": "The Roman Empire, stretching from Britain and the Atlantic coast of Gaul and the Iberian Peninsula in the west to eastern Anatolia, the Syrian Desert and Egypt in the east, was arguably the most cosmopolitan state the western world had ever seen. This is reflected in the astonishing diversity of divine powers venerated within the Empire, ranging from the classical pantheon and a myriad of native gods and goddesses to Oriental deities, from divine powers in human guise to sacred animals. Religious sites included public and private temples in major towns and cities as well as pilgrimage centres and healing sanctuaries in remote locations. Natural phenomena equally enjoyed religious veneration, notably sacred springs, rivers, lakes, trees and mountains. With few exceptions (such as Christianity, Druidism and Manichaeism) the individual had almost unlimited freedom of choice. It was also mainly within the Empire that Christianity grew from a persecuted minority cult to a world religion, a development which has shaped history to the present day. Religion in the Roman Empire can help us to understand the modern world, both because important developments originated then and because the cosmopolitan nature of Roman religion provides a useful analogy for our own time.",

This course provides a systematic framework so that students will gain the maximum benefit from participating in a field project. It builds on introductory concepts in archaeological fieldwork introduced in the first year of study, to develop students' practical skills in the practice of archaeology in the field, and applying theoretical concepts introduced in the classroom. Approved projects must provide students with experience in the fundamentals of archaeological fieldwork, including but not limited to, survey and excavation techniques, sampling strategies for environmental samples, artefact recovery and recording, and post-excavation cataloguing and recording of material. A short report on the project and tasks completed will develop key skills in communicating the results of fieldwork and presentation of archaeological data.This course is specifically intended for students following an Archaeology (single or joint) degree programme.

    "summary": "This course offers an introduction to Archaeology, focusing on case-studies from Eurasian later prehistory and beyond. It discusses themes such as the rise of early states, monumentality, urbanism, and death and burial. It offers insights into the workings of archaeological research and interpretation through addressing key theoretical perspectives and methods.",
    "course_description": "The course has several themes: Theme 1 (understanding early civilisations) introduces the course and gives you some useful background to the history of Archaeology and aspects of relevant theory and interpretation. It provides a background to understand the rise of early civilisations in Western Asia and Egypt, focusing on the birth of writing, state formation, and the rise of markets and trade. Theme 2 (scientific archaeology) highlights useful applications in archaeological research for studying artifacts and human skeletal remains. Theme 3 (monuments and megaliths) addresses how archaeological science has been able to make sense of Stonehenge, BritainÂ¿s most famous prehistoric monument; and other European megaliths. Theme 4 (European societies from the Bronze Age to the Medieval period) introduces a range of Later Prehistoric and post-Roman societies of Europe, addressing the specifics of their lifeways and the rise of urbanism. The course concludes with the archaeology of the Roman frontiers and Medieval Britain. Many of these topics, as well as several others, can be pursued in further depth in Archaeology 2A and 2B, and in Honours option classes (3-4th years).There are normally two 1-hour lectures per week and one tutorial per week starting in week 3. Tutorials provide a friendly small group learning context of about 10-12 students. They complement lectures, web pages and textbooks, while helping you develop the skills required for tackling the assessments upon which your final grade depends. Tutorials provide a context for discussion of lecture topics and critical evaluation of selected reading items. They also introduce key themes and issues, while allowing you to ask questions about any aspect of Archaeology that you wish to know more about or need help with. Active contribution and participation is required of all students.",

Different themes will be explored, such as the current understanding of the impact of the introduction of agriculture and more sedentary lifestyles, as well as work environment and general living condition to overall health in past societies. Similarly, the detrimental impact of social injustice, discrimination and racism on human well-being will be discussed.Using archaeological and bioarchaeological sources, interpreted in an interdisciplinary setting, students will explore how people have responded or adjusted to these factors. They will learn how studies of burials and archaeological skeletons can give us an insight into how social relations were constructed and formed in the past. Other than discussing these topics in an archaeological/historical settings, students will be given the opportunity to reflect on factors that determines health in contemporary society today.",

The background, nature and effects of this interaction are considered for a number of states between Egypt and the Aegean, as well as the reasons behind the eventual collapse of this system.",
    "course_description": "This course examines the motivation and practicalities behind the intensive interaction between state-level societies in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Late Bronze Age. Geographically, the focus will range from Egypt, the Levant, Anatolia to the mainland Aegean and Crete. The course considers the different manifestations of palace-centred urban societies in this area which developed along different trajectories and with various degrees of contact among each other. By the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1400-1200 BC), in all of these societies, access to exotic information, goods, iconography and sometimes even human beings and their skills played an important role in establishment and legitimation of social elites.The evidence considered stems primarily from the excavation of settlement sites and ship wrecks, monumental artwork, iconography, distribution of artefacts and textual sources such as diplomatic correspondence. Questions and debates about state formation, economical organisation, modes of interaction and trade, and different forms of governance, ideology and religion are of particular importance, as well as the influence of technological innovations and geographical factors.This course is meant to be of interest for students who wish to learn more about early Near Eastern and Mediterranean civilisations, the development and interaction of urban, state-level societies in the Old World, and their material and textual legacy. Weekly topics include: Politics and policy in the exploration of the Eastern Mediterranean; problems at the interface between textual information and the archaeological record, diplomacy and trade in the Ancient Near East, Egypt and the Amarna Letters, Minoan-style frescoes in the Eastern Mediterranean, the archaeology of the Levantine city-states, the palatial period on Minoan Crete, the Greek mainland, Western Anatolia between Mycenaean and Hittite interests, the Hittite Empire, and the collapse of the Late Bronze Age palace societies.The course consists of weekly two-hour class meetings with lectures, presentations and group discussions.",

Established patterns of urbanism declined and the early medieval period saw a radical realignment in the economic, social and political structures of Europe, the Mediterranean and western Asia. From the late sixth century the empire faced new challenges including invasions by the Slavs, Bulgars and other barbarians in the Balkans and Greece. We will begin by considering Justinian's empire and in particular by reviewing the recent debate on the end of urbanism in late antiquity as well as the contribution of environmental and climate studies as a key for understanding many of these transitions. We will consider the impact that the Arab invasions had on the Byzantine world by land and sea; in particular, on urbanism, religious art and architecture and on trade in the eastern Mediterranean provinces. The course requires students to engage with both written and material evidence, including the study of monumental architecture, maritime archaeology, pottery and coins.",

    "course_description": "The course examines the development of Etruscan society, one of the first urban civilizations in western Europe, from a formative stage in the Early Iron Age through the growth and expansion of city states (7th-5th centuries BC), urban life, and the subsequent transformation associated with the expansion of Rome in the 4th-3rd centuries BC. A range of evidence is considered, primarily from archaeological sites, with an emphasis on funerary as well as residential contexts, inscriptions and 'art' (notably tomb paintings).  Themes of particular interest include social organisation (using funerary data), state formation, urbanization, social identities, trade and interaction (both within the Mediterranean and with central Europe).The course is designed for those with a special interest in early civilizations, the ancient Mediterranean world, and ancient art, such as Archaeology and Classics students. Major topics for discussion on a weekly basis are: Early Iron Age settlements; Burials and funerary rituals, 950-700 BC; The rise of the city state (8th-7th centuries BC) and the Orientalizing phenomenon; Etruscan settlements in the 7th-6th centuries BC; Urbanisation; The Etruscans and their neighbours (Greeks, Phoenicians, Celts): trade, interaction and mobility;  Trade, harbours and sanctuaries; Towns and town planning in the 6th-5th centuries BC; Iconography and ideology: funerary traditions and tomb painting in the 6th-5th century BC; Etruria in the Hellenistic period (4th-2nd centuries BC).The course is especially concerned with:  how different types of evidence (archaeological, textual, architectural, art historical, etc.) can be used to illuminate aspects of the period; controversies and hypotheses surrounding the processes of change during this period, with specific reference to the increasing complexity of funerary evidence, changes in settlement patterns and in the character of residential sites; the applicability of general theoretical models and methodologies in elucidating such questions as the formation of a state; the way in which different research traditions and approaches, past and present, may impact on reconstruction; the place and significance of Etruscan civilization within the broader setting of the western European Iron Age and the transition from 'prehistory' to 'history'.",

To examine this process, you will be introduced to a broad variety of methods from interviewing to archive research and photography to fieldwork, in order to engage with contemporary issues including: the Anthropocene debate, 'fallism' and the preservation of contested monuments, and the role of heritage and archaeology in global conflict and peace-making.",

We will explore what the word heritage means in different contexts and discuss how these understandings and uses of heritage influence societies. We also explore how contemporary archaeology approaches can be a powerful tool for understanding how the past continually shapes the present-day and our futures. Students will learn about the emergence and practices of heritage in both 'official' contexts (including with UNESCO and the World Heritage Convention), and, at a more everyday level, how heritage can be understood as a process that is both tangible and intangible, and something that all people, everywhere, create, use and share.The first weeks of the course will introduce the key concepts and study of heritage -- critical heritage studies -- and contemporary archaeology. Subsequent weeks will then be mainly theme-led (part taught by guests) focussing on topics of contemporary concern, including heritage and the Anthropocene, the archaeology of conflict and disaster, and the role of heritage as a global socio-political force. Research methods will also be introduced through detailed case studies (including interviews, fieldwork, archival research and engagement with artistic/creative practice).",

    "course_description": "This course first considers the potential in theory and practice for such a thing as island archaeology and investigates some recurrent themes, starting with island colonisations across the Mediterranean. We then explore a series of case studies, focusing on island societies that have differed strikingly from their mainland counterparts. One example is Malta in the so-called temple period (circa 3500-2400 BC). Another is Sardinia in the Copper and Bronze Ages, an island with remarkable stone monuments (e.g. rock-cut tombs and Nuragic towers), along with advanced metal working and evidence for international contacts. Other case studies help to assess periods of conspicuous cultural development in the light of current theories and debates about, for example, insularity, connectivity and identity. The course also has a recurrent focus on 'ritual' and ritual monuments. Finally, we consider one of the most iconic of the world's islands -- Rapa Nui (Easter Island) in the Pacific -- and some controversies surrounding its significance for island archaeology.Key skills: How To: use and combine different types of evidence (archaeological, textual, science-based); deal with controversies and competing hypotheses; utilise relevant theoretical models and methodologies; evaluate past and present research traditions and approaches; critique effectively and fairly.Skills to develop/enhance: Initiative, e.g. capacity for independent study/research; expression and communication (written, oral and visual).",

    "course_description": "This course will provide a broad introduction to Marine Archaeology and illustrate through a series of case studies how crucial the sea was in terms of human development. The social, economic and cultural progress of humanity has always been closely connected to the water and the sea. From the spread of human groups in early prehistory to the importance of container shipping and maritime commerce to modern economies today, sea travel has remained central to the development and maintenance of human societies. It seems odd then that it enjoys, at best, a supporting role in dominant historical narratives. In such narratives, it is common to read about the industrial and agricultural revolutions with little or no mention of the vital seafaring revolution that took place long before them. In this modern age of air travel, it is perhaps all too easy to underestimate the role of the sea. It is somewhat ironic that as global sea levels continue to rise, an awareness of the sea as a driver of human change and development has fallen at a similarly dramatic rate.Case studies discussed in the course range widely in terms of geography and chronology with examples from Scandinavia to Australia which range in date from 10,000 years ago to the last century. An example of some of the issues we may tackle are:Methods and techniques of underwater survey and excavationPost-excavation processing of underwater materialThe problems of conservation and wet finds processingShipwrecks from 1200 BCSunken harbours, sunken cities and processes of submergenceLake dwellings and freshwater archaeologyUnderwater archaeology vs. treasure huntingMarine Cultural Heritage and Sustainable DevelopmentPolicies and legal frameworks protecting Marine Cultural Heritage",

It begins in the late-Roman/Iron Age period, covers the impact of Christianisation and the Vikings, and the impact of the Norman Conquest. We will explore core themes of religion, trade, mobility, food, and cross-cultural contact. A key aim of this course is to highlight the diversity in the archaeology of the region but also the high degree of interaction around the \"inner sea\" and how the different sub-regions reacted to similar external forces and events.Students will develop a strong grounding in the period and will analyse and discuss a range of archaeological evidence including (but not limited to) funerary archaeology, settlements, and bioarchaeology (including isotopic data and aDNA). In addition to lectures and seminars, students will have the opportunity to get up close with early medieval material culture and sites through a museum visit and an optional fieldtrip.",

This course will provide an overview on migratory processes from prehistory to the present, focusing on archaeological sources but also incorporating written evidence whenever available.",
    "course_description": "Migrations represent one of the most defining features of human history since its beginnings to the present. In recent years, archaeological research has witnessed the so-called 'third science revolution', triggered by the development of bioarchaeological methods - especially archaeogenetics and isotopic analyses. These approaches have forced us to radically rethink mobility in the past and develop new pathways of integrating all available evidence to move beyond simple narratives of human migration. Due to its long-term perspective, archaeology is in an advantageous position to contribute to a deeper reflection on the topic, by not only counteracting isolationist narratives, but also showing the complexity of human mobility in the past and present and the challenges and opportunities it poses.This course will provide an overview on migratory processes from early prehistory ('out of Africa' in the Palaeolithic) to the 21st century. It will combine an introduction to the key definitions and theoretical perspectives on migration with the presentation of specific case studies from different periods and geographical regions. While the main emphasis will be on the material evidence of migrations, other sources including texts will also be incorporated whenever available. Thus, the course has an interdisciplinary design, and should be attractive for students from different subject areas.",

It will include up to date and ongoing research into key issues relevant to study of this period, as well as providing a good grounding in aspects of daily life for commoners as well as the elite and royalty. Textual sources in translation will be consulted to provide insights into the economy and administration of the New Kingdom, given the rich corpus for this period, and aspects of legitimisation will be approached through the study of archaism in statuary and representational art both in the context of Egyptian and foreign rule within Egypt.",
    "course_description": "This course covers a period of time during which foreign relations are crucial. The Second Intermediate Period encompasses the period of increased Asiatic ruler in the Delta, with the New Kingdom often characterised as the great period of Egyptian empire. Foreign relations and ultimately foreign rule within Egypt are also key elements throughout the Late Period.The course aims at introducing the student to the sources necessary for the study of this period, a period with great documentary evidence (notably in the New Kingdom) for daily life, administration and economy, all of which will feature in translation. Although chronologically bounded, and largely chronologically ordered, the course aims to look at broader themes, including the protection of Egypt's borders, kingship, ethnicity, and religion, and how these change over the time periods being discovered. The course also aims to give students an up to date working knowledge of Egyptian archaeology, in terms of sites being worked at today, and in recent years, as well as more established sources of our knowledge.",

This course will explore childhood as a social construct, and the archaeological evidence for differing experiences of children over time and space. It will incorporate multidisciplinary perspectives from history, classics, and anthropology on themes such as identity, agency, gender, mobility, health and diet, structural violence and political/social reform.",
    "course_description": "The study of children and childhood has long been of interest in the fields of archaeology, history, and classics, highlighting the importance of this particular age group in understanding past societies. It is a matter of fact that children have always been present throughout pre-history to the modern-day, but their voices and lived experiences have not always been directly accessible, often presented through an archaeological record generated, and interpreted, by adults. The concept of 'childhood' too is a social construct, subject to the needs of a population within a particular geographic or temporal context, and economic, political, cultural and environmental influence.Within this course, students will take a critical approach to how we can identify evidence of children and childhood in the past through a combination of theoretical and scientific approaches, including osteoarchaeology, analysis of settlements, material culture, and funerary practices. It will also incorporate historical, classical, and anthropological perspectives to explore the shifting perception of childhood over time and space, and evidence of identity and agency of children in past societies, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary research. It will cover a range of themes including: childcare practices, health and disease, death and burial, voluntary and forced migration, domestic and occupational roles, marginalised childhoods, and transitions between life stages. Recognising the unique role that the study of childhood in the past can play in the education of children in the present day, students will also consider the value of research-led public outreach initiatives throughout the course. They will also gain hands-on experience in analysis of archaeological human skeletal remains during a lab-based practical session.",

    "course_description": "The course provides an in-depth survey of Hittite civilisation, one of the most powerful Near Eastern empires of the Late Bronze Age. The course examines the emergence of urban civilisation in the highlands of central Anatolia (modern Turkey), the development and introduction of writing systems in this area, the role of technological innovation and ideological changes through the successive stages of development of Hittite civilisation until its rise to prominence in the \"Empire Period\" (ca 1400-1200 BC) and final collapse around 1200 BC. The evidence considered is primarily from the excavation of settlement sites, monumental artwork, iconography and textual sources. Questions and debates about state formation and collapse are of particular importance, as well as Hittite adaptation to an economically challenging and difficult-to-control environment, the background of the gradual importation of Mesopotamian concepts about society and religion, and Hittite general interaction with powerful neighbours in Mesopotamia, Syria, the Levant and Egypt.This course is meant to be of interest for students who wish to learn more about early Near Eastern and Mediterranean civilisations, the development and interaction of urban, state-level societies in the Old World, and their material and textual legacy. Weekly topics include: The (re-)discovery of Hittite civilisation, Assyrian trade colonies and local communities in early second millennium Anatolia, the rise of the Hittite State, languages and writing systems, Hittite society and settlement, Hittite economy, the military, Hittite religion between traditional piety and imperial ideology, Hittite monuments, northern and western neighbours of the Empire (the Kaska tribes, Arzawa, Wilusa) and the collapse of the Hittite Empire.The course consists of weekly two-hour class meetings with lectures, presentations and group discussions.

    "summary": "The course investigates the archaeological landscape of the Scottish Lowlands, by assessing the potential and limitations of its archaeological record, and by tracing how people of the past explored and exploited this landscape over time, from the earliest settlers to AD 1000. Course material benefits from having most data sources (aerial photographs, finds archives, grey literature reports) as well as the professionals generating these (RCAHMS, National Museums Scotland, commercial units) in close proximity of the University. As most data now derive from developer-funded archaeology, the course also offers insight into commercial archaeology practice in Scotland.",
    "course_description": "The course introduces the concept of 'archaeological landscapes' using the University's immediate hinterland as a case study. The core area comprises the lowland landscapes between the Moray Firth and the Scottish Borders and the particular character of their archaeological record. The chronological scope extends from the initial colonization of Scotland, but more specifically from the Neolithic period to c. AD 1000, with the main focus on later pre- and proto-history: c.1500 BC - AD 500. Building on content from Archaeology 2A, the course concentrates on key concepts such as survival and detection of the archaeological resource and the impact of developer-funded archaeology in preserving archaeological remains through record. The course content will include active projects and guest lectures delivered by professional archaeologists from various sectors. The course presents a diachronic, comparative approach to critically examine one type of an archaeological landscape. Course work will capitalise on locally-accessible resources such as the National Monuments Record (delivered via CANMORE and CANMAP/PASTMAP) and the National Museums Scotland. It will allow students to explore developer-funded archaeology, a major branch of employment for graduates. Compared to other taught undergraduate courses in archaeology the specific course content and student course work can greatly benefit from the geographical proximity of the study area and the generators of primary data and their interpretation (e.g. RCAHMS and most commercial units). The course may also provide students with a platform from which to develop dissertation topics in the local environment and to enhance their expertise in Scottish prehistory.",

    "summary": "Constantinople, easily the largest and most splendid city of medieval Christendom down to the early thirteenth century, was adorned by the majestic dome of its famous cathedral church of Hagia Sophia - a landmark for all to behold -, its unique collection of ancient statuary, and the world's choicest collection of relics. The course traces the four life cycles of this medieval megalopolis, from Constantine and Justinian's late antique city via its middle (c.750-1204) and late Byzantine (1261-1453) incarnations to the Ottoman conquest in 1453 plus subsequent transformation into an Islamic capital. Participants will become familiar with both textual and material sources on Constantinople's history; all written sources will be provided in English translation.",
    "course_description": "Ancient Byzantium - renamed Constantinople by its founder, Emperor Constantine I, called Konstantiniye by its Ottoman conquerors and nowadays known as Istanbul (from Greek eis ten polin, 'into the city') - proved one of history's more important stages. Variously hailed as the 'New Rome', 'New Jerusalem', or 'Queen of Cities' and strategically situated on the Bosphorus, it became the 'bridge' from Asia to Europe; at the same time it guarded the passage from the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara and on to the Mediterranean (and vice-versa). More than once the Byzantine empire's survival depended on the city's strong walls, erected by Emperor Theodosios in the early fifth century. Ultimately conquered twice, in 1204 when the city was looted by the Venetians and knights of the Fourth Crusade and in 1453 by Mehmed II 'the Conqueror', Constantine's city remained a major urban centre to the present day.The course introduces participants to various aspects of life in the Byzantine capital and, in doing so, to a variety of approaches to (medieval) urban history. We shall examine the city's topography, demography, and imperial programmes of creating a residence and capital of unrivalled splendour: both in terms of ideology (seven hills for the New Rome, legends of apostolic foundation) and of physical, material embellishment. The course traces the origins and growth of the city's collection of relics (of at least 476 saints) and of urban liturgies and processions; Constantinople's political role as the centre of a - in medieval terms - highly centralised polity, the Eastern Roman/Byzantine empire; and its cultural life as a centre of manuscript production and learning. It looks at practical issues such as provisioning a medieval megalopolis ('mega-city') with water, grain, vegetables, and meat. We shall explore hygiene (bathing) and health-care in the wake of sporadic outbreaks of the bubonic plague, from the sixth through the eighth centuries, as well as the damages done by severe earthquakes and harsh winters. The final session explores political, cultural, and ideological continuities and changes from the Byzantines to the city's new Ottoman lords.Methodologically, we shall address the challenge of reconstructing medieval Constantinople from highly rhetoricised source texts on the one hand and rather few accessible archaeological remains on the other. Medieval texts describing the city and its monuments were written by Byzantine literati in an elaborate register of classicising Greek and follow their own rhetorical rules, and often refuse to offer us straightforward information; and given the city's continuous settlement history that precludes large-scale excavations, archaeological data are comparatively sparse.Over the course of term, we shall discuss the following topics:1.\tThe Birth of a Capital: From Constantine to Justinian2.\tCircles of Decline and Renewal (626, 766, 1204, 1261, 1453), or: A Short History of Constantinople3.\tMethodological Challenges: Material and Textual Sources on Constantinople4.\tThe New Rome: Politics & Palaces5.\tThe New Jerusalem: Heavenly Protection for the Queen of Cities6.\tDiseases and Disasters: Plagues, Earthquakes & Heavy Winters7.\tProvisioning a Capital: Water, Grain & Vegetables, Livestock, Trade8.\tSchools & Theatra: Constantinople as a Hub of Learning9.\tCeremonial, Public Spectacles, and Processions10.\tSacred Topography and Spiritual Life in the Later Centuries11.\tThe Early Ottoman City: Imperial Transitions from Mehmet the Conqueror to SÃ¼leyman the Magnificent",

    "summary": "This course aims to familiarise students with the armies and military infrastructure of the Roman and Persian Empires from the 1st century BC to the 7th century AD. Recent discoveries of a remarkably sophisticated military apparatus on an astonishing scale in the late antique Persian World, in comparison with the much widely known military monuments of Rome, will provide participants with a better understanding of ancient geopolitics and the use of hard power in antiquity.",
    "course_description": "This course will explore the military forces and infrastructure of some of the ancient world's largest, most powerful and long-lived empires, those of Rome and Persia. It will cover the period from the 1st century BC to the 7th century AD.The Roman Empire was the dominant power in the Mediterranean and controlled up to the 5th century the majority of Europe's population, as well as Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt and Northern Africa. Split from the late 4th century into Western and Eastern Roman successor states, its surviving eastern half remained a dominant player on the world stage up to the first half of the 7th century.As far as Persia is concerned, the course will focus on Late Antiquity, as there is much more concrete evidence for Sasanian than for Parthian military installations. Centred on modern Iran, the Sasanian Empire (3rd-7th centuries) stretched to Mesopotamia in the west, to the western parts of the Indian Subcontinent in the east and into the Arabian Peninsula and Central Asia in the south and north. Until a few years ago, little had been known about its military infrastructure. Recent research has revealed frontier walls and defended compounds of greater dimensions than those found in the late Roman world. It now appears that the Sasanian Empire had an army, which in terms of the scale and sophistication of its military architecture, its capabilities, achievements and, probably, its numerical strength, matched or more than matched those of the most powerful states in antiquity.The course will present the evidence for the organisation of the Roman and Sasanian armies, the monuments they have left behind, and for their deployment in war. It will explore the question how they were able to expand or maintain such vast territorial empires over centuries. In contrast to the Eurocentric perspective of most courses on ancient warfare, this course will seek to demonstrate how the bipolar world of Late Antiquity was shaped by competing superpowers.",

The course will explore the sixth-century building boom in the countryside (villages and monasteries) and the return of the rural villa in the seventh and eighth centuries (the Umayyad qusur). We will explore the plague and the Late Antique Little Ice Age and their impacts on both urban and rural communities. The course will highlight the most iconic monuments of the early Islamic period (the Dome of the Rock and the Great Mosque in Damascus) and examine them within their Late Antique contexts, while also exploring artistic innovations and new ideas such as religiously motivated iconoclasm and aniconism. We will conclude with an overview of the Near East after the fall of the Umayyads, the rise of the Abbasids and the subsequent move of their power base east into modern Iraq.",

Here, archaeology has played a pivotal role in the western colonial projects; in the formation of modern nation states; and in the public image of the Taliban and Islamic State groups. Taking a step back from the primary source material, we will examine how historical trajectories are constructed and how these constructions have been used to reinforce political identities.",
    "course_description": "This thematic course examines how archaeology and material culture have been used in the political agendas of the modern Middle East: from the western colonising projects of the 18th and 19th century to the destruction of archaeological sites and artefacts undertaken by the Taliban and Islamic State. It explores how some historical trajectories have been promoted through, for example, the selection, excavation, and interpretation of certain archaeological sites, while other, competing histories have been side-lined. Archaeology and material culture take centre stage through weekly case studies in which we will examine, for example, how the search for a Biblical and Roman past by early western archaeologists has been detrimental for our understanding of later periods, and how the rush for the treasures of Pharaonic Egypt shaped our knowledge at the expense of the rich Coptic and early Muslim material culture. We will explore the role of monuments, such as the Dome of the Rock and the remains of Herod's temple in Jerusalem, in the mid-20th century nation-building project, and how archaeological sites with Roman pasts were promoted to western institutions to form diplomatic bonds. The course concludes by assessing the role of archaeology in current political trajectories, looking, for example, at the competing interests in rebuilding war-torn Syria and the revival of the Pharaoh in the building of the new Egyptian Museum.",

    "course_description": "This course aims to introduce students to the material culture of the Roman Near East and Egypt and to develop their understanding of the interaction between eastern and western cultural forces in classical antiquity. More specifically, through detailed studies of the painting, sculpture, mosaics, coinage and architecture of key cities, such as Alexandria, Jerusalem and Petra, it will be demonstrated how varied was the reception of classical culture by the pre-existing local societies and their religions. Despite the adoption of aspects of Greek and Roman art, local cultural identities remain distinctive in their unique blending of local and classical elements. The sophistication evident in the use of these classical elements to create new versions of art will be highlighted, as well as the interaction between art, politics and religion. Particular focus will be placed upon the transition to Roman rule and the underlying Hellenistic continuity. Also, the rise of Christianity and its influence on Jewish art will be examined to understand how religious identities were expressed through art. This artistic expression, with enduring Greco-Roman influences, survives into the early Islamic period (c. 700 AD) in the design of famed monuments, such as the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. The comprehension of the cultural interaction of this region is particularly relevant to increasing understanding between the West and the Middle East today.",

    "course_description": "Statues and reliefs in marble and bronze were a pervasive presence in the landscape of ancient Greek cities. They stood in private and public spaces alike and are among the most enduring legacies of ancient Greece. Free-standing statues dotted civic centres; architectural sculpture decorated major monuments; and sculpted stone slabs were erected on top of burials, therefore shaping interactions with the gods, the living, and the dead.The aim of this course is to explore the styles, iconography, materials, and functions of Greek sculpture in their original contexts covering topics such as the development of bronze as a large-scale medium, the revolution in seeing and representing known as the 'classical style', Greek funerary sculpture and portraiture, the 'statuescape' of the main Greek sanctuaries and the uses of Greek sculptural motives by non-Greek Eastern dynasts in the fourth century BC.Questions to explore include: What purpose did sculpture serve in ancient cities? How were these works, small and large, bronze and marble, produced? How were they seen and understood in their original contexts? How does their form, material and iconography reflect their function? Which themes got represented in sculptural form? What can we learn about the classical world from the study of Greek sculpture?",

More especially it will engage with the new approaches concerned with Identity and Multi-culturalism, and opportunities for research arising from programmes such as the Portable Antiquities Scheme. At the same time the rich epigraphic corpus of Roman Inscriptions in Britain (RIB) is now available on-line and the new Oxford Handbook to Roman Britain provides accessible new interpretations for discussion.There will be an optional visit to view parts of the Wall and its museums.",

How can pottery be handled as a source for interpretation of the past? How do we integrate shape and type identification, archaeometric techniques and contextual information into narrative histories of the Greek past? The course aims to develop both theoretical and hands-on skills of pottery analysis.",

More detailed information on the manufacturing process, the origin and composition of raw materials, craftsmanship and technological skills or the standardization of ancient ceramics can be obtained today with the aid of a variety of theoretical and methodological approaches. This course will familiarise students with the corpus of Greek pottery from different regions (e.g. Corinth, Athens, Magna Graecia and Asia Minor) produced between the 7th to 4th centuries BCE as case-studies to develop a fuller understanding of the potential of pottery to inform us about the ancient world. Students will gain an insight into \"handling\" Greek pottery from current theoretical, methodological, and hands-on perspectives, including via practical classes and relevant field-trips.",

    "summary": "This course aims to enable students to read, examine and interpret Roman coins and Latin inscriptions, mostly of the 1st century BC to the 5th century AD. Participants will learn how inscribed objects can provide them with a fuller picture of the history and archaeology of the Roman Empire.",
    "course_description": "Roman coins and Latin inscriptions are amongst the most important sources for Roman imperial history and archaeology. No other imperial propaganda tool circulated as widely as coins, no other inscribed objects were produced in similar quantities and (apart from pottery) no other category of artefact is as important for dating Roman sites and archaeological contexts. Unlike mass-produced coins and other portable objects, inscriptions on stone tend to relate to local events (e.g. personal life stories of, or religious dedications by, members of the local community, building projects, etc.). For crucial aspects of Roman political, religious, economic and social history (such as the lives of people in the provinces) inscriptions are an important, if not the only, source.Despite their significance, coins and inscriptions, unless cited by a secondary author, are often ignored by a high proportion of archaeologists as well as some historians. This course aims to provide students with the skills to understand and interpret coin legends and images and the text of basic Latin inscriptions. Identifying individual coins will form as much part of the course as gaining the ability to correctly interpret larger assemblages, be they votive deposits from temples or sacred springs, or personal savings hidden in times of crisis. Placing coins and inscriptions in their proper archaeological and historical context is the ultimate goal.The ability to make the most of the two principal categories of inscribed objects from Roman Antiquity will provide students with a richer and more varied understanding of life in the Roman world.No prior knowledge of Latin is required. Neither, however, will it be possible to avoid dealing with basic Latin. Inscriptions and coin legends include a limited number of recurring and frequently abbreviated Latin terms. While a willingness to deal with and memorise such key terms is essential, deciphering inscriptions and coin legends is much easier than commonly thought.",

Whilst focusing on pagan religion more than Christianity, the early spread and reasons for the success of this religion, which was to shape the medieval and post-medieval history of the West, will also be explored.",
    "course_description": "The Roman Empire, stretching from Britain and the Atlantic coast of Gaul and the Iberian Peninsula in the west to eastern Anatolia, the Syrian Desert and Egypt in the east, was arguably the most cosmopolitan state the western world had ever seen. This is reflected in the astonishing diversity of divine powers venerated within the Empire, ranging from the classical pantheon and a myriad of native gods and goddesses to Oriental deities, from divine powers in human guise to sacred animals. Religious sites included public and private temples in major towns and cities as well as pilgrimage centres and healing sanctuaries in remote locations. Natural phenomena equally enjoyed religious veneration, notably sacred springs, rivers, lakes, trees and mountains. With few exceptions (such as Christianity, Druidism and Manichaeism) the individual had almost unlimited freedom of choice. It was also mainly within the Empire that Christianity grew from a persecuted minority cult to a world religion, a development which has shaped history to the present day. Religion in the Roman Empire can help us to understand the modern world, both because important developments originated then and because the cosmopolitan nature of Roman religion provides a useful analogy for our own time.",

We will also explore how Nabataean culture impacted the later Islamic world and the relationship between the archaeological site of Petra and its modern Bedouin inhabitants. Students will be able to synthesise and analyse the ancient evidence, and modern scholarship, and will work independently to develop research skills.

Greece), this area was a thriving and expanding economic powerhouse during the archaic period with a considerable archaeological and historical imprint. Ionia and in particular the city of Miletus is considered the birthplace of natural philosophy, with its intellectuals and craftsmen recognised beyond the borders of their homeland. The Greek cities maintained far-reaching contacts that encompassed the entire Mediterranean World while, at the same time, paying tribute to the Lydian and later Persian empire.

The long imperial Roman peace has left the densest and most varied architectural record of any period of antiquity, and at the height of the empire more cities, communities, and individuals than ever before came to invest in monumental built structures. This course studies the materials, technology, and functions of these buildings as well as their appearance and effect, from the middle Republic through to the Late Roman period, in all areas of the Roman empire. Students will learn about major monuments in Rome and Italy and other leading centres of the empire (such as Athens, Ephesus, Palmyra, and Lepcis Magna) and about the main strands and contexts of construction in the eastern and western provinces.

In the first and second centuries AD in particular more stone and bronze images were produced than in any comparable period before or since. This course examines the ways in which this sculpture was used, the contexts in which it was displayed, and the methods used to produce it. Detailed case studies of individual monuments, sites, and sculptural assemblages, from across the Roman empire, will further familiarize students with the ways in sculpture was viewed and understood in specific local contexts. Students learn about major monuments in Rome and Italy and other leading centres of the empire (such as Aphrodisias, Athens, Ephesus, and Lepcis Magna) and about the varying strands and contexts of representation in the eastern and western provinces. The materials used for sculpture, the distribution of them, the identify of sculptors, and how we might unravel the manufacturing process will also be examined.",

    "summary": "The module explores the art and archaeology of Sparta and Laconia from the Geometric through the Classical period. Through the study of archaeological, art-historical, and textual sources, we will think of the image and reality of Spartan austerity, the relationship of Sparta and its perioikic neighbours in Laconia and Messenia, issues of art and craft production, social divisions, and Laconia's connections with the wider Mediterranean. The material will be placed in a political, social, and religious context.",
    "course_description": "Sparta's image as an austere society devoid of architectural embellishments and artistic production is known from the famous passage of the Classical-period author, Thucydides (1.10.2). However, the archaeological evidence from the eighth, seventh, sixth, and early fifth centuries BCE show that Sparta in the preceding centuries, had a rich local tradition in the arts and crafts, such as vase-painting, bronze work, bone and ivory carving, and sculpture. Its temples were embellished with elaborate architectural and decorative programs that show that Sparta, although had knowledge of current trends in the Greek world, it also followed a distinct local artistic and architectural tradition. Thus, Classical Sparta's image as we read in later sources, where it features as a Greek polis, which saw the militarisation of its male citizens and with no interest in art, does not translate into the previous centuries.This course will study the art and archaeology of Sparta and the region of Laconia from the Geometric through the Classical periods. It will be an interdisciplinary course where archaeological, textual, and art-historical sources will be used to consider several themes, such as the myth of the Spartan austerity, the relationship of Sparta and its perioikic neighbors in Laconia and Messenia, Spartan and Laconian sanctuaries and cults, burial customs, issues of art and craft production, social divisions (homoioi, perioikoi, helots, and women) and Laconia's connections with the wider Mediterranean especially, but not exclusively, through trade. We will pay special attention to the well-known Laconian black-figure vase painting, which, with its distinct shapes and iconography, was exported in the Greek world and beyond, and we will study the art and craft of bronze vessels and the impact of Laconian art abroad.",

    "course_description": "The Lydian Empire stretched from the Mediterranean coast to the Halys river in the Anatolian interior. Our understanding of the empire has long been filtered by the Greek perspective and, in particular, Herodotus' Lydian Logos (Hdt. 1:6-94), written by the historian about 120 years after the fall of the empire. There he describes in remarkable detail the close entanglement of the Lydian elites with the Greek world. He reports on, for example, the Lydian kings visiting the oracle of Apollo in Delphi or a conversation that supposedly took place between Lydian king Kroisos and the Athenian statesman Solon. The one-sided perspective sometimes obscures as well as reveals: while Lydians were admired for their proverbial wealth and luxurious textiles, Greek authors looked down on the effete lifestyle of their elite and consequently to members of the Greek elite that emulated this idle leisure. This form of moralizing tells us more about the Greeks than the Lydians, and detracts from their unique contributions, including the fact that the Lydian state was the first to use coinage and famously extracted their gold from the river Pactolus that flows through their capital at Sardis. Over the last 50 years, archaeological research in Lydia has begun to transform our understanding of the empire. This course will familiarise students with the material culture (e.g. architecture, pottery, metalwork, coinage) and social and religious customs of Lydia during the archaic period and investigate the interactions with their Greek neighbours (most of all Karians and Ionians) through the analysis of reciprocal influence visible in the material culture.",

    "course_description": "Rome was the dominant power in Europe and the Mediterranean, militarily, economically and culturally as well as in terms of the population it controlled for as much as 750 to 800 years (from the 2nd century BC to the 7th century AD), much longer than any state before or after. Indeed, for most periods of history no single state reached similar dominance in the West and, if so, it was normally for years or decades rather than centuries. The course will explore the reasons behind this unparalleled longevity in terms of the Empire's ability to inflict military defeats on its enemies as well as to integrate the conquered population. It will also explore the comparative state of development of the Empire and neighbouring cultures and political entities in various fields and how they interacted and influenced each other through trade, war and other contacts. While dominant in the Mediterranean and Europe, in the East a militarily and technologically equally highly developed power emerged. The course will go beyond traditional text-based approaches and use the full range of evidence at our disposal, including the remnants of the Roman Empire's material culture within and beyond its boundaries, as well that of its neighbours.",

The course will focus on Persian history of the period 559-330 BCE, a time when Iran ruled the biggest and empire the world had ever seen, occupying an area that stretched from Ethiopia to Afghanistan. The course will concentrate on the reigns of the Achaemenid monarchs (including Cyrus the Great, Darius the Great and Xerxes), examining their political, socio-cultural and military achievements and on life at court. Students will be required to evaluate Iranian, Near Eastern, Egyptian and Greek sources as evidence for the period. Other themes will include the language of the Persians, life in the provinces, women in Persian society, art and architecture, religion, and the use made of the Achaemenid period in more recent Iranian history. The course will of necessity engage with textual and visual materials. Students will be asked to engage with theoretical approaches to Near Eastern history such as Orientalism.",

    "course_description": "The course examines the development of Etruscan society, one of the first urban civilizations in western Europe, from a formative stage in the Early Iron Age through the growth and expansion of city states (7th-5th centuries BC), urban life, and the subsequent transformation associated with the expansion of Rome in the 4th-3rd centuries BC. A range of evidence is considered, primarily from archaeological sites, with an emphasis on funerary as well as residential contexts, inscriptions and 'art' (notably tomb paintings).  Themes of particular interest include social organisation (using funerary data), state formation, urbanization, social identities, trade and interaction (both within the Mediterranean and with central Europe).The course is designed for those with a special interest in early civilizations, the ancient Mediterranean world, and ancient art, such as Archaeology and Classics students. Major topics for discussion on a weekly basis are: Early Iron Age settlements; Burials and funerary rituals, 950-700 BC; The rise of the city state (8th-7th centuries BC) and the Orientalizing phenomenon; Etruscan settlements in the 7th-6th centuries BC; Urbanisation; The Etruscans and their neighbours (Greeks, Phoenicians, Celts): trade, interaction and mobility;  Trade, harbours and sanctuaries; Towns and town planning in the 6th-5th centuries BC; Iconography and ideology: funerary traditions and tomb painting in the 6th-5th century BC; Etruria in the Hellenistic period (4th-2nd centuries BC).The course is especially concerned with:  how different types of evidence (archaeological, textual, architectural, art historical, etc.) can be used to illuminate aspects of the period; controversies and hypotheses surrounding the processes of change during this period, with specific reference to the increasing complexity of funerary evidence, changes in settlement patterns and in the character of residential sites; the applicability of general theoretical models and methodologies in elucidating such questions as the formation of a state; the way in which different research traditions and approaches, past and present, may impact on reconstruction; the place and significance of Etruscan civilization within the broader setting of the western European Iron Age and the transition from 'prehistory' to 'history'.",

    "summary": "Underlying the most notable cultural achievements of the ancient Greeks was a dynamic economy that connected Greek communities to the wider Mediterranean world and provided the wealth and leisure on which developments in literature, philosophy, science, and art were built. This course will introduce students to the main features of this economy and its structure, studying various forms of production, exchange, and service, within the framework of the city-state.",
    "course_description": "This course will focus on the economy of the Greek city-states during the classical period (5th and 4th c BC). Starting from the economic organisation of the household and the cultivation of the countryside, it will expand its focus to non-agricultural occupations in the urban sphere and then to the networks of trade that connected the city-states, allowing the movement of a vast range of commodities. The focus on the democratic city-state and its institutions will allow students to grasp how economic activities were both enabled and constrained in order that the economy might flourish, yet without its benefits being distributed in a way contrary to the political ideals of the city-state. Political institutions in democratic cities targeted the predatory, rent-seeking activities of the elite that had been characteristic of the archaic era, and tried to retool the relationship between the people and its leaders by creating a symbiotic relationship where support of the citizenry and its recognition of the legitimacy of elite domination of major magistracies (e.g. the generalship) was paid for by onerous taxation.Whereas political institutions in democratic cities such as Athens constrained the mushrooming of economic inequality within the citizen body, the same was not true outwith the citizen body: by studying the institution of slavery, students will see how classical Greek society was parasitic upon a large population of imported foreign slaves, who performed the least pleasant tasks in the economy. The course will also go beyond democratic city-states such as Athens, looking at case studies (Sparta, Crete, Rhodes and so forth) that developed in different directions, underscoring the diversity of economic formations in the world of the city-states.",

Given the nature of the evidence, students will also learn to employ economic models to answer the questions they wish to pursue. In short, the course will enable students to make use of material that is highly diversified, ranging from archaeological remains on the one hand to inscriptions and literary sources on the other. The students will need to learn to include the full range of possible evidence into their historical arguments to achieve highly persuasive results. Given the importance of the topic - the ancient economy - the students will furthermore gain wide-reaching insights into ancient societies beyond the mere sphere of economy proper. The course is taught 'bottom up', i.e. students will first deal with the everyday realities of (household) economies - hence the course title, 'Life and Labour' - before engaging in interpretation of the ancient economy.Topics covered in class will include: the life-cycle, production, consumption, trade, farming, industries, city and country, poverty, wealth, slavery and free labour, etc.",

    "course_description": "The course provides an in-depth survey of Hittite civilisation, one of the most powerful Near Eastern empires of the Late Bronze Age. The course examines the emergence of urban civilisation in the highlands of central Anatolia (modern Turkey), the development and introduction of writing systems in this area, the role of technological innovation and ideological changes through the successive stages of development of Hittite civilisation until its rise to prominence in the \"Empire Period\" (ca 1400-1200 BC) and final collapse around 1200 BC. The evidence considered is primarily from the excavation of settlement sites, monumental artwork, iconography and textual sources. Questions and debates about state formation and collapse are of particular importance, as well as Hittite adaptation to an economically challenging and difficult-to-control environment, the background of the gradual importation of Mesopotamian concepts about society and religion, and Hittite general interaction with powerful neighbours in Mesopotamia, Syria, the Levant and Egypt.This course is meant to be of interest for students who wish to learn more about early Near Eastern and Mediterranean civilisations, the development and interaction of urban, state-level societies in the Old World, and their material and textual legacy. Weekly topics include: The (re-)discovery of Hittite civilisation, Assyrian trade colonies and local communities in early second millennium Anatolia, the rise of the Hittite State, languages and writing systems, Hittite society and settlement, Hittite economy, the military, Hittite religion between traditional piety and imperial ideology, Hittite monuments, northern and western neighbours of the Empire (the Kaska tribes, Arzawa, Wilusa) and the collapse of the Hittite Empire.The course consists of weekly two-hour class meetings with lectures, presentations and group discussions.

The course traces the four life cycles of this medieval megalopolis, from Constantine and Justinian's late antique city via its middle (c.750-1204) and late Byzantine (1261-1453) incarnations to the Ottoman conquest in 1453 plus subsequent transformation into an Islamic capital. Participants will become familiar with both textual and material sources on Constantinople's history; all written sources will be provided in English translation.",
    "course_description": "Ancient Byzantium - renamed Constantinople by its founder, Emperor Constantine I, called Konstantiniye by its Ottoman conquerors and nowadays known as Istanbul (from Greek eis ten polin, 'into the city') - proved one of history's more important stages. Variously hailed as the 'New Rome', 'New Jerusalem', or 'Queen of Cities' and strategically situated on the Bosphorus, it became the 'bridge' from Asia to Europe; at the same time it guarded the passage from the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara and on to the Mediterranean (and vice-versa). More than once the Byzantine empire's survival depended on the city's strong walls, erected by Emperor Theodosios in the early fifth century. Ultimately conquered twice, in 1204 when the city was looted by the Venetians and knights of the Fourth Crusade and in 1453 by Mehmed II 'the Conqueror', Constantine's city remained a major urban centre to the present day.The course introduces participants to various aspects of life in the Byzantine capital and, in doing so, to a variety of approaches to (medieval) urban history. We shall examine the city's topography, demography, and imperial programmes of creating a residence and capital of unrivalled splendour: both in terms of ideology (seven hills for the New Rome, legends of apostolic foundation) and of physical, material embellishment. The course traces the origins and growth of the city's collection of relics (of at least 476 saints) and of urban liturgies and processions; Constantinople's political role as the centre of a - in medieval terms - highly centralised polity, the Eastern Roman/Byzantine empire; and its cultural life as a centre of manuscript production and learning. It looks at practical issues such as provisioning a medieval megalopolis ('mega-city') with water, grain, vegetables, and meat. We shall explore hygiene (bathing) and health-care in the wake of sporadic outbreaks of the bubonic plague, from the sixth through the eighth centuries, as well as the damages done by severe earthquakes and harsh winters. The final session explores political, cultural, and ideological continuities and changes from the Byzantines to the city's new Ottoman lords.Methodologically, we shall address the challenge of reconstructing medieval Constantinople from highly rhetoricised source texts on the one hand and rather few accessible archaeological remains on the other. Medieval texts describing the city and its monuments were written by Byzantine literati in an elaborate register of classicising Greek and follow their own rhetorical rules, and often refuse to offer us straightforward information; and given the city's continuous settlement history that precludes large-scale excavations, archaeological data are comparatively sparse.Over the course of term, we shall discuss the following topics:1.\tThe Birth of a Capital: From Constantine to Justinian2.\tCircles of Decline and Renewal (626, 766, 1204, 1261, 1453), or: A Short History of Constantinople3.\tMethodological Challenges: Material and Textual Sources on Constantinople4.\tThe New Rome: Politics & Palaces5.\tThe New Jerusalem: Heavenly Protection for the Queen of Cities6.\tDiseases and Disasters: Plagues, Earthquakes & Heavy Winters7.\tProvisioning a Capital: Water, Grain & Vegetables, Livestock, Trade8.\tSchools & Theatra: Constantinople as a Hub of Learning9.\tCeremonial, Public Spectacles, and Processions10.\tSacred Topography and Spiritual Life in the Later Centuries11.\tThe Early Ottoman City: Imperial Transitions from Mehmet the Conqueror to SÃ¼leyman the Magnificent",

With regard to literature, the main focus will be on five ancient Roman authors/poets: Lucretius, Virgil, Ovid, Seneca and Pliny the Elder, but sections from works of other authors will also be examined as part of the general discussion.Seminars will explore the ways in which political and social factors influenced medical theories of the body, including gender systems, religious beliefs, and the political and social contexts within which medical issues were explored; the course will also, in turn, investigate how medical knowledge is propagated across various social classes and cultural contexts. Seminars will further be aimed at stimulating critical debate on broader questions about gender, identity, politics and ethics, while simultaneously challenging traditional assumptions about ancient cultural concepts.",

    "course_description": "The dissertation is an extended piece of work that investigates independently a topic or problem, body of evidence or text. It counts as the equivalent of two courses and has a credit weighting of 40 points. It is a freestanding project that is not connected to a particular course. It is not a postgraduate thesis, in which an original contribution is required, but it should represent an investigation of a chosen topic, carried out with a critical analysis and reasoned treatment of evidence and issues. The most distinctive feature and test of the dissertation is that it is up to the student to organise and see the project through to completion. While the supervisor will be an important resource for the student, the student, not the supervisor is in charge of the project. Success hinges on regular work and discipline.The procedure of preparing, researching and writing-up the dissertation is as follows:By the end of Year 3, students are required to propose a specific question for investigation, after consultation with a relevant member of staff. Over the summer each student will be assigned a supervisor for Year 4 and, as far as possible, should do most of the reading required for their project. In Sem 1 of Year 4 the student will meet with their supervisor and attend a number of seminars (e.g. on the planning and structure and on constructing an argument). Later that semester, students will be required to take part in presentations, that is, to present their topic to a small group of your fellow students and a member of staff. Students should be in regular contact with their supervisor throughout Year 4. It is not possible to change supervisors except in extreme circumstances.  The supervisor will give guidance, and may comment on a draft of part of the work, but never reads the whole work before submission.",

    "summary": "This course considers the synchronous developments of pro-independence conflict in Greece and the identification of Edinburgh as the 'Athens of the North' or 'Modern Athens'. It focuses particularly on how these two movements brokered their own identities with reference to and appropriation of classical antiquity and ideals of 'civilization'.",
    "course_description": "This course juxtaposes the reception of classical antiquity in Greece and Scotland in the period c.1770-1870. Two hundred years ago, in 1821, Greece broke out in a revolution that would disrupt four centuries of Ottoman rule. Exactly contemporaneously, Scottish cultural elites had begun calling Edinburgh the 'Athens of the North' and the 'Modern Athens'. These two contexts appear at first sight entirely separate; however, through the A.G. Leventis Foundation-funded exhibition at Edinburgh, 'Edina/Athena: The Greek Revolution and the Athens of the North, 1821-2021', the many links between Scotland and Greece in the revolutionary period are now being brought to light. Scots fought in the Greek Revolution; they wrote early histories of the conflict; they held political and civil office in the early Greek state; they responded to the spoken language of modern Greece by reforming the way they taught Classical Greek at home; they recreated and refashioned the art and architecture of Periclean Athens on Calton Hill and the Mound.This course places these contexts in critical perspective: What did the Greek Revolution mean for Greeks and the Scottish idealists who fought on Greece's behalf, and how did the Ottoman Empire fit into this picture? How were students at Scottish universities taught Greek language, history, art, and architecture, and what impact did this have on the intellectual and built environment of the 'Athens of the North'? In the context of the Leventis exhibition, what are the ethics of displaying cultural heritage collections, and how can we research and communicate the provenance of these collections with social and cultural awareness? How are such complex and often little-known topics best presented to a non-specialist audience? This course will encourage students to problematize the twin 'civilizing' narratives of (1) the bloody Greek fight for independence against a vilified and Orientalized Ottoman Empire and (2) the creation of a 'Modern Athens' in a Scotland simultaneously participating in the British imperial venture while also smarting from the thwarted Jacobite risingsof the previous century. Through its innovative assessment methods, this course will train students to communicate the complexities of these narratives in a public-facing manner, equipping them to engage sensitively with debates where the past is appropriated to serve present-day political and cultural agendas.",

    "summary": "Through the analysis of Late Byzantine visual and material culture, this course investigates Mediterranean cross-cultural pollination from the 13th to 15th centuries. It explores the long journey of objects, people and ideas, challenges the boundaries of rigid periodisation and offers alternative ways to look at the artistic production of Byzantium, Early Renaissance Europe and the Ottoman world.",
    "course_description": "This course explores the artistic interactions between Byzantium and Italy after 1261, when the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, was reconquered after 57 years of Latin occupation. The Byzantine emperor reinstalled in the former capital, Michael VIII Palaiologos, as well as most of his successors needed the political and religious support of the Latinate west to secure their reigns and the survival of the empire. In turn, the Italian states stressed their affiliation with the prestigious empire to secure their political status and maritime trades in the East. Political relationships, gift exchange, and people's mobility gradually generated a shared cultural and artistic language that impacted the visual culture of both the east and west and influenced subsequent developments.Through the analysis of architectural, sculptural, pictorial and decorative arts, this module contextualises the artistic and cultural cross-pollination between cities such as Assisi, Ferrara, Florence, Genoa, Constantinople, and Trebizond during the 13th to 15th centuries. The course will gradually reveal that the two worlds of the Latin west and the Greek-speaking east, which are generally investigated as separate cultural entities, were in fact deeply intertwined, and this affected the art produced in both. Similar patterns of the transmission of ideas (and objects) are discernible for the early Ottoman period, thus showing elements of continuity beyond the often-imposed narrative of modern national and chronological boundaries. The visual and material culture here reveals global trajectories that constantly overpass frontiers.",

    "course_description": "The course first introduces the theoretical and methodological issues involved in studying ancient popular culture before moving on to look in some detail at key themes in its study, including 'popular' leisure, spectacle, religion, literature and material and visual culture. Case-studies, including the evidence of Pompeii, the figure of Aesop, and literary sources ranging from various versions of the Hellenistic mime to late antique sermons form the focus of individual classes and seminars. In these classes students engage with a wide range of material - literary texts, images, graffiti, artefacts - as well as learning how to use to use (and assess the value of the use of) comparative, theoretical and methodological literature in their study of the past, an area in which ancient historians have often been weak.",

The first half of the course introduces students to Greek religious practices (e.g. sacrifice, prayer, sanctuaries, festivals), and to different modern theories that can be used to understand them. The second half of the course looks at Greek religious ideas, and examines how different authors (such as Aeschylus, Euripides and Herodotus) explore and question the religious conceptions of the society in which they lived. Rather than exploring these texts primarily from a literary perspective, this module provides the opportunity to understand how well-known works of classical literature emerged from the culture of which they were part.",

    "summary": "This course explores the history of engagement by women writers and artists with the place, idea, and myths of Greece. We first read ancient female writers -- preeminently Sappho -- and examine the representation of women in ancient texts; we then trace the multiple strategies through which \"Greece\" allows later women writers to assert their authority and authorship, question gender hierarchies and political/sociocultural paradigms, and lay a claim to the classical tradition. We consider how ancient writing affects contemporary understandings of identity and gender, and how modern works, from novels to plays to films, shape our view of the ancient world.",
    "course_description": "In \"Women, Writing, Greece\" we'll be looking at the history, influence, and reception of Greek literature through a female point of view. As we make our way through this history, the course will highlight the different perspectives and positions (in terms of gender identity, race, or even academic discipline and literary genre) from which women authors approach the \"classics.\" One important guiding figure throughout the course will be ancient poet Sappho, and the way in which her example informs -- even allows or authorizes -- later literatures, arts, identities, and sexualities; we'll be looking, for example, at the late-nineteenth-century Sapphic poems of \"Michael Field\" (joint penname of the lovers Katherine Bradley and Edith Cooper) and at the lesbian communities of Paris in the early twentieth century. By unraveling the complex gender and power dynamics of the past we will develop a better understanding of such issues in the present.We'll be thinking a lot about questions of access to a \"classical education\" -- as raised, e.g., by Virginia Woolf in A Room of One's Own and in \"On Not Knowing Greek,\" but also, in a different way, by the exceptional eighteenth-century example of the enslaved Phillis Wheatley or the nineteenth-century Greek writer Elisavet Moutzan-Martinengou. Similarly, we'll be thinking about who can claim a \"Greek\" identity, particularly through the examination of Modern Greek female writers. Consideration of translation, seen as a creative act but also often a gendered one, will form a large part of such conversations; all reading from languages other than English will be done in translation and we will be using female translators, examining their self-positioning towards Greek literature while also comparing selected excerpts with older and/or more traditional translations.",

The course will situate these poems in their literary, philosophical and socio-political contexts.

The teaching programme will approach these texts in chronological order (for the reason that the didactic tradition is a cumulative one in which each author engages closely with his predecessors). Within this structure, lectures and tutorials will aim to understand didactic as a genre and to practise certain critical methodologies of use in its study, with close analysis of selected texts and tutorial-style discussion of wider themes and contexts. The following eleven-week schedule (which may change according to the interests of the lecturer) will indicate the shape of the course in any given year:1. Introduction: didactic and epic2. Hesiod's Works and Days: structure and themes3. Hesiodic myth4. Hellenistic Didactic (Aratus, Nicander, Callimachus): more than a jeu d'esprit?5. Lucretius' De Rerum Natura: philosophical and literary sources6. Lucretius: atoms and void; the soul and death; epistemology; love; civilization and the world,7.

And when Humanity lands there, it looks out, and, seeing a better country, sets sail. Progress is the realisation of Utopias.\"- Oscar Wilde, The Soul of Man under Socialism, 1891Since antiquity, when Europeans have tried to advance new visions of society, or criticize old ones, they have often used utopias to dramatise their concerns. Utopias can be at once, literally, 'noplaces' or 'good-places'. We see them today in space operas, dystopian dramas, apocalyptic thrillers, political speeches, and even 'histories of the future'. This course addresses significant examples that once linked political dreams to contemporary anxieties, from the ancient Eastern Mediterranean to early modern England, giving equal weight to classical and early modern texts.Our mode of analysis will be historical, with a focus on social and intellectual contexts. Therefore, we will proceed by careful reading of the evidence, with a focus on a main primary source each week. Seminars will discuss each example in relation to its local political concerns while also exploring the formation of the genre more fully.This course is co-taught with Dr Benedikt Eckhardt in Classics.",

    "summary": "The Greek and Roman texts studied in this course (in translation) are referred to as 'didactic' poems because they set out ostensibly to teach a specific skill or branch of knowledge, e.g., justice (Hesiod), Epicurean philosophy (Lucretius), farming (Virgil), and techniques in courtship and seduction (Ovid). The course will situate these poems in their literary, philosophical and socio-political contexts. Attention will be given to how each successive poet handles a range of themes, including myth and religion, the origins and development of mankind, and the human propensity for love and war.",
    "course_description": "The didactic poems studied in this course will typically include Hesiod's Works and Days, Lucretius' On the Nature of the Universe, Virgil's Georgics, and Ovid's Art of Love. The teaching programme will approach these texts in chronological order (for the reason that the didactic tradition is a cumulative one in which each author engages closely with his predecessors). Within this structure, lectures and tutorials will aim to understand didactic as a genre and to practise certain critical methodologies of use in its study, with close analysis of selected texts and tutorial-style discussion of wider themes and contexts. The following eleven-week schedule (which may change according to the interests of the lecturer) will indicate the shape of the course in any given year:1. Introduction: didactic and epic2. Hesiod's Works and Days: structure and themes3. Hesiodic myth4. Hellenistic Didactic (Aratus, Nicander, Callimachus): more than a jeu d'esprit?5. Lucretius' De Rerum Natura: philosophical and literary sources6. Lucretius: atoms and void; the soul and death; epistemology; love; civilization and the world,7. Virgil's Georgics: 'labor' and Italy8. Virgil: 'amor' and politics9. Ovid's Ars Amatoria: elegiac and didactic traditions10. Ovid's lessons on politics and society11. Overview and conclusion",

In the first year it will run as 'Homer and Hesiod from a Comparative Perspective', but the model can be used for other ancient texts and their comparanda in subsequent years.",
    "course_description": "The first run will centre on the Homeric and Hesiodic corpora and their comparanda. Through a range of comparative material from different cultures and time periods, the course will set the canonical works of Homer and Hesiod in their wider context in terms of genre and tradition. Comparisons with South Slavic song will allow students to explore issues of orality and performance, acquainting them with the work of Parry and Lord and the importance to Homeric studies of the oral-traditional hypothesis. Students will experience South Slavic song as a performative genre through recordings. Comparisons with material from the Near East will set the genres of epic, cosmogony and wisdom against a traditional backdrop, introducing students to interactions between Greece and the Near East and the possible routes of cultural exchange. Later comparative material from Scandinavia will then bring the focus back to the issue of orality, and students will begin to distinguish between direct/indirect routes of transmission, and cultures that are separate but comparable. The course will culminate in an essay that aims to give students the freedom to choose their own independent comparative study. Classes will introduce them to methodology, to scholarship and to sample material, on which they will build independently in their chosen comparison.",

By exploring a representative selection of episodes from Ovid's Metamorphoses (in translation), we will study the concepts, functions, and criticism of the human body and its transformation in the Greco-Roman world.",
    "course_description": "Ovid's epic will be our point of reference and point of departure in exploring the plurality of ancient theories of the body, the contexts in which they were conceptualised in the Greco-Roman world, and the ways in which Ovid manipulated them to serve new purposes. Seminars will also engage with the ways in which Ovid's work has been influenced by political and social factors which have shaped ancient theories of the body, including gender systems, religious beliefs, and the political and social contexts within which medical issues concerning the human body were explored. More specifically, we will investigate the influence of ancient philosophy, medicine, gender theories, and literature more broadly, especially Greek tragedy, on Ovid's account of bodily transformations. Seminars will further be aimed at stimulating critical debate on broader questions about gender, identity, politics and ethics, while simultaneously challenging traditional assumptions about ancient cultural concepts. While the primary focus will be on the classical sources and contexts, the various interests and disciplinary backgrounds that members of the class may bring to the subject will be integral to the module.",

We will analyse a wide variety of ancient written sources in relation to the events they describe and their contemporary contexts and contemplate the utility of modern approaches to ancient civil strife. We will explore extracts from a range of prose and verse texts relating to the Late Republican and Early Imperial civil wars, consider the diachronic and cross-generic evolution of key civil war tropes and motifs, and scrutinize cross-generational attempts to comprehend war, its origins, and its aftermath.",

We will read a range of texts that deal with a wide variety of epistolary subjects: these will include Cicero's and Pliny's letters to friends and political allies, the philosophical letters of Plato, Epicurus and Seneca the Younger, the playful verse letters of the poets Horace and Ovid, and the less literary letters written by soldiers in Vindolanda in Northern England. The module will offer a chronological as well as thematic approach to ancient letters. We will discuss ancient epistolary theory and its limits, the authenticity of the material and the strategies of pseudepigraphical literature, parody and paratext, self-representation and biographical elements in letter-writing as well as the role of privacy and friendship. The module will pay particular attention to the organisation of ancient letters in collections and analyse the role that narrative, distance and chronology play in letter collections.",

    "summary": "Satire is an entertaining, provocative, and powerful literary genre that the Romans claimed as their own invention. This course will focus (in translation) on the satirists of the late Republic and early Empire, including Lucilius, Horace, Persius, Seneca the Younger, and Juvenal; modern descendants will also feature. Alongside questions of genre and literary technique, attention will be given to historical and sociopolitical contexts: satiric themes include society, morality, class, politics, authority, freedom of speech, patronage, literature, food, sex, and obscenity.",
    "course_description": "The satiric authors studied in this course will typically include Horace, Persius, Seneca and Juvenal. The teaching programme is broadly divided into two phases: the first will introduce the satirists in chronological order, examining in each case what and when they wrote, and looking at what the satirists themselves say about their genre; the second part of the course will focus on a number of themes common to each of the satirists. Within this structure, lectures and workshops will aim to understand satire as a genre and to practise certain critical methodologies of use in its study, with close analysis of selected texts and tutorial-style discussion of wider themes and contexts. The following eleven-week schedule (which may change according to the interests of the lecturer) will give an indication of the shape of the course in any given year:Week 1: Introduction: what is satire?; approaches to satire ancient and modernWeek 2: Horace: text & context; programmatic satireWeek 3: Persius: text & context; programmatic satireWeek 4: Seneca: text & context; programmatic satireWeek 5: Juvenal: text & context; programmatic satireWeek 6: Workshops: using commentaries and writing critical analysesWeek 7: Satiric themes: patronage and foodWeek 8: Satiric themes: gender and sexualityWeek 9: Satiric themes: town and country; philosophyWeek 10: Satiric themes: epic parody; classWeek 11: Conclusion and overview",

From there onwards, Roman tragedy in particular enjoyed a steady popularity and became a prominent feature of Rome's cultural landscape. In this course, we will trace the development of Roman tragedy from its birth to its death (or, rather, disappearance), that is from the fragments of the early tragedians to the only complete Latin tragedies written by Seneca the Younger and the last extant and complete example of the genre, the Octavia.",
    "course_description": "We will study, in translation, the tragic fragments of Rome's earliest tragedians Livius Andronicus, Gnaeus Naevius, Quintus Ennius, Marcus Pacuvius and Lucius Accius and familiarise ourselves with the methodical challenges of reading and interpreting fragments. The greater part of the course will be dedicated to Seneca's tragedies, the only tragedies in Latin that have survived intact. We will read 6 of his tragedies (out of 8 surviving tragedies): Phaedra, Oedipus, Medea, Trojan Women, Hercules Furens, Thyestes. To give a well-rounded picture of Roman tragedy, we will also study the only fabula praetexta that has survived in full: the Octavia, which was penned by an anonymous author.The wide range of texts will provide students with a good understanding of the genre and familiarise them with the different historical and social circumstances in which they were written and performed. Seminars will aim to stimulate critical debate beyond the texts and to engage the students with broader questions about ethics, politics and gender. Students will further develop their close reading skills as well as their ability to understand abstract concepts and to process complex information.",

    "course_description": "Although the novel is often regarded as a post-Renaissance phenomenon and was not recognised as a high literary form by ancient critics, a number of examples survive from the ancient world, in some cases only fragmentarily. Whereas previously many classicists had regarded the ancient novel as peripheral, since the 1970s it has been attracting ever-increasing scholarly interest, and is now much more widely taught as part of a Classics undergraduate curriculum. The course will concentrate on the rise of the Greek novel and the contingent cultural and literary phenomena of the so-called Second Sophistic, and will examine too the nature, origins and peculiarity of the Roman novel. Students will normally read (in translation) all of Longus' Daphnis and Chloe, Petronius' Satyricon, Apuleius' Metamorphoses and excerpts of the works of Achilles Tatius, Chariton and Lucian.",

In the transition between republic and autocracy, Tiberius' accession (AD 14) marks a crucial moment which deserves more attention. This course aims at investigating the history of the first hereditary Princeps, his enigmatic character, the works of literature emerged in his time, and reflect on the development of his reputation throughout the ages.",
    "course_description": "In the course students are trained to combine close reading of the sources with broad class discussions. The works considered are Augustan sources (e.g. Ovid) and the two almost complete books of historiographical nature that emerged under Tiberius' rule, Velleius Paterculus' universal history from the aftermath of the Trojan war to the reign of Tiberius and Valerius Maximus' Facta et dicta memorabilia, a nine-book collection of more than a thousand exempla. Their portrayal of Augustus' later years and of Tiberius is compared to other (near) contemporary sources such as Seneca the Elder's declamations, Phaedrus' Fables, and it is informed by coinage and documents (e.g. the exceptionalSenatus Consultum de Cn. PisonePatre) and works originated in non-Roman contexts (Josephus, Philo of Alexandria). The core of Tiberius' portrayal is seen in Tacitus' Annals, Suetonius' biography of Tiberius, and Cassius Dio's Roman History. Students are exposed to a wide array of texts and not limited to the canonical sources on Tiberius and are thus trained to think across literary genres, epochs, and socio-cultural contexts and to deep their knowledge of the various authors' style, themes, and narrative techniques.",

There is good reason for this: it is here that Aristotle addresses fundamental questions about virtue, happiness, and human reason. In doing so, he establishes much of the framework subsequent discussion in ethics adopts.",
    "course_description": "This course intends to introduce students to Aristotle's ethical project through a close reading of his most well-known text on moral philosophy, the Nicomachean Ethics. This works presents some of his most compelling discussions in ethics, e.g. on the 'end' of human life, habituation, friendship, and the striking connections made between contemplation, virtue, and happiness.The course's structure is two-fold. (1.) Close attention will be paid to Aristotle's development of his widely celebrated and contested ethical concerns. We will closely examine how Aristotle's approach to moral philosophy follows from his commitments in his metaphysical, psychology, and biological works. This is only natural as Aristotle is a peculiarly systematic philosopher who draws on connections between different aspects of his body of work. (2.) In conjunction with a broader consideration of the EN, this careful inquiry into its arguments and language will be supplemented by a look at how the EN has fundamentally shaped moral philosophy pursued in its wake. The ancient reception of the Ethics, and the developments of e.g. Thomism and modern 'virtue ethics', will all be considered in light of Aristotle's text. As such, sessions will be devoted to how the work's distinctive framework (i.e. how it ties habituation, the emotions, practical wisdom, virtue and happiness together) structures subsequent traditions of moral philosophy from antiquity to the present.",

    "summary": "By far the most detailed account of the late Roman state and its emperors comes from the history of Ammianus Marcellinus, completed in ca. 390 and covering in the surviving books the years AD 353 to 378 and the emperors Constantius II, Julian, Jovian, Valentinian I, and Valens. This course focuses on an in-depth study of Ammianus' work and the Roman world he describes.",
    "course_description": "The course offers an in-depth study of a historian notable both for brilliant writing and his acute and tendentious perspective on a crucial period of Roman history. Ammianus Marcellinus' Res Gestae originally covered the history of the Roman empire from the accession of Nerva onwards, but only the books covering his own times (AD 353-378) survive. Ammianus' work is unique, but he himself exemplifies the diversity and mobility of the international elite of the Roman empire post-Constantine: a pagan serving under Christian emperors, a Greek-speaker who wrote a Latin history, a Syrian who travelled throughout the Roman world as a high ranking officer and retired to Rome. Thanks to Ammianus, the history of the third quarter of the fourth century AD is one of the best attested periods of Roman history, and the course will explore both what Ammianus can tell us about the Roman world of his time and how he can mislead us. The course will provide insights into themes including the workings of the late Roman state, the Christianisation of Roman society, and the place of classical literature and historical memory in Roman identity. The course will develop students' knowledge of a fascinating period and their skills in political and social history and in reading elaborate literary texts in their historical context.",

    "course_description": "This course will introduce students to the study of the orators, examining the corpora, legal processes and technical language. Throughout its history, Athens experienced a high volume of litigation. There were trials of unsuccessful generals and corrupt politicians and disputes arising from family matters like marriage, inheritance, and adoption. The courts also heard cases about citizenship, maritime trade, mining contracts, quarrels between neighbours, treason and murder. The preserved speeches of the Attic orators delivered in court cover all aspects of life in Athens and are one of our richest sources of evidence for life in the Greek world. Through close reading of a selection of speeches of the orators the students will familiarize themselves, and learn to engage with, the social and economic reality of classical Athens, while at the same time acquiring skills necessary to understand and exploit challenging course material. They will be faced with key issues of Athenian and Greek legal, social and economic history that are at the core of the current research of the course organizers.List of topics:IntroductionSolon and the Law in Archaic GreeceAthenian Legal and Political InstitutionsLegislative Procedure in Classical AthensLegal Procedure in Classical AthensInterpreting the Law: the problem of fairness and consistencyHomicide Law: The Role of ReligionFamily, Marriage, and InheritanceAdoption and GuardianshipMoicheia and Sexual ViolenceIs Antigones right?

Murena on a bribery charge, his later defence of an alleged conspirator P. Sulla, and the historian Sallust's account of the conspiracy written twenty years afterwards. In addition to supplying historical information, these sources also represent the best and most exciting oratory and historiography of the late republic.The course will develop students' ability to interpret Roman history of the late republic through detailed study of a particularly full range of sources while also developing their understanding and appreciation of some of the best known classics of Roman literature.",

    "summary": "In the Nineteenth Century the world economy underwent decisive changes with the emergence of modern industrialisation and modern forms of economic development. We consider the question \"what made it all happen - in some economies to a far greater extent that in others?\" What, for example, were the mechanisms which assisted or hindered the diffusion of the new technologies and what sort of institutional changes were required to support the forces of industrialisation? Did trade, and the movements of peoples and capital, promote income growth and convergence, or, in some cases did the forces of globalization lead to income inequalities?",
    "course_description": "The initial focus is on the emergence of the industrial core and its relationship with the wider world. By 1914 the USA was the world industrial leader, with industrial output equal to that of France, Germany and Britain combined. Accordingly the case of US economic development is considered in some detail. Global economic history is not just a history of the industrial core, though, and accordingly Chinese and Japanese economic history are also studied in some detail. In the twentieth century, elements of the world economy disintegrated during the 1920s and 1930s, most especially the networks of trade and the international monetary system. The led to widespread depression, including in the USA, and we seek to understand what went wrong. The course concludes with a discussion of a second era of global economic expansion since 1945.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. The course organiser has not identified any sensitive content within this course's focus, however course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

At the same time is explores the emergence and expansion of the book trade in both England and Scotland. The growth of printers, bookbinders and booksellers over the early modern period was cause and effect of the elaboration and diversification of the publishing industry. In particular, attention will be paid to the production, distribution and contents of the cheapest forms of print, made from just one or two sheets of paper. Single-sheet works were the mass media of the period: cried on urban streets by hawkers and distributed through the countryside by chapmen, they sold for just a penny or two and encompassed all people in a national print network.Broadsides, handbills and 'small books' were run off presses in thousands of editions and millions of individual copies. Despite this, relatively few have survived since they were poorly printed, rarely bound, and inherently ephemeral. Sufficient examples remain, nevertheless, in order to provide a representative sample of their form and content. Recent digitisation projects have made significant amounts of such material readily available. The course considers the ballads and songs, stories and jokes, religious teachings and moral guidance, practical advice and astrological predictions, news reports and political propaganda, woodcuts images and printers' devices, that feature in these diverse and eclectic publications. It analyses what this content can tell us about the mentalities and beliefs, attitudes and aspirations, of the majority of the population in early modern society.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. The course organiser has not identified any sensitive content within this course's focus, however course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "summary": "This course examines the experience of criminal justice, policing and systems of punishment from c. 1800 to 2000, focusing on Great Britain and Ireland (located within a broader global context). It centres on three core questions: Who has had access to 'justice' and with what effects? Who has enforced 'law and order' and on whose behalf? What has been the purpose of penal policy and what difference has it made?",
    "course_description": "This course combines exploration of key debates in criminal justice history and historical criminology (relating to security, crime prevention, access to justice and civil liberties) with indepth analysis of primary source materials (including official documents, court reports, newspaper coverage and cultural representations). By examining a period of 200 years it maps changes in policing, criminal justice and penal/welfare policy - as a set of ideals and as lived experience - in relation to broader political, social, economic and cultural transformations (including (post)colonialism, liberalism, the rise of mass democracy, consumerism and total war). The course considers the intersection of class, gender, race, ethnicity, religion and age in shaping identities, subjectivities, and experiences across time.As well as developing understanding of the institutions of law, police, criminal justice and punishment in modern Great Britain and Ireland, the course will develop skills in researching and analysing primary sources (including quantitative data, visual imagery and film).Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: crime, violence, policing, corporal and capital punishment, sexuality. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

By examining the period from 1750 to the present, we can chart the 'rise' (and arguably 'fall') of a formal - and increasingly specialised - medical profession, and the increasing power they have wielded over many aspects of our daily lives, from birth to death. We will deconstruct their theories and approaches to consider what beliefs and values have shaped their use of the labels 'healthy', 'normal' and 'diseased', and the impact on patients.Students will gain direct access to significant local archival collections - Lothian Health Services Archive, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh - as well as major digitisation projects undertaken by bodies such as the Science Museum and Wellcome Library.

    "summary": "The documentary has been described as 'Britain's outstanding contribution to the film'. From early local topicals which offered audience members the chance to 'see yourselves as others see you', to more structured treatments of contemporary issues, the documentary offers a powerful record of society and social change across the twentieth century.",
    "course_description": "This course examines the development of the documentary film from the first days of public screenings of moving pictures to the early 1980s. It is concerned with the earliest actualities, often comprising local scenes familiar to audiences, which provided the basis for cinema's initial popularity in the late 1890s. It also examines the role of documentary as a source of propaganda during war, encouraging a united sense of national purpose and giving expression in 1939-45 to the idea of a 'People's War'. In the first semester, particular attention is paid to the emergence of an organised movement of documentary film-making, informed by the ideas of the Scot, John Grierson; while the second semester follows the continued impact of his ideas in the post-war years, along with moves to develop an alternative, less consensual approach to film-making in the Free Cinema movement of the mid 1950s.The course will introduce students to the work of documentary film-makers, through the films themselves, the thinking behind them, explored in the writings of those active in the industry, the records of the organisations promoting production, as well as, where appropriate, the critical and popular reception of their output. Students will also gain direct access to major archival collections in Stirling (the John Grierson and Lindsay Anderson Collections) and Glasgow (the Moving Image Archive, which holds material detailing the production of the Films of Scotland Committee, and the early films made on Shetland by Jenny Brown). Assessed work will encourage engagement with both cinematic and written materials to shape a rounded appreciation of documentary film and the record it provides of social change across the twentieth century.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: the films studied on this course inevitably contain images and language which reflect attitudes of the period in which they were made.

It should be of equal interest to aspiring economic, social and intellectual historians, and is well suited for interdisciplinary study. It is envisaged both as a purely financial history course, but also as an analysis of contemporary discourse on matters of finance and the wider economy. The course gives strong emphasis to crisis episodes. Financial innovation and financial crisis have an inherently symbiotic relationship. The first can often create the conditions for the outbreak and propagation of financial distress. Crises in their own turn inform contemporary discourse, and often aid lead to the adoption of regulatory and financial responses, to the development of economic thought, and to the evolution of cultural tropes that enter the collective mind-set.The main geographical focus will be on Britain and the United States, but the Netherlands, France, and Italy enter this story both as originators/imitators of Anglo-Saxon institutions and practices, and as geographical locations where the various crises under investigation either originated or later spread to from initial Anglo-Saxon outbreaks. Students will be introduced to a number of theoretical frameworks explaining capitalist innovation, government regulation of finance, and financial bubbles and crises, and to a variety of primary sources residing in physical archives in Edinburgh and in digital repositories.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: suicide. There is a discussion on the literary trope of financier suicide (particularly the stereotype of bankers jumping out of high windows) during financial crises. This is not a matter that is central to the course, but it is instructive. I always provide a trigger warning ahead of time.

    "summary": "The course uses leisure, the manner in which free time was used and organised to investigate wider economic, social and cultural changes in Britain in the period from industrialisation to the later nineteenth century. In the process, the importance of differing experiences, according to class, age, gender, national and regional identities are also explored.",
    "course_description": "Social and economic changes provide the essential context for the course. The period from about 1780 to 1880 marked the transformation of Britain from a largely rural society, structured around small towns and villages, to a substantially urban society, with a population increasingly located in large towns and cities. In terms of leisure, it witnessed a shift from what might be termed a 'traditional' to a recognisably  'modern' leisure culture- from a leisure calendar made up of occasional, mostly local events, to one in which events which were more national in scope and more regular, both in terms of the frequency with which they took place and the order by which they were conducted, bounded by formal sets of rules. By the 1880s, many of what we would think of as modern leisure forms were in place. Definite limits were placed on the length of the working week, providing increasingly fixed and predictable times for leisure. The same applied to leisure during year, with the introduction of fixed Bank Holidays across the country from the 1870s. It also saw the emergence of 'national' leisure forms: Music Hall; holidaymaking; the rise of national sporting events familiar today. Various themes may be seen to run through the topics, including the balance between change and continuity in society, the means by which change occurred, the impact of class differences, and the importance of continued tensions within as well as between the classes. The course thus offers a distinctive take on themes central to the social and economic history of modern Britain.Course note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. The course organiser has not identified any sensitive content within this course's focus, however course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "course_description": "Eighteenth-century London was a marvel of the age, in Britain and beyond, because of its size, innovation and spectacle.  Contemporaries were preoccupied with London as a place and idea and it is estimated that as many as 1:6 Britons lived in London at some stage in their life. Modern historians have mirrored this interest, with many of the high profile and innovative digital engagements with the past, famously exemplified by the Old Bailey Online project, having a London focus.  This course offers a survey of some of the major recent themes in the study of London life in the 18th century, taking a social and cultural history approach with a focus on the use and interpretation of a wide variety of sources including personal testimony, court records, contemporary fiction and material and visual resources.  Each theme is also explored through a close reading of key texts that allow students to better understand the historiographical evolution of scholarly and popular understandings of London. The intellectual point of departure for this course is the pioneering work of Dorothy George (1878-1971) whose study, London Life in the Eighteenth Century (1925) and subsequent British Museum catalogue of political and social print satires, published between 1935 and 1954, provided the foundation for modern scholarly research on and understandings of London.  The main themes are migration and emigration; court life; professional culture; the mob; print culture; sex and satire; luxury and spectacle; crime and violence; domestic life and houses; spaces of modernity.",

    "summary": "The course examines the uses and organisation of free time in the early twentieth century, the first point in British history when a majority of the population would enjoy regular access to organised leisure activities. The nature of these pursuits is examined to cast light on wider social and economic developments across the period.",
    "course_description": "The image of the 'mass' and the ideas associated with it provide a central theme of this part of the course. At one level, the language of the 'mass' reflects a reality of popular leisure in this period: its often collective nature. People attended sports events, music halls, cinemas and went on holiday in large and ever increasing numbers. Leisure experiences were increasingly shared, and the question must be asked how far this contributed to a growing sense of collective identity in this period. However, the image of the 'mass', as it recurs through the writing of the period, also reflects contemporary concern that increased access to leisure would threaten established cultural standards. As working-class living standards improved, money and time were devoted to amusements which did not match the priorities of moral reformers: drink remained central to working-class culture; instead of classical concerts, more people went to the Music Hall; instead of participating in team sports, most preferred to pay to watch others play. For moral reformers, it appeared that improving, rational amusements were in danger of being swamped by commercial forces. The creation of a mass market for leisure would, it was thought, inevitably lead to a fall in standards, as minority tastes lost out before the economic power wielded by the majority. Such fears were shared on both the left and right of the political spectrum. The course therefore uses the use and organisation of leisure time to examine important themes of social and economic change in the early twentieth century.Weekly Topics List:1: Introduction.2: Leisure in a Changing Economy.3: Leisure and Working-class Identity.4: Leisure and Gender: the female perspective.5: Leisure and Youth.6: Essay Preparation- formative feedback on essay plans.7: Organised Sport.8: Cinema.9: Gambling.10: Leisure and National Identity.11: Guidance on Gobbet.",

    "summary": "Technological change motivated by the pursuit of productivity gains is viewed as the holy grail of economic growth, leading to the First Industrial Revolution in Britain. This course reconsiders technological change in the manufacturing of cotton textiles and porcelain products in Britain, two processed goods from the East that represented and facilitated modern economic growth in Britain.",
    "course_description": "Theories abound on why the First Industrial Revolution was British. Many of them argue, with varying degrees of stress on causal factors, that Britain industrialised because it was able to make certain commodities faster and cheaper, enabling a lead within the global economy that allowed it to break through the Malthusian frontier, triggering modern economic growth. What role did the import substitution of products previously imported from Asia play in stimulating technological change, and consequently the onset of modern economic growth? Taking two key commodities of the Early Modern global economy as test cases (cotton textiles from India and porcelain goods from China) we assess from week to week how the import substitution of these products led to technological change and eventually industrialisation. Students taking the course will critically consider mainstream productivity-based theories on technological change in economic history as well as new revisionist work that challenges this view from a global and material perspective.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: imperialism, colonialism, slave trade. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "course_description": "Over the course of the 19th Century, the production and consumption of alcohol in Britain and Ireland were transformed from a rural activity connected to local agriculture to a more recognisably modern industry increasingly serving the domestic urban and export markets. By the turn of the 20th Century, the liquor market featured strong brands for which the image of cultural exotica (especially an idealised image of Scotland and Ireland) had become as important as the consistent flavour of the product itself; while producers and regulators strove to legally define the characteristics of consumer products whose household names were now valuable commercial property. Throughout the same period the opposition to the social and health impact of alcohol use also crystallised into a strong temperance movement that became increasingly conflated with aspects of the broader womenÂ¿s movement.This Honours level option course examines the formative period of this important and controversial industry through a close engagement with a wide range of primary sources.

    "summary": "This course explores the trajectory of Chinese economic history from the establishment of the People's Republic of China until the present day, complementing approaches of economic and political history with those of social, cultural, and intellectual history. From the early days of central planning, to the People's Republic of China's accession to the World Trade Organization, via the heydays of Maoism and Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms of the 1980s, this is a class on modern economic Chinese history for anyone interested in understanding one of the most important actors in today's world economy.",
    "course_description": "This course analyses the development of China's economy between ideology and economic necessity, dramatic failure and extraordinary success. This part of the course covers the period since 1949, when the People's Republic of China was established. In the early 1950s, the new People's Republic of China looked set to become a planned economy on the Soviet model; but a few years later, Mao Zedong launched the 'Great Leap Forward', a developmental policy that may well have been one of the most disastrous economic experiments of the 20th century. The PRC had hardly recovered from the 'Great Leap Forward' when it was devastated by the 'Cultural Revolution', an all-consuming political campaign, the scars of which are visible in China to the present day. And yet, one only needs to open a newspaper these days to be reminded of the supposed threat which China's economic development poses to the developed economies. How was this astonishing economic recovery possible? In this course, we will trace the story of the PRC's economy, from planned economy through Maoist utopia to its present perceived glories; by the end of the semester, students will have developed an understanding of why the history of China's economic development is crucial to making sense of today's global economy.

The contributions of young people have come to be viewed as integral to the study of western economies. Furthermore, children and young people have been reclaimed as historical actors and even agents of change. Topics covered include the discovery of childhood; autobiography and memory; child poverty, child-saving and juvenile delinquency; school, family, work and migration; debates relating to child marriage in India and the age of consent. We will consider, throughout, the ways in which ideas about class, gender, race and age have structured adult interventions and youthful experience. The role of the law, medicine, religion and education will be explored throughout. We will also assess the problem of finding the real child in the archive because his/her traces are so often transitory.

It analyses what this engaging form of source material reveals about social attitudes, political ideas, and cultural life in Georgian England.

    "course_description": "This honours course explores a variety of the printed images that were produced in England between 1700 and 1830. This was a 'golden age' in the history of English art in general and of graphic satire in particular. Some 20,000 examples of single-sheet images were published in London between 1760 and 1820 alone. Many concern political themes and feature the individuals, events, and scandals that dominated British national life. Others provide social commentary, exposing the follies, foibles and fashions of all manner of people. Still others offer information, instruction, and decoration. Taken together they amount to a huge and rich corpus of material that reveals much about the issues, sentiments and prejudices that characterised eighteenth-century public opinion and popular culture.The course will develop skills of identifying the major artists, engravers and publishers who created and disseminated these images. It will help students to recognise the various techniques involved in their production, including engraving, etching, and mezzotint. Themes to be explored will include the circumstances that lay behind the making of graphic art, the audiences at which it was aimed, and the impact that it had. These classes will seek to interpret the intricate symbolism and coded messages that this material often contained, and investigate the contemporary social, political and cultural contexts that help to explain its meanings.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

The course content is as follows:A) IDEAS ABOUT WOMEN1.     Introduction2.     Women's legal status: Treatises and court records3.     Religious teachings: Sermons and exempla4.     Scientific ideas: Medical texts5.     Education: Conduct texts6.     Structured learning activity: formative feedbackB) GENDER AND SOCIAL STATUS7.     Peasant women I: coroners rolls8.     Peasant women II: manor court rolls9.     Urban women I: Guild regulations10.  Urban women II: Borough court rolls11.  After the Black Death: Sessions of the peace12.  Gentry:  Paston lettersC) GENDER AND LIFECYCLE (using a mixture of sources)13.  Childbirth14.  Life-cycle service15.  Motherhood16.  Marriage17.  Widowhood18.  Structured learning active: formative feedbackD) WOMEN AND RELIGION19. Book of Margery Kempe20. Women's wills21. Women and heresy: Lollard trials22. Women and the cult of saintsContent note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: sexual violence. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "summary": "This course examines the printed images that were produced in London during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It analyses what this graphic form of source material reveals about political opinion and religious belief, social attitudes and cultural life in Tudor and Stuart England. This was a formative era in print making and such a powerful medium reflects some of the major events and significant forces that transformed British national life during the early modern period.",
    "course_description": "This honours course explores the variety of printed images that were produced in London between 1500 and 1700. This was a seminal age in print making and established the techniques and topics that were to define the medium thereafter. Tudor and Stuart England witnessed momentous events such as the Reformation, the Civil Wars, and the Glorious Revolution. At the same time, it experienced significant change in economy, society and culture. These signal developments are reflected in the graphic art of the period which provides a medium through which to explore the forces that transformed life in Britain during the early modern era.The course will develop skills of identifying the major artists, engravers and publishers who created and disseminated these images. It will help students to recognise the various techniques involved in their production, including woodcut, engraving, etching, and mezzotint. Themes to be explored will include the circumstances that lay behind the making of graphic art, the audiences at which it was aimed, and the impact that it had. These classes will seek to interpret the intricate symbolism and coded messages that this material often contained, and investigate the contemporary political, religious, and social contexts that help to explain its meaning and influence.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. The course organiser has not identified any sensitive content within this course's focus, however course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

We will concentrate especially on the 1640s and 1650s, when people in England, Scotland, and Ireland fought a series of gory wars, Parliament executed the king, and the Interregnum regimes attempted to carry out a godly reformation. We will then trace the fallout of these events through the Restoration, with its series of crises around religious toleration, colonial expansion, and international wars. Our core questions will be: what was revolutionary about this era, why did revolution occur, and with what results? Students will learn to think historically with different perspectives, considering the view from, for instance, Belfast, Ireland and Port Royal, Jamaica as well as Edinburgh and Westminster. They will sample the techniques of the case study, the comparison, the analysis of large sets of text through quantification, and the deep contextualization and close reading of language. Our approach to revolution will draw not only on political history, but also social, economic, military, and legal history.Students will spend each session analysing and proposing their own interpretations of the primary source evidence. These sources vary from constitutional documents, state correspondence, and political pamphlets, to records from court cases, local church meetings, and trading corporations.",

The theme of commemoration will be addressed. A recent theme in the historiography, eg in Adrian Gregory's The Last Great War, has been the examination of the effect of the conflict in a local context. The resources of the NAS and the NLS provide opportunities for original student work in this area.

    "summary": "The course will ask how early modern people defined, applied, and resisted coercion in labour relations in the British Atlantic world context. We will place transatlantic chattel slavery at the core of the course and also consider indigenous slavery, compulsory agrarian and domestic service, convict labour, indentured servitude, pauper apprenticeship, prostitution, and military and naval conscription. Students will learn the many ways in which historians approach the problem of forced labour.",
    "course_description": "The first part of this course focuses on labour coercion in terms of belonging and exclusion in communities in the British Isles, West Africa, and Indigenous America. Particular focus will be on agrarian, domestic, and military labour. We will challenge the presiding impression that Europe was a place of liberty while Africa and America were places of slavery. The second part of the course focuses on the commodification of labour, especially in long-distance transportation, foregrounding the transatlantic and Indigenous slave trades. Students will learn how traders in captives used violence, displacement, broken kin ties, and imprisonment to establish slavery. Enslaved people's suffering, coping, resistance, and rebellion took as many various forms, making it impossible for enslavers to forget their victims' humanity. The third part of the course will consider the role of coerced laborers in the process of colonisation. Enslaved and forced labour altered natural environments as well as political systems. Work, from the construction of plantations to the overfishing of the sea, contributed to indigenous dispossession and further coercion of indigenous labour, and enabled and accelerated the rise of racial capitalism, with implications on all sides of the Atlantic rim. The course then ends at the Age of Revolutions, treating the role of labour coercion and resistance not only in political and social revolutions, but also in the industrial revolution and attendant environmental change.",

Two prose texts will be read in depth: Longus' pastoral novel 'Daphnis and Chloe', which describes two young rustics and their quest to consummate their love, and Lucian's satirical 'The True Histories', one of the first works of science fiction. The course will set these texts within the cultural and literary phenomena which characterise the early Imperial period, and will discuss them according to the characteristics of their respective genres, with particular attention paid to the rhetorical and philosophical aspects of the texts and their allusive play with literary predecessors, and close attention given to narrative structure and prose style and diction.",

This course will uncover the origins and development of bucolic poetry as a genre, within which the traditional view of Theocritus as founder of the genre will be situated. The majority of the Idylls will be read and discussed in detail, with particular attention paid to the cultural context of Ptolemaic Alexandria, the representation and implications of patronage, the presenceand functionof lower literary registers such as mime, and in particular the non-elite and female voices in the poems. Students will engage in close reading of (principally) Greek hexameter poetry in Doric dialect, and will develop their knowledge of literary genre and generic hybridity, their reading and understanding of programme in poetry and above all their ability to recognise and relate intertextuality. Shorter excerpts of later Hellenistic poets Moschus and Bion will also be read.",

    "course_description": "In this course we will read most of Hesiod's Theogony and Works and Days in Greek, as well as discussing the poems in their entirety, along with selections from the Catalogue of Women, Shield of Heracles, or other Hesiodic fragments. Study of the Greek text will work in conjunction with thematic discussions of topics such as Hesiod's poetics and metapoetics, his moral concepts, his attitude to women - and whether or not he ever existed. The Hesiodic poems will be set in their generic and traditional framework, and will be considered from a comparative perspective to locate them within global literature.",

    "summary": "Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics (EN) is certainly the most widely read and taught work of ancient moral philosophy in the English-speaking world. There is good reason for this: it is here that Aristotle addresses fundamental questions about virtue, happiness, and human reason. In doing so, he establishes much of the framework subsequent discussion in ethics adopts. This course closely addresses the development of Aristotle's project in the EN by reading two of the work's ten books in Greek.",
    "course_description": "This course intends to introduce students to Aristotle's ethical project through a close reading of two books of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics in Greek, e.g. I and X. These two books, for example, present some of work's most influential discussions, including the 'function argument' of I.7, Aristotle's account of habituation, and the striking connections made between contemplation, virtue, and happiness. They also raise important questions about the work's unity and purpose.The course's structure is two-fold. (1.) Close attention will be paid to Aristotle's development of his widely celebrated and contested ethical concerns. Here the construction of the work's philosophical Greek, its distinctive conceptual vocabulary, and its method of argumentation will take centre-stage. In tandem with this, we will closely examine how Aristotle's approach to moral philosophy follows from his commitments in his metaphysical, psychology, and biological works. This is only natural as Aristotle is a peculiarly systematic philosopher who draws on connections between different aspects of his body of work. (2.) In conjunction with a broader consideration of the EN, this careful inquiry into its arguments and language will be supplemented by a look at how the EN has fundamentally shaped moral philosophy pursued in its wake. The ancient reception of the Ethics, and the developments of e.g. Thomism and modern 'virtue ethics', will all be considered in light of Aristotle's text. As such, sessions will be devoted to how the work's distinctive framework (i.e. how it ties habituation, the emotions, practical wisdom, virtue and happiness together) structures subsequent traditions of moral philosophy from antiquity to the present.",

The main focus will be on British history but this will be placed firmly in the context of the evolving history of the United Kingdom and the British Empire.",
    "course_description": "The course provides a wide-ranging introduction to the history of, and relations between, modern Britain, Ireland and the Empire over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Although the course is organised chronologically, various themes underpin it. These include the evolution of British politics and society, the development of the British state, the changing nature of the union (with particular emphasis on British-Irish relations), the expansion (and eventual loss) of an overseas British empire, and Britain as a warfare state (with particular emphasis on the two world wars). Students enrolled on the course will not only be introduced to some of the key events and debates in these fields, but will also be encouraged to reflect on the notion of modern British history as a series of interconnecting circles radiating out from Westminster to the wider United Kingdom and far beyond.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: racial prejudice, racial violence. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

Attention will be paid to the usefulness (or otherwise) of the concept of 'early modernity', and the extent to which it can be applied to the world beyond Europe.",
    "course_description": "The period between c. 1500 and c. 1800 was an age of discovery, in which adventurers, merchants and diplomats sailed farther than ever before, and the lives of peoples from disparate parts of the globe became meaningfully entangled for the first time in human history. Trade in new commodities allowed great fortunes to be made by some, while others found themselves subjugated by the emergence of new imperial powers. Established relationships between church, state and the self were contested, and social and technological developments allowed for the dissemination of the written word beyond a privileged elite for the first time. A vibrant and noisy urban culture - and the emergence of women into the public sphere - brought with it new opportunities and new anxieties for the people of the early modern world. This course introduces students to key themes and debates in early modern history (c. 1500-1800), using selected case studies from around the world.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: violence and discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, age, nationality, sexuality, physical appearance, disability, socioeconomic status, politics, religion, and immigration. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "course_description": "The course explores the global history of three themes - goods, peoples and ideas. We interrogate the new forms of power which sought to reshape global connections in the period from c. 1450 and explore the ways in which polities and societies in Asia, Africa and Latin America engaged with and resisted the rise of European power and produced alternative imagined geographies, leading to the creation both of new connections and new forms of disconnection. This enables us to engage critically with linear narratives of globalization. At the same time, the course also provides an opportunity to reflect critically on the writing of global history and to consider how we best make sense of the intersections of the local and the global in this period.Goods(three themes from the following indicative list of topics, depending on staff availability in any given year):1.\tFrom the Silk Road to the New World2.\tTrading Companies3.\tSpices4.\tGold, Silver, and Diamonds5.\tCeramics6.\tCoffee and Tea7.\tTobacco and Potatoes8.\tOpium9.\tSugar10.\tArms and weapons11.\tLoot12.\tArt13.\tRubber and Oil14.\tSilk, Cotton and Jute15.\tCarsPeople:(three themes from the following indicative list of topics, depending on staff availability in any given year):1.\tThe Indian Ocean world2.\tThe Atlantic world3.\tSlave trade4.\tIndentured labour5.\tGerms and DNA: disease in global history6.\tRefugees in History7.\tPilgrimage8.\tRevolutionaries9.\tMissionaries10.\tSoldiersIdeas:(three themes from the following indicative list of topics, depending on staff availability in any given year):1.\tTime2.\tReligion: Christianity-global religion, local practice?3.\tReligion: Buddhism and Islam in Asia4.\tReligion: Neo-Confucianism, Neo-Buddhism, and Pentecostalism5.\tSecularism and Atheism6.\tLaw and legality7.\tOrientalism8.\tRacial thought9.\tFeminism/Gender10.\tParadigms of health and healing11.\tPolitical ideologies12.\tPan-Asianism/Pan-Africanism13.\tTechnology14.\tRailways and CanalsContent note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

The region is as diverse, culturally and geographically, as it is large: landscapes range from beaches to snow-capped mountains, and from deserts to rainforest, sometimes all within the borders of a single country. And the social landscape is equally pronounced, with dense urban cities like SÃ£o Paulo, Mexico City, and Port-au-Prince complementing a vast array of smaller towns and rural settings.As an introduction to the kaleidoscope of histories, cultures, and communities within Latin America and the Caribbean, this course will highlight some of the key developments of the region from the pre-1500 period (prior to European colonisation) all the way through the modern day. Themes of study will include indigenous history and systems of knowledge, the histories of enslavement and resistance, borders and the development of nation-states, geopolitics, and human rights. Throughout the course, an emphasis will be placed on analysing translations of primary and secondary sources to enable students to better understand the contributions made by writers and artists within the region to world history, politics, and culture.",

    "summary": "The course traces the interlocked story of the various polities that occupied late medieval Britain and Ireland. It examines the way in which the understanding of Britain as a cohesive geographical, political and cultural unit strengthened in the 12th and 13th centuries, and how this process reversed in the 14th century, an age of war, plague and economic decline.",
    "course_description": "The course provides students with an overview of the key developments in the history of late medieval Britain and Ireland. The course addresses and questions the comparative methodological approach pioneered by Rees Davies and Robin Frame (the so-called 'New British History') that seeks to understand the history of the British Isles as something more than a collection of 'national' political narratives. The chronological starting point is provided by the profound transformation of the aristocratic, ecclesiastical, administrative, economic structures, and cultural and social life, of the various polities within the British Isles that came in the wake of the Norman Conquest of Anglo-Saxon England. The course traces the way in which, thereafter, Frankish political and cultural norms extended over much of the British Isles and Ireland, drawing the various societies that inhabited the islands into European networks, largely mediated through the English crown and its associated institutions. The course outlines the way in which the 'Europeanisation' process allowed the English monarchy to reinforce its dominant position within Britain, before the impact of war, plague and famine in the fourteenth century destroyed the coherence of this 'English Empire'.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: violence and warfare, conquest and invasion, famine and plague, xenophobia. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

This course introduces students to the dynamic, intertwined histories of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries.

This course looks beyond 'national' political narratives to examine some of the major developments taking place not only in governmental and military affairs, but also in the church, in urban environments, in the writing of history and in everyday life. It traces how a French-speaking aristocracy extended their influence in the wake of the Norman Conquest of England, explores the process of 'Europeanisation' that allowed the English monarchy to reinforce its dominant position across the archipelago, and considers the impact of war, plague, famine and revolt in the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries that destroyed the coherence of this 'English Empire'.",

The course follows the development of the increasingly global connections which opened up during the medieval period.

After examining Rome and its legacy, the course follows Europeans eastwards across the Mediterranean and beyond in their search of new opportunities.

    "course_description": "The History of Edinburgh: From Din Eidyn to Festival City is designed to introduce students not registered for History degree programmes to the history of the city in which they are studying. The lecture series will highlight both the way in which the built environment and physical layout of the city has been shaped by historical processes, and how extant buildings, monuments and objects can be used to illuminate the concerns and ambitions of those societies that have occupied the area from the early-medieval period onwards. Tutorials will focus on the analysis of primary sources, textual and visual, that will foster student understanding of the way in which the city has developed through time. At the end of the course students will have an enhanced understanding of the cultural, political, social and institutional history of the city and the university.1.\tBeginnings: early history and landscape2.\tCastle and cross: the burgh founded3.\tScotland's capital city4.\tLiving in early modern Edinburgh5.\tTown and gown: popular politics and the university6.\tEnlightenment Edinburgh7.\tPolitical life in 18th and 19th century Edinburgh8.\tA tale of two cities: different Edinburghs9.\tThe Victorian city remodelled10.\tTwentieth century changes11.\tThe Festival CityContent note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

    "course_description": "This course offers a wide-ranging survey of European history from the late eighteenth century to the present. The course has a dual function. It provides a basic grounding in Modern European History as preparation for students intending to take Honours History courses. It also provides a stimulating and informative overview of the topic for students taking the course as an outside subject. This course contextualises 'modern Europe' by introducing students to a variety of critical historical frameworks and develops their understanding of major historical processes. Its prime purpose is to examine major themes that have shaped how Europe and European societies have evolved through the interplay of economic, social, political and cultural developments over a span of more than two hundred years. Such a wide chronological and geographical span means the course must be rigorously selective, and in consequence the lectures will use key events and case studies to illustrate the most significant themes and chronological developments. Some of these include colonialism, nationalism, imperialism, decolonisation, democracy, the French / 1848 / Russian Revolutions, the First and Second World Wars, the Cold War, and contemporary European history, politics and memory.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: war, colonisation, poverty, violence, racism, fascism, and the Holocaust.

It then examines the Anglo-Scottish union of 1707 and post-union Scotland, including such themes as Jacobitism, the Scottish Enlightenment and imperial expansion. The course encompasses nineteenth-century industrialisation, political reform and social change, before turning to the radical political and cultural upheavals of the twentieth century.It culminates in the present day, addressing such topics as gender, the arts and the debate about devolution and independence.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

This is just one example of how 'expert' knowledge has been at odds with grassroots and public knowledge, and there are many more. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, this course takes a deep dive into the ways different social groups and individuals have been able to control, access, develop and challenge scientific knowledge around sex, gender and sexuality throughout the twentieth century.

    "summary": "Historians can be guilty of ignoring or underestimating young people in the past, but this course centres the experiences of adolescents across medieval Europe, c.1000-c.1300. Religious, social, economic and political changes over these centuries impressed themselves with particular strength on young men and women. This module helps students to examine definitions and concepts of medieval adolescence and to assess the factors shaping young people's experiences, from gender, family and social status to work, religion and education.",
    "course_description": "The historical study of adolescence is a relatively new field. Since the 1960s, medievalists have challenged the claim that a concept of adolescence emerged only in the eighteenth century, often turning to insights from other disciplines to help overturn many previous assumptions. This course explores both ideas and realties of adolescence in Europe between c.1000 and c.1300. By engaging with historical concepts such as life cycle, gender, masculinity, and identity, students will hone transferable skills in summarising and contextualising complex ideas and arguments. The course also supports students to compare evidence from a diverse range of primary sources and develop their written and oral communication skills.The first half of the course considers different challenges the historian faces when studying adolescence, including problems of definition, gendered assumptions, and the prejudices of source material. Medieval writers overwhelmingly presented adolescence as masculine, but many young women experienced a similarly liminal phase between childhood and adulthood. The second half of the module turns to tailored case studies across different settings to evaluate whether, and how, experiences of adolescence differed. Wider developments across the period touched the lives of young men and women in the form of increasing legal and social regulation and changes to rites of passage. Expanding urban environments, schools and universities drew groups of youths into ever closer contact, and often conflict. Many young people faced similar expectations and pressures even if their paths to adulthood were different within specific monastic, courtly, knightly, educational and working environments. But did all young people experience this distinct life cycle phase? And was there anything universal about adolescent experience in medieval Europe?Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: sexual violence, rape, castration, suicide, eating disorders, antisemitism, child abuse, corporal punishment, bullying and physical harassment. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "course_description": "This course explores the interaction between humans, flora and fauna in the history of Africa. This is done in three distinct phases, (1) The pre-1800 period characterised by the origins of indigenous agriculture and contact with the Atlantic World, (2) The nineteenth and twentieth centuries when the African environment was under colonial domination, and (3) The post-independence period. In the first phase, the course examines the origins of indigenous agriculture, paying attention to the domestication of animals and plants. It further explores the spread of new crops to Africa. In the second phase, the course explores the environmental history of the continent during colonial rule, focusing on how the natural environment shaped relationships amongst the state, peasants and settler communities and how these interacted with nature. It explores various themes like animal diseases and the environment, wildlife policies and peasant reaction, forestry conservation, fisheries management, agriculture and soil conservation, and drought and famine ecologies. The last phase examines resource based conflicts and land reform and the environment in post-independent Africa.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: drought and famine ecologies, natural resources and resource-based conflicts.

Although conventionally considered as the dark ages in the history of the Greeks, the course will show that, in fact, this period was one of great intellectual vitality for the Greeks. We will recover this vitality by focusing on a wide area -- from the Black Sea and the Balkans to the eastern Mediterranean, and central Europe) -- and on figures such as Phanariot princes, Patriarchs (even executed ones), converts, ex-communicated radicals, courtiers in Russian service, and national poets who did not speak their native tongue.",
    "course_description": "This course focuses on one of the most underexplored periods in the history of the Greek world: that which followed the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople and up to the nineteenth century. In doing so, it explores how intellectual currents that were global in nature played out in this world and that of Eastern Christianity more generally. As we will see, the intellectual vitality of the Greek world was a result of its wide encounters with other cultures and traditions. We will explore these encounters by focusing on the thought and actions of a diverse group of figures, most of whom were multilingual, conversed with Islam, Protestantism and Catholicism, crossed cultures, and led mobile lives. We will also move our gaze in a wide area paying particular attention to the Greek communities under Venetian and Ottoman rule (in the Balkans, the Danube, the Ionian islands, Crete, the Italian peninsula), and later under Russian, Habsburg, British and French rule (in the Black Sea, but also in Vienna, and Paris).The course will make students aware of the multicultural realities and the intellectual encounters that characterised the Greek world, and offer them the analytical skills with which to understand them. It will also give them a firm grasp on the history of a region where cultures, religions, political communities, and Europe and the extra-European world met and interacted; a region that is currently at the heart of world-wide crises.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

    "summary": "This course explores key themes, events, and ideologies in twentieth-century US history through the lens of the American century's most beloved novel, To Kill a Mockingbird. Over the course of this special subject, students will consider the role of literature, film, and popular culture more generally, in the construction of the US's civil rights narrative.In particular, students will be encouraged to consider the successes and failures of white liberals, many of whom sought to influence and control both the progress and narrative of African American freedom. In Mockingbird's central character of Atticus Finch, white moderates found their hero, but the character's 'go slow' approach to civil rights is reflective of a broader strand of American white liberalism that stretched from the New Deal to the twenty-first century. This course therefore explores wider themes from the initial vantage point of one of the United States' most beloved cultural productions, examining both its influence and its representativeness in its assumption of an unquestioned white gaze and audience.",
    "course_description": "After some initial responses to To Kill a Mockingbird as novel and film, students will explore chronological events in US history and politics, with particular focus on the US South of the novel's setting. They will read articles and books from historians, literary scholars, cultural critics, and lawyers, many of whom have made direct connections between the book's setting during the Depression, its release in the 1960s, and its continued reverence amongst white Americans. This allows engagement with key events such as the New Deal, the Scottsboro trial, the civil rights movement, white backlash politics of the 1970s and 1980s, affirmative action, and the complicated legacy of southern white liberal presidents, notably Lyndon Johnson and Bill Clinton.Along the way, students will address key questions in twentieth-century US domestic history, from the central narrative of racial protest and progress, the vexed nature of liberal or moderate politics, and the relative successes and failures of the civil rights era. Atticus Finch's America therefore encourages students to complicate and question the continued longevity of the white moderate politics Harper Lee's hero reflected, as well as the reasons for its frequent rejection by African Americans, including high-profile snubs by James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison, Toni Morrison, and Ta-Nehisi Coates. It ultimately examines the continued reverence shown towards To Kill a Mockingbird as a cultural and literary icon, despite or perhaps because of the politics it reflected.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: racist language, racist violence (including lynching/murder), sexual violence (rape).

Students will draw on these learnings in the module's final assessment by pitching and defending an idea for a new museum exhibition or historical film/TV series of their own devising.",
    "course_description": "Public history, broadly defined, refers to representations of -- and engagement with -- the past that occur beyond the walls of academic history departments. In this expanded historical field, academic historians are only one of many stakeholders in the past, sharing their authority with heritage professionals, writers, artists, actors, directors, and members of the public. On this module, we explore what is at stake when the past is represented in public in museums and in historical film or television. We consider the challenges faced by museum professionals and filmmakers when representing the past to different audiences, and how technological advances might change the way we engage with the past. We enter into debates about the balance between historical accuracy and entertainment and how public history can both sustain and challenge dominant historical narratives. We analyse how public audiences engage with historical representations and the role of identities and emotions in this process. And we explore how academic historians are involved in public history representations as advisers, curators, critics, and audiences.This module has a significant practical and experiential dimension. As with any other module, we will be engaging conceptually with the historiographical literature on public history in our seminar discussions and assessment writings. But we will simultaneously pursue more hands-on experience with public history during independent learning time by visiting museum exhibitions locally and/or virtually and by watching historical films and TV series. This ethos is reflected in the module's final assessment, a written task that tests students' ability to both work theoretically with concepts/methods from public history research and to think practically and creatively about how to represent a particular past to a particular audience by pitching an idea for a museum exhibition or a historical film/TV series. The module may appeal particularly to students who are considering careers in heritage, media, local government, or the third sector; and to students attracted by assessment methods that differ from the standard academic essay.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics.

    "summary": "This course examines the relationship between humans and animals in the Middle Ages. The recent \"animal turn\" in the Humanities and Social Sciences has prompted a re-evaluation of assumptions about the relationship between humans and their ever present animal neighbours. The course will investigate key aspects of that relationship in the Medieval world, investigating and contrasting materials from a range of medieval societies, Christian, Muslim, Jewish and \"pagan\". How were animals and the natural world interpreted by medieval people? The course will examine various types of medieval sources, visual as well as textual in this exploration of the interface between humans and animals.",
    "course_description": "In recent years, a number of studies in the Humanities and Social Sciences have re-evaluated the assumptions that have informed understandings of the multi-faceted relationship between animals and human beings. This course makes use of the new approaches generated by this \"animal turn\" and applies them to an investigation of human-animal relationships in the Middle Ages. The course will examine a range of primary source materials, both textual and non-textual, relating to Christian, Muslim, Jewish and \"pagan\" societies. The chronological focus will be from Late Antiquity to c. 1300, although there will be references to ancient Greek and Roman texts.The course will cover themes including, but not necessarily restricted to: The \"animal turn\"; the medieval Bestiary; working and domesticated animals; thinking with animals; animals and religion; the commercial exploitation of animals and animal products; animals and medieval sport, spectacle, and entertainment; animal symbolism; animals and social status; animals and medieval social satire.Students will be taught through a series of seminars each of which will discuss one or more of the themes outlined above. The intended learning outcomes for the course include the expectation that students will attain a more informed understanding of the place of animals in medieval human societies.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: the mass killing of non-human species in the Middle Ages. The course discusses human uses of animal bodies and products and thereby confronts the evisceration of animals for sport, the eating of animal flesh and products, the skinning of animals and the wearing and other use of their furs and skins. Animal imagery was also used to other human beings, especially non Christians and other non Western ethnic groups. Some may find the discussion of the probability and implications of animal cognition and emotion disturbing. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

And when Humanity lands there, it looks out, and, seeing a better country, sets sail. Progress is the realisation of Utopias.\"- Oscar Wilde, The Soul of Man under Socialism, 1891Since antiquity, when Europeans have tried to advance new visions of society, or criticize old ones, they have often used utopias to dramatise their concerns. Utopias can be at once, literally, 'noplaces' or 'good-places'. We see them today in space operas, dystopian dramas, apocalyptic thrillers, political speeches, and even 'histories of the future'. This course addresses significant examples that once linked political dreams to contemporary anxieties, from the ancient Eastern Mediterranean to early modern England, giving equal weight to classical and early modern texts.Our mode of analysis will be historical, with a focus on social and intellectual contexts. Therefore, we will proceed by careful reading of the evidence, with a focus on a main primary source each week. Seminars will discuss each example in relation to its local political concerns while also exploring the formation of the genre more fully.This course is co-taught with Dr Benedikt Eckhardt in Classics.",

Too often the concept of human rights throughout the region exclusively invokes the image of maniacal military dictators abusing their own citizens, torturing and disappearing innocent people at will.

It pays attention to debates about the meaning of the concept of 'human rights', and it shows how those debates evolved in response to specific Latin American human rights crises. The course gives an overview of human-rights struggles throughout Latin American history, but mostly focuses on Cold-War dictatorships and civil wars of the 1960s to 1980s, looking at various country case-studies from the region. Finally, it explores the meanings of human rights in the contemporary landscape, asking what, if anything, the term still means in a neoliberal, transnationally linked 21st century.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

Men and women hotly debated the characteristics of a true artist, whether new inventions like telescopes should be trusted, or whether women can think as well as men - such book battles revealed a politics of knowledge that reached from courts to coffee-houses, from print-houses to salons.

It considers the role of the Atlantic and Indian Ocean slave trades in the emergence of globally-connected port cities, the creation of frontiers of enslavement and flight within Africa, and the interface between extractive states and stateless societies. From there it proceeds to an examination of the dynamics and consequences associated with the partition of Africa and the efforts of colonial states to define borders and control the flows of people, goods and diseases. Particular attention will be paid to countervailing efforts to evade and subvert colonial border controls and to the vibrancy of cross-border cultural life, especially in port and border cities.In the second semester, consideration will be given to the reasons why plans for continental unity and larger territorial federations stalled and why colonial borders were mostly retained at the point of independence. The attempted breakaway of Biafra from Nigeria will be serve as a case-study of the reasons why secessionist ideas gained traction and why they ultimately failed as political projects. The course will also explore the reasons why other kinds of insurgencies have tended to incubate in borderlands. The course will also pay particular attention to the lived social and economic life of borderlands, with a focus on peripheral urbanism, trade/smuggling and patterns of forced and voluntary migration in the contemporary period.The course will turn largely on academic debates arranged around the core themes.

    "summary": "This course offers a detailed immersion in British politics and government during the Second World War. It covers a range of issues - diplomacy, war, party politics, the Churchill coalition, leadership, economic organisation and the boundaries of the British state.",
    "course_description": "This course is a detailed examination of politics and government in Britain during the Second World War. This period arguably witnessed the birth of modern Britain, as the state was remodelled and the social contract rewritten under the pressures of total war and coalition politics. It has also given us many of our enduring myths: the alleged cowardice of appeasement, the heroic leadership of Winston Churchill, and a 'swing to the left' in public opinion. Students taking the course will be challenged to question these myths. A significant number of the leading figures of modern British political history (besides Churchill, men like Neville Chamberlain, Lord Halifax, Clement Attlee, Ernest Bevin, Herbert Morrison, Anthony Eden, and Stafford Cripps) were prominent in government during this period. They shared the public stage with non-political experts, such as John Maynard Keynes, William Beveridge, and Harold Laski. And the interwar ascendancy of the Conservative party was eroded, culminating in a landslide win for the Labour party in the July 1945 general election. Taken together, this represented a watershed in the history of the British state, party politics, and the relationship between government and citizen. The course asks students to consider the duties of government under conditions of national emergency; the nature of cross-party coalitions; the role of leadership in politics; and unpack the ideological changes of this period.Content note: This course will expose students to a considerable variety of approaches in the field of political history. Students taking the course need to be prepared to engage with historical actors on their own terms and grapple with ideas and movements with which they may personally disagree. Engaging with a diverse range of viewpoints is integral to the study of History at a university. Seminars on the course often range widely, and discussion will proceed in a free and spontaneous fashion.",

    "course_description": "Wars are occasions when ideas about national identity become highly visible and questions of inclusion and belonging particularly acute. Societal understandings of gender roles are also foregrounded. This course takes a detailed and critical look at the interplay between national, ethnic, class and gender identities at times of conflict, adopting a four-nation approach.  It explores the formation of identities in Britain and Ireland during the two world wars and the relationship between the two nations. It highlights the centrality of gender to the analysis of wartime experience in twentieth century Britain and explores how gender identities are socially, culturally and historically shaped. It examines the public construction of gender roles in wartime and considers the ways in which norms of masculinity and femininity were promoted and utilised by the government to mobilise the British population at war.  Particular attention is paid to the connections between the construction of national identities and the memorialisation of conflict: the ways in which the First and Second World Wars have been narrated, remembered and commemorated.  Using primary sources including archived oral testimonies, news reels, art, literature, life-writing, photographs, documentary and fictional films, the course will encourage students to enhance their written and oral communication skills through group presentations and to improve their knowledge of interpreting primary source materials.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: racial violence and hostility, sexual violence, discriminatory attitudes, wartime prejudice.

In this course we will explore Carnival in historical context and across multiple sites in the Atlantic world, from colonial Trinidad in the 1880s to London in the 1970s.

Through an exploration of Carnival in late nineteenth-century Port-of-Spain (Trinidad), Salvador (Brazil) and Rio (Brazil) we will consider how the formerly enslaved entered and shaped Carnival, through satirical masquerade, dance and music, even from their subaltern position. We will then move to New Orleans Mardi Gras to consider a very different case study, in which Carnival became a site of 'violent ridicule' from which to articulate and perform white supremacy in the city (Roach, 1996). We will examine attempts to 'clean-up Carnival' under bourgeois stewardship in Trinidad on the cusp of independence from the British Empire. We will examine the Caribbean influence on 1930s Harlem, and later Brooklyn with the transplantation of Caribbean Carnival to New York City. Finally, we will examine the formation of Caribbean Carnival in post-war (post-)imperial London, first at St Pancras and later at Notting Hill.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

In this course, we will examine cartography as a lens for analyzing modern ideas of territory and sovereignty, particularly by state officials and indigenous peoples. Maps help us to understand how territories are claimed, how nations and nationalisms are formed, and how measuring and representing geographic space influences encounters between different cultures. Maps enable us to understand conflicting political ideals and tense relationships between competing sovereignties and territories of indigenous peoples and nation-states.In the first half of this course, we will examine the role of cartography in the construction of conflicting territories, sovereignties, and identities across the modern world.

    "summary": "This course examines the printed images that were produced in London during the long eighteenth century. It analyses what this engaging form of source material reveals about social attitudes, political ideas, and cultural life in Georgian England. Satirical, didactic and decorative prints are studied in exploring what was a 'golden age' of graphic design and a formative period in the making of 'public opinion' in Britain.",
    "course_description": "This honours course explores a variety of the printed images that were produced in England between 1700 and 1830. This was a 'golden age' in the history of English art in general and of graphic satire in particular. Some 20,000 examples of single-sheet images were published in London between 1760 and 1820 alone. Many concern political themes and feature the individuals, events, and scandals that dominated British national life. Others provide social commentary, exposing the follies, foibles and fashions of all manner of people. Still others offer information, instruction, and decoration. Taken together they amount to a huge and rich corpus of material that reveals much about the issues, sentiments and prejudices that characterised eighteenth-century public opinion and popular culture.The course will develop skills of identifying the major artists, engravers and publishers who created and disseminated these images. It will help students to recognise the various techniques involved in their production, including engraving, etching, and mezzotint. Themes to be explored will include the circumstances that lay behind the making of graphic art, the audiences at which it was aimed, and the impact that it had. These classes will seek to interpret the intricate symbolism and coded messages that this material often contained, and investigate the contemporary social, political and cultural contexts that help to explain its meanings.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

Through studying the relations the Franks had with the peoples living around them in the decades around the year 800, the course shifts the focus away from the imperial centre towards its borders. By contextualising Charlemagne's empire in this way, we shall develop a clearer understanding of what Europe (Europa) meant in the ninth century.The course will begin with a succinct summary of Carolingian Francia at the time of Charlemagne, before moving onto a panorama of the peoples who were in contact with the Franks, from the Irish to Byzantium, and from al-Andalus to the Danes. We shall then take a thematic turn, considering the mechanisms and conceptualisations that informed these relations, before concluding with a reconsideration of what it meant when a contemporary hailed Charlemagne as 'Father of Europe'. At the heart of the course is your own individual analysis of the sources, enriched through collaboration with your peers in the seminars, a group project and a course symposium, as well as through your own reflections on your learning.

    "summary": "Arguably no other country in the world during the twentieth century experienced such dramatic and turbulent change as China. At the turn of the century China was ruled by the Qing dynasty, heir to an imperial tradition that can be traced back to the 3rd century BC. By the end of the century China had experienced three major political revolutions (as well as enormous social and cultural change) and is today one of the very few states in the world still ruled by a Communist party. This course aims to provide insight into the meaning and significance of these changes.",
    "course_description": "This course will focus on the nature and impact of five major developments in twentieth-century Chinese history: (1) The 1911 Revolution, which overthrew China's last imperial dynasty and established a republic, the first in Asia; (2) the Nationalist Revolution of the 1920s and the establishment of China's first party-state under the Guomindang (Nationalist Party); (3) the Communist-led rural revolution of the 1930s and 1940s that ushered in the People's Republic of China in 1949; (4) Mao Zedong's 'Cultural Revolution', which shook the Chinese socialist state in its foundations; and (5) the revolution that never was -- Tian'anmen and the politics of China in the 1980s.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: mass violence, violence in the context of warfare, including sexual violence and violence against civilians. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "summary": "During the Second World War, the Republic of China was one of the major belligerents, and a key ally of the Western power and the USSR. And yet, the Chinese part in WW2 has not been reflected in the historiography and memory of this conflict outside China; this is a result of Cold War politics, and of the Chinese socialist revolution of 1949. This course uses newly translated primary sources and a recent body of scholarship to explore the role of the \"forgotten ally\" (Rana Mitter) during the war, and the importance of the war for  reshaping modern East Asia.",
    "course_description": "This course considers the political, military, and diplomatic dimensions of China's participation in international conflict in East Asia from the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 until the end of the Korean War in 1953. At the beginning of this period, China was governed by the recently established Nationalist regime of Chiang Kai-shek. By 1953, the recently established Communist government of Mao Zedong had firmly committed itself to the Soviet camp through its participation in the Korean War. China, in the space of just over twenty years, had come all the way from being a Nationalist regime struggling against the vestiges of imperialism to becoming a core ally of the USSR during the early Cold War.Clearly, participation in this series of conflicts was transformative for the successive regimes in control of the Chinese mainland. And yet, China's experience of the Second World War was underexplored until recently. The Communist regime on the mainland preferred to ignore the Nationalist wartime effort in fighting the Japanese, as did the Nationalists' former allies once they had switched diplomatic recognition to the PRC. In recent years, both academic engagement with and public memories of the wartime period have become more diverse, which has resulted in a flourishing of scholarship both within and outwith the PRC. This therefore seems like a good time in history to explore the wartime experience of the Second World War's fifth major allied power, and the effects of that experience on the development of post-war East Asia, which are relevant until the present day.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: violence in the context of war, including sexual violence, violence against civilians, and battlefield violence.

By the end of the course, students should be able to place the West's current fascination with China within a historical context of which Marco Polo, Lord Anson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Fu Manchu, Franz Kafka and David Bowie are all a part.Content Warning: In this course we examine and critique anti-Chinese attitudes, stereotypes and language that some students may find upsetting.",

This course explores the economic and social transformation that accompanied this apparent rupture, and its consequences for the world we live in.",
    "course_description": "This course explores one the most transformative events of the twentieth century as national, personal, and global history. Before focusing in of the drama of 1991, we will move back in time to explore the roots of the Soviet collapse during late socialism. We will review the USSR's ambitions to create an alternative future for the world and its inhabitants, as well as what had been made. We will deepen our understanding of where the USSR, its leaders and people found themselves in the 1970s, which historians are identifying as a pivotal decade worldwide. We will explore three classic explanations for the superpower collapse and their roots in late socialism -- economic impossibility, a revolution of truth-telling, and national self-determination -- adding to them a consideration of the global economic and political context.Moving forward, we examine the ways everyday life changed in the 1990s as consequence of the loss of Soviet identity as well as the Soviet state and economy. Throughout, we will consider the varied experiences of social and economic upheaval for women, men, ethnic minorities, resident foreigners, and other social groups. We will assess the effects of new and old dreams, and the loss of them. We will consider the implications of the metaphors and narratives we employ, such as \"collapse,\" \"fall,\" \"transition,\" \"crisis,\" and \"revolution\", and ask how the process of writing histories of recent events may differ from those in the deeper past. At the end of the course, we will turn towards the memories and legacies of Soviet life, and of the disintegration of the world's second superpower, continue to flicker, stabilize, and explode as post-Soviet generations build new lives, including in times of war.Course note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

It suggests re-assessments of the history of violence in the 20th century and looks at different forms of self-appointed European missions in the non-European world. The Christian, scientific, civilizing and modernizing missions were different formats through which Europeans aimed to legitimize colonial rule and the their politics of difference. Particular interest will be paid to the increasing contradictions between the self-conception of European democracies and the realities of colonial warfare on the other hand. Last not least, the module will pay attention to recent debates on the colonial character of the Nazi Empire, questions of how racism and violence in the colonies were linked to experiences on the European continent. Colonialism did not vanish in the air. Legacies, traditions and repercussions will be broadly discussed. The module will end by looking at the broader debate on repercussions of colonial experiences by looking at recent attempts of Western armies in Iraq and Afghanistan to learn from colonial wars.",

Gender, class, literacy, consumption and material culture are principal concerns throughout the course. Participants will be encouraged to make use of a range of primary sources - textual, visual, material - that take us beyond the standard political narratives, and help us to understand the complex social and cultural lives of a range of Chinese men and women during this fascinating period.Note: This course does not assume any knowledge of the languages of China.",

    "course_description": "Since the Second World War, culture and the arts have occupied increasingly visible and important roles in Scottish society. The introduction of state funding for the arts through the Arts Council of Great Britain, increased leisure time arising from a range of wider social and economic changes, and effects of the upheavals and challenges of the 1960s resulted in culture becoming a significant part of local and Scottish-national government policy. During the same period, the arts became a crucial space in which to test out, express and challenge ideas about and representations of Scots and Scotland. This class explores culture and the arts in relation to changing practices of the arts and ideas about the role of culture in society, broader social change, and debates around Scottish national identity. The first part of the class explores key concepts, themes and developments in culture and the arts in the period c. 1945-1997, including the creation and development of cultural policy, the challenges and upheavals of the 1960s, and the growing use of culture in urban regeneration and city branding. The second part of the class applies these understandings to examples of the arts in practice, with students having the opportunity to examine a range of dramatic performances, theatres, visual arts, films and television programmes, and arts festivals. By exploring these interactions between the arts and society, students will develop new perspectives on the history of post-war Scotland.",

In Inferno and Purgatorio, that is vividly brought to life by Dante's encounters with tragically flawed historical and mythological characters from across Europe and the Mediterranean, who undergo diverse punishments for their sins in highly visionary settings. This course explores those two realms of Dante's afterlife, which respectively deal with eternal damnation and redemptive penitence, together with the medieval world that inspired them, and their legacy and influence through the centuries.",
    "course_description": "While exploring in depth most of Dante's Divine Comedy, this course also offers an advanced analysis on the medieval world and its incredibly rich legacy. Of the three sections of the Divine Comedy, Inferno and Purgatorio have always been overwhelmingly favoured because of their dramatic gallery of complex, flawed, and colourful inhabitants, the far from clear-cut accounts about their lives and deaths, and their vivid settings and punishments. The structure of the course closely reflects those of Dante's Inferno and Purgatorio, which are explored in the first and second semester respectively: after an introductory session providing guidance and an overview of the Divine Comedy and its context, each seminar explores one of the sections of Inferno and Purgatorio, with their different categories of sinners. Each seminar will include the reading, discussion and contextualisation of the text of one of those thematic sections. The last seminar of each semester will explore the legacy of Dante's work. Indeed, while providing food for thought for themes that are still of key relevance today, the Divine Comedy has been described as a compendium of medieval learned and popular culture, and is also one of its most influential works because of the profound influence that it exerted over authors, thinkers and artists through the centuries.Content note: Being a course about damnation and Hell, every week touches upon potentially sensitive or difficult topics. Please read this summary of the content of Dante's Inferno: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante); with a more redemptive and cheerful outlook in Purgatory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy#Purgatorio",

This course focuses on the most famous and dramatic section of his Divine Comedy, that is, Dante's journey through the nightmarish nine circles of Hell. The Inferno explores the nature and effects of mortal sin and evil by portraying a gallery of tragically flawed characters along with the never-ending punishment to which they are subjected in terrifying settings and under the watch of devils and mythological monsters.",
    "course_description": "The Divine Comedy has been described as a compendium of medieval culture, but it is also one of its most long-term influential works. While death and ideas on afterlife were at the centre of life in the Middle Ages, Dante's Divine Comedy is not only the most complex and articulated narrative about the afterlife, the high learned and popular sides of the Christian community. At the same time, the Divine Comedy has been exerting a profound influence to this day over authors, thinkers and artists. Of the three sections of the Divine Comedy, that is, Inferno, Purgatory and Paradise, the first has always been overwhelmingly favoured since it is very dramatic and due to its gallery of complex, flawed and colourful inhabitants. Dante's journey through Hell amounts to an historical archive of evils ordered according to type and severity as reflected in their settings and punishments. Yet those evils are embodied by historical and mythological individuals and by the far from clear-cut stories which they recount about their deaths. The programme closely reflects the structure of Dante's Inferno: after an introductory session providing guidance and outlining Dante's biography, each seminar explores one of nine circles of Hell (which in turn represent different categories of sinners and the gradual increase of their wickedness), focusing on the reading, discussion and contextualisation of one or more of their cantos, while the last seminar explores the legacy of the work by focusing on the English speaking world.o\tIntroduction: Dante's life and how to read the Divine Comedyo\tThe threshold of Hell and the 1st circle (Limbo): the uncommitted on the banks of the River Acheron, the unbaptised and the castle of the virtuous paganso\t2nd circle, Lust: the winds of lust and the tragedy of Paolo and Francescao\t3rd circle, Gluttony: the watch of the 'Great Worm' Cerberus and the slush of the gluttonso\t4th circle, Greed: the watch of Plutus, the joust of the stone-bearing damned, and the role of fortuneo\t5th circle, Anger: the fight of the wrathful on the surface of the Stygian Marsho\t6th circle, Heresy: the flaming tombs of heretics and unbelieverso\t7th circle, Violence: the watch of the Minotaur and its three ringso\t8th circle, Fraud: the cliff of the winged monster Geryono\t9th circle, Treachery: the watch of the giants and Satan's icy prisono\tThe legacy of Dante's inferno",

    "summary": "This course is intended as an in-depth analysis of the 'postwar moment' in Europe, from the dying embers of the Second World War to the global economic transformation of the 1970s. The aim will be to examine the ways in which Europeans came to terms with the traumas of war and sought to rebuild a shattered continent. Students will explore the period through close-grained historical reading in seminars and a series of source workshops, in which they will discuss literary, film, artistic and documentary sources.",
    "course_description": "The main focus will be on four countries - France, Germany, Italy and Czechoslovakia - and the range of primary sources will be deliberately eclectic. In addition to oral sources and other archival documents, students can expect to read texts by writers such as Milan Kundera, Wolfgang Koeppen, Frantz Fanon, Simone de Beauvoir, Milan Kundera, Herbet Marcuse, Primo Levi and Albert Camus, and watch films by directors such as Gillo Pontecorvo and Federico Fellini. The secondary reading will be equally varied and students will be encouraged to work with historical, sociological, literary and anthropological writings. These should allow students to think imaginatively about the origins and meaning of social change in twentieth-century Europe.Content note: The study of history inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: racism, colonial violence, anti-semitism, sexual violence, genocide, dehumanisation in wartime, traumatic memories of war, and representations of nuclear war. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

Key themes include gender and the body; renunciation of sexuality; sexual politics in courts and harems; the relevance of sexuality to ethnic, religious and social identities; homosexualities and heteronormativity; the relevance (or not) of the premodern past to modern questions.The course begins in the later Roman world before turning to a range of post-Roman societies in western Europe and comparative material on distinctive configurations of sexuality, gender, power and religion in other societies, including Islamic caliphates and Byzantium.Students should note that more than one seminar will address rape, sexual abuse and violence",

Special attention is paid to the advocates of humanitarian relief and progressive institutional reform, and to the language of 'emancipation' and 'moral reform', in both the settler colonies and a range of 'dependant' colonies. Students will have an opportunity to study a succession of major imperial reforms, from the abolition of slavery throughout the empire to the establishment of 'responsible government' in the Canadian colonies.",
    "course_description": "This course explores the imperial dimensions of Great Britain's 'age of reform'. The two decades between the passing of the Roman Catholic Relief Act (1829) and the collapse of Chartism were a crucible for the modernization of British institutions. Progressive legislation reformed municipal government, the state churches, the provision of poor relief and even Parliament itself. Yet, the spirit of reform did not terminate at the metropolitan borders. Rather, it permeated the entire empire and made lasting changes to the way in which the empire operated. During these decades, West Indian and South African colonies were profoundly impacted by the abolition of slavery; the South Asian territories under East India Company sovereignty became subject to a raft of Anglicizing legislative reforms; and the settler colonies of Upper Canada, New South Wales and New Zealand negotiated new constitutional settlements. By considering each of these reforms, among others, this course interrogates the relationship of the British metropole to its imperial periphery. There will also be a strong focus on the language of 'emancipation', the drive for 'moral reform' and the influence of evangelical culture at home and abroad.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics.

The course asks students to consider the relationship between ideologies and modern politics; the problem of turning doctrines into tangible policies; the importance of personality, ambition, and rivalry in public life; and debate the role of leadership in determining political outcomes. Internal party politics and Labours relationship with the wider polity and society will be equally central to the course. Students should seek to develop their own sense of the dynamics of modern British politics.Content note: This course will expose students to a considerable variety of approaches in the field of political history.

    "course_description": "This course charts the arc of political and constitutional change between Catholic emancipation and the full enfranchisement of women a century later. Although Britain's route to participatory democracy was comparatively smooth and peaceful (indeed, Britain was unique among its European peers in being untouched by revolution during this century), progressive reform was never inevitable. This course consequently emphasizes the contingent nature of this process. British democracy was never pre-ordained, despite the claims of Victorian liberals who described successive reforms as evidence of inevitable 'progress'. Nor was the Westminster Parliament in the vanguard of democracy during this period. In 1914 Britain was governed by one of the least representative parliaments in the developed world. This course consequently emphasizes the staying power of the ancien regime in the face of reform. During this period, parliamentary and other reforms were very often initiated by the political establishment itself with the intention of shoring up old systems rather than of bringing new ones into existence. This mentality, which has been described as 'reforming to conserve', will be a key focus of this course.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

    "course_description": "This course enquires into the role played by the ideology and leadership of Mahatma Gandhi in India's struggle for independence. In addition the neglected but equally important part played by social, revolutionary and peasant-based movements in this period will be examined. The course will focus attention on an important period in modern Indian history and by its structure will highlight new perspectives in historical writing on India which have been a source of considerable debate of late. In particular the validity of 'official' accounts of recent Indian history - whether written from a nationalist or a colonialist perspective - has been contested in what is now developing into a voluminous re-interpretative literature. This course will therefore survey the conventional historiography concerning the influence of British constitutional initiatives, caste associations, political factions and prominent national leaders - particularly Mahatma Gandhi - in the independence movement. At the same time it will examine a range of new writing on Indian history which analyses the disparate, unorganised and sometimes violent, 'grassroots', and popular movements which played an equally important role in undermining colonial rule.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: this course includes topics relating to sexual, caste and communal violence. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "course_description": "This course examines the history of Scotland's early inroads into the Atlantic. While Scotland's role in the British Empire has been widely acknowledged, it is less well-known that prior to 1707, Scotland made sustained attempts at becoming an Atlantic player. Gazing West introduces students to the various attempts at establishing trading companies and colonies in competition with and emulation of other, successful Atlantic powers such as England, France and the Dutch Republic, and asks why Scotland failed where others succeeded. This is the 'pre-history' of what, on occasion, has been called Scotland's Empire. It is important as it provides insights into why Scotland could become so important so quickly in the British Empire of the eighteenth and nineteenth century. The course covers both the chronology and the historiography of Scotland's Atlantic history and makes extensive use of primary material.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

    "summary": "We all experience work as gendered beings, in a world structured by racial capitalism and the legacy of imperialism. Yet the mainstream historical narratives of economy and labour still resist a serious engagement with gender. This course will provide you with alternative (feminist) conceptual frameworks within which to study the past and present issues of labour, production, value, cultures of work, inequality, and skill.",
    "course_description": "This course provides students with a comparative global history of feminist approaches to work, broadly defined, from 1750 to WWII. It starts from the premise that mainstream economic history has consistently failed to integrate gender into its conceptual frameworks and relied on male-centric, narrow definitions of value and skill. This year-long course presents an alternative paradigm that a) expands the concept of \"work\" to incorporate all activities that generate use value, thus problematising the productive/reproductive work binary, and b) de-centres Europe as \"the\" location of capitalist work relations by drawing on cases from a wide range of historical contexts.The course starts with an exploration of recent trends in global histories of work, and feminist critiques of the fundamentals of economic thought. It continues with a sector-by-sector, in-depth analysis of the ways in which new forms of work emerged and were assigned value within capitalist economies, and of the ideological and cultural assumptions that shaped these processes. In encompassing nearly two hundred years that played a crucial role in shaping modern relations of production, as well as a vast geography stretching from Peru to China, the course provides students with the means to interrogate the historical origins of the division and hierarchies of labour in key sectors of contemporary capitalist economies.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: violence and discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, age, nationality, sexuality, physical appearance, disability, socioeconomic status, politics, religion, and immigration.

They will interrogate the utility and problems of the very concept itself. They will also study responses to genocide in the form of 'humanitarian intervention' and war crimes trials. The cases will be drawn from across the world: Asia, Africa, Europe, the Americas and Australasia, with perpetrators ranging from imperialist powers to fascists, communists, nation-state builders, 'developmentalists' and counter-insurgency fighters, and 'enablers' ranging from structural features of the international political economy to regional and world powers and the contours of the Cold War.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

    "summary": "Discover a Global Middle Ages that stretched from China to Morocco, from the Mediterranean across the Indian Ocean to the Pacific, the world of the Silk Roads. Between 900 and 1400 merchants span commercial webs along which travelled people, commodities and ideas, socially and culturally as well as politically and economically integrating the \"Old World\" more closely than ever before: Indonesians settled in Madagascar, Mongol Khans ruled the largest land empire in history, and pandemic ravaged three continents. So is this an example of \"globalisation\" before European dominated modernity, and how does the world of the Silk Roads relate to ours today?",
    "course_description": "In popular imagination the Middle Ages are inherently European. Seen from a global perspective, however, Europe in 900 sat on the margins of a world that was centred in the Middle East and China, and spanned by interconnecting commercial webs across Asia and the Indian Ocean - the world of the Silk Roads. The next five centuries saw unprecedented social, political and economic integration between the continents of the \"Old World\", with rapid urbanisation from the Atlantic to the Pacific, huge movements of people, commodities and ideas, and the largest land empire in history. By the mid fourteenth century, however, this world entered a profound crisis of economic collapse and deadly pandemic. From the ashes a new, \"modern\" world would emerge, increasingly dominated by European states.This Special Subject explores the world of the Silk Roads, and the revolutionary rise of commercial capitalism that created them. Students will tour Afro-Eurasia's regions, and read travel accounts, letters, geographies, inscriptions and histories translated from languages including Arabic, Armenian, Chinese, Greek, Latin and Persian. We'll pose big questions about pre-modern politics and economics, the role of climate in history, the invention of race, gender dynamics and more, and engage with postcolonial perspectives, World Systems Analysis, and contemporary medieval \"theory\" in Ibn Khaldun's Muqaddimah, to help us answer them. Ultimately we'll ask whether the world of the Silk Roads represents a period of globalisation before European dominated modernity, and how this relates to our rapidly changing world today.",

    "course_description": "The NHS is a major part of many people's lives. It's the UK's largest single employer, we're all likely to engage with its services at some point in our lives; it's a huge political talking point; and it plays a big role in British national identity. And yet, you might not have spent much time considering its history. This course will not only provide you with a general understanding of the NHS's political history, but also acquaint you with its complex social dynamics, its cultural representations, and the fraught emotions it has evoked over its 75-year-history.Together we'll read a mix of scholarly essays and books; we'll watch films clips and TV episodes; and explore primary sources like newspaper articles, political manifestos, diaries, letters, and novels. While you will leave this course with a solid grasp of the history of NHS policy and how the service functions, this is primarily a course about the social, cultural, and emotional past. We'll consider themes of gender, race, chronic disease and disability, as well as social class, and reflect on who has been excluded from the NHS, both historically and today. As a result, you'll not only come away with lots more knowledge about the history of modern Britain and its welfare state, but also a new understanding of the fraught, emotive, and politicised narratives that circulate about the NHS. We will think about how the history of the health service has shaped the present, and consider how the past has been instrumentalised in service of certain aims, and political and professional identities.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: sexism, homophobia, racism, racial violence, death, disease, deprivation, childbirth, miscarriage, suicide, and Covid 19.

But it is also a nation that saw the largest importation of African slaves, a series of repressive military regimes, and has recently suffered from a dramatic spike in urban violence, deforestation, political corruption, and a volatile economy. The purpose of this course is to help students understand that although neither of those two images of Brazil is completely accurate, they are not totally false either. We will trace the changes and continuities in Brazilian history from the colonial period to the present day in order to show how various relationships of power have produced a society that can simultaneously embody such a wide range of elements.",

We will trace the changes and continuities in Brazilian history from the colonial period to the present day and examine how social and political legacies from the colonial period affected Brazil's emergence as a modern nation-state. Brazil was the largest recipient of enslaved Africans during the Atlantic slave trade, and we will pay special attention to the country's history of slavery, slave emancipation, and race relations.Content note: The study of history inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

Each week through studying a particular plant, animal or mineral (with a few exceptions) we will consider how these interactions with nature shape our political worlds in the Anthropocene. Over the course of the semester we will ask questions such as, what is the relationship between capitalism and nature? How can commodity histories inform larger histories of social change? How have political events fueled, disrupted and reconstituted certain kinds of global relationships with natural resources?

    "summary": "Everyday life is saturated by the past. Memories -- both personal and \"collective\" -- structure how people view themselves and the world around them, their daily behaviours and attitudes, and how they interact with others. Moreover, these memories are forged, made meaningful, and reworked through everyday activities, be it chatting with friends and family, reading the newspaper, browsing social media, watching TV, walking the streets, eating food, or playing games. This course explores the relationship between history, memory, and everyday life. It seeks to uncover the power and the possibilities of memory in shaping everyone's unfolding present -- and how studying these everyday practices of remembrance leads to a fuller understanding of history and the place of the individual within it.",
    "course_description": "This module explores how the past is remembered in both formal acts of commemoration and the more informal settings of everyday life. The course is divided into two distinctive but related halves. In the first semester, we adopt a more bird's eye and representational perspective, exploring key concepts from the canon of Memory Studies through the analysis of formal representations of the past such as those found in museums, monuments, statues, historical film, or TV documentary history. This gives us a critical grounding in issues such as the relationship between individual and collective memory, the use and abuse of the past in the service of the nation, the transmission of memories from one generation to the next, and the travels of memory across national and cultural boundaries through media, migration, and digital technology.In semester two, we pursue a more bottom-up approach. We ask not only how people engage with more formal historical representations, but also how memories of the past suffuse activities and places that are not self-consciously commemorative and how they impact upon the lives of people who do not have a self-professed interest in history. This endeavour will take us from the quiet abandoned industry of Detroit to the noisy and often vitriolic space of YouTube, from selfies at Auschwitz to the board game Secret Hitler, and from the taste of feta cheese to Viking-inspired craft beer. This course will be particularly suitable to students with an interest in memory, public history, and social history \"from below\".Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: genocide, colonialism, discrimination, war, death, and violence. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "course_description": "This course examines the way Scotland was transformed in the period from the Stuart Restoration until the first quarter of the eighteenth century, not least as a result of its relations abroad. The self-conscious ways in which politicians, intellectuals and professionals expressed their concern with Scotland and its place in the world, both in relation to England, Europe and the emerging Atlantic empires, sets this period apart from the sixteenth and earlier seventeenth centuries, and arguably led to a pre-occupation with improvement. The course examines the interplay between challenges at home and the impact of the country's exchanges in people, goods and ideas, especially with the Continent. Amongst others, it looks at the language and intellectual underpinnings of such various projects of improvement as the quest for a Scottish colony, the reform of the universities, the development of the legal and medical professions and the Union debate.The course aims to:- develop an in-depth knowledge and an advanced, critical understanding of processes of modernisation and change in Scotland between c. 1660 and c. 1730;- deepen students' knowledge and understanding of early modern Scottish history;- develop students' skills and confidence in interpreting primary texts;- develop students' analytical, critical and communication skills, in both written and verbal forms.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

We tackle these problems by framing them historically, with a comparative focus on modern India and Japan (including their relationship with the West) and via the theories and techniques of medical anthropology and philosophy of psychiatry. Our core primary source materials include: letters, novels, books, and autobiographies produced by pioneering Indian and Japanese psy professionals and thinkers, alongside clinical case reports, reports of fieldwork, published patient testimony, film, and other art forms.

The focus will be on the new revisionist interpretations of late Mughal India, and on the effects of subsequent developments on the lives of ordinary Indians, including the impact of the advent of colonial rule over two-thirds of the subcontinent. The second half of the course will engage with the religious, cultural and socio- economic changes of the late colonial period and emergence of Indian nationalism. It will conclude with an examination of the holocaust of India's Partition, which apart from its death doll of one million, saw the largest single mass migration in human history.The Indian subcontinent is approximately the same size and equally, if not more, diverse than Europe and host to one of the world's oldest civilisations. It has also played a crucial role in premodern and modern history and today encompasses one fifth of humanity. The emphasis of this course will be on India culture and politics of the early modern and colonial period, integrating these where appropriate with the study of changes in the society and political economy. All of these elements will be examined with the emphasis on indigenous perspectives, illustrated wherever possible with documents, films and writing from within the subcontinent, and in the light of recent research. The course stands on its own but also provides a useful background for those intending to proceed to study the 4MA History course on Gandhi and Popular Movements in India or other senior honours courses addressing the history of the non-Western and non-European world.",

Indigenous movements have also emerged precisely at a historical moment when more established movements based on class have declined throughout the hemisphere in the wake of the Cold War and state repression. This course traces these developments through the study of Native-state relations in postcolonial Guatemala. Over the course of this semester we will explore the conflicted meanings and practices of citizenship and nation in Guatemala and how the silencing of Maya histories of expropriation and exclusion, as well as ongoing struggles for restitution and recognition, have left colonial traces in even the seemingly most progressive national and revolutionary projects.",

    "course_description": "North America was not empty when European settlers arrived. But the history of indigenous Americans is not one of inevitable decline, it is not over -- and it is central to the story of the wider history of the U.S. This course explores over two centuries of indigenous American history from multiple perspectives, including episodes of violent conflict, cultural exchange, religious, technological, and political innovation, and resilience. We will discuss why the encounter of Europeans and Native Americans became so violent, as well as what settler colonialism and how it was integral to the formation of the United States and its rise to global power.Ranging from the syncretic religion of the Ghost Dance to the brutal massacres at Sand Creek and Wounded Knee, from a nascent Comanche Empire to what is possibly the world's oldest democracy among the Haudenosaunee, across Cherokee slaveholders and Osage oil barons, and continuing to the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline, we will read a nuanced and diverse array of primary and secondary sources.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: explicit descriptions/discussions of violence and genocide, racism and racist slurs, and kidnapping/child abuse; it may also touch on sexual assault, ableism, and misogyny.

This course offers a first introduction to the sexual past that seeks to answer this question with a focus on the modern West. It may be less suitable for students who already have a background in sexuality and gender studies.",
    "course_description": "Human sexuality is commonly understood in biological terms, explained as driven by natural instincts and as part of a slow evolutionary process. Sexuality, in this view, is a timeless constant and hardly has a history. This course will serve to demonstrate that much of what is taken for granted when it comes to sex shrouds an often-counterintuitive complexity of historical developments.The first half of the course focuses on the main ways in which sexuality has been (re)conceptualised in the West. These will include the Christian tradition, Freudian psychoanalysis, revolutionary Freudo-Marxism and social constructivism. In the second half of the course, we will examine the main themes around which sexuality became a primary issue of social, cultural political concern since the late 18th century. At the end of the course, students will understand the shifting historical meanings of the term 'sexuality'. They will also have a good sense of the various roles that sex plays in regulating societies, in shaping identities and in informing politics.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: sexualities (straight and queer), non-binary and trans genders, feminisms, nudity, pornography, past and present views of sexuality and gender that do not align with current sensitivities, sexism, misogyny, racism, islamophobia, child sexual abuse.

While Mexico is often associated with various forms of violence (whether the violence of conquest, of revolution, or of criminal enterprise), Mexico is also a country with a long and distinguished legal tradition. In the course we will debate the tensions and complicities between the principles of violence and legality in the making of modern states while also covering the major events in Mexican history between the era of the Spanish conquest and that of the drug wars of the twenty-first century.",
    "course_description": "Novelist Carlos Fuentes once wrote that Latin America was divided between a \"legal country\" and a \"real country\". He meant that the institutions designed for the preservation of the law did little to structure the lives of most Latin Americans. It is perhaps no accident that Fuentes came from Mexico, a country whose long-standing identification with liberalism has always made the gap between the promise of legal rights and the reality of corruption and social violence appear particularly large. In the past decade or so this gap has grown ever more visible, as both criminal groups and the forces sent to combat them have made headlines with the brutality and impunity of their transgressions.In this class we will interrogate both the tensions and the complicities between violence and legality in Mexican history. Students will gain familiarity with the historical events and processes that created the Mexican nation and acquire critical conceptual tools for thinking about violence, the law, and state formation in different historical contexts. Students will also strengthen their writing and research skills, as course assignments will gradually lead up to the production of an end-of-term research paper.",

Source-led, this course interrogates these questions in relation to the history of British masculinity across the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, exploring how concepts and experiences of masculinity were, and remain, tightly enmeshed with the social, cultural and political histories of a country and period.",
    "course_description": "This course examines the history of masculinity in Britain during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Students will be introduced to key concepts and debates within the history of masculinity and gender and will consider how different sources and approaches have led historians to draw very different conclusions about the nature of British masculinity in different periods. By exploring two of these periods together, this course will identify the changes and continuities in how masculinity was idealised, critiqued, formed and experienced in Britain.Using a wide range of sources, from conduct books, novels and private correspondence to caricatures and clothing, the course is divided into four key themes that will consider: the types and ideals of masculinity within societal discourses; how performances and concepts of manhood altered throughout men's life cycles; the relationship between different cultural trends and masculinity; and how cultures and experiences of masculinity were shaped by intersecting factors such as social status, race, and sexuality. Overall, the course will demonstrate how to interrogate primary sources through the lens of gender, and the importance of gender as a category of analysis when investigating the social, cultural and political histories of a country and period.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: derogatory attitudes relating to sex, gender, sexuality, class, religion, nationality, and race; sexual, domestic and gender-related violence. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course. Students are welcome to approach the course organiser if they have concerns about a particular topic, if they wish to.",

    "summary": "This course explores the strange and fascinating world of early medieval medicine. Although often stereotyped as an age of ignorance and superstition, the period between the fifth century and the eleventh witnessed a transformation of ancient medical ideas. Drawing on material from across Europe, the Mediterranean and the Middle East, this course overturns those persistent stereotypes and provides a new perspective into a world of learning, religion and belief.",
    "course_description": "Ideas about health and illness are critically important in all societies, ancient and modern. Yet conventional accounts of the development of medical knowledge have typically given little place to the ideas of the early Middle Ages, often treating them instead as an era in which classical learning gave way to widespread ignorance and superstition. This course seeks to re-examine early medieval medicine on its own terms. Drawing on material from across Europe, the Mediterranean and the Middle East, it follows the fragmentation and evolution of Roman medical knowledge between the fifth century and the eleventh. Ancient medical theories and practices were transformed as they took root in the new Christian and Muslim societies of the early medieval world.In our seminars, we will follow that process of transformation, discovering a heady mix of science, tradition, religion and magic along the way. You will be reading some of the surviving medieval books of medicine for yourself, and exploring the world which produced them. By the end of the course, you will be in a good position to revisit those stereotypes of early medieval superstition, and decide for yourself whether this really was a medical 'Dark Age'.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

Under the 'clash of civilisations' thesis Islam is presented as a monolithic creed that defies logic and rational explanation.

The study of medieval Islam will provide students the opportunity to reflect upon a period of history that was instrumental to global developments and in the making of Europe.",

The development of Islam and the medieval world it gave birth to is a history of diversity, scientific advance and intellectual ferment. Islamic rulers both conquered lands thus unifying peoples under a pan-Islamist entity but their empires were also the product of incorporation and synthesis.The main aim of this course is to examine the history of Islam as it spread across Arabia to Persia and India in the east, through the Levant to the outskirts of Vienna in the north and through North Africa to Spain in the west. The period under study will begin with the high point of Islamic expansion under the Umayyad and Abbasid empires and then focus on the period of transition and fragmentation that followed, including the proliferation of different sects and branches of Islam. This will be followed by an examination of three major dynasties: Safavid Persia; Mughal India; and the Ottoman Empire. The chronological framework will have distilled themes for exploration, which will be examined in term two. These will include the development and exchange of ideas, technological innovations, spread of material culture and science and learning, role of women and religious minorities and the place of art. The course will end with a consideration of the contribution of Islamic thought and philosophy to the modern world.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

    "course_description": "The course examines the political, literary and cultural life of Early Stewart Scotland. The course deals with documentary sources [Parliamentary and legal records, Great Seal Registers etc.] and literary texts. The chosen texts will be analysed to determine what they reveal of the outlook and concerns of authors and audiences in their immediate Scottish context, but also as examples of wider medieval European debates or concerns. Thus, for example, Barbour's Bruce provides an insight into the martial aristocratic culture of late fourteenth-century Scotland but is also part of a broader movement questioning the nature of 'true' chivalry and knighthood across Europe in an age dominated by war. Students will develop skills in understanding and reading primary sources as both the product of very particular circumstances and of longer-term intellectual, artistic and social movements. They will also heighten their awareness of the demands and expectations of genre in shaping the form and content of medieval sources, and the importance of language choice in composition.The course outlines the political and chronological developments that shaped late medieval Scotland through study of a series of documentary and literary texts [in translation] representing production in three of the four literary languages of late medieval Scotland [Scots, Latin and Gaelic]. The literary texts have been chosen to illustrate the contrasting and varied 'voices' and interests of the inhabitants of the medieval kingdom and different ways of understanding the nature and workings of medieval society. The sources will include: chronicles, most notably Walter Bower's Scotichronicon, and Andrew of Wyntoun's Original Chronicle: parliamentary and legal records; literary works such as Barbour's Bruce, the King's Quair, The Buke of the Howlat, the Book of the Dean of Lismore; devotional works such as The Scottish Legendary; advisory texts such as Gilbert Hay's Buke of the Order of Knighthood.",

    "course_description": "At the turn of the fourteenth century the Mediterranean was on the brink of a series of major religious and political transformations which would shape the region for centuries to come. In the central Mediterranean the major powers of Western Europe were embroiled in the War of the Sicilian Vespers, in the East the last Latin Christian crusader outposts had fallen to the Mamluks of Egypt, and in Greece and the Aegean the Byzantine Empire was on the verge of being consumed by Turkish warlords in Anatolia, amongst whom were the Ottomans.Yet in this period of extreme instability, a number of remarkable merchants, pirates and crusaders were able to carve out their own domains in the Mediterranean, motivated by profit and adventure, but also by religious zeal and a desire to defend their lands from those who they perceived to be enemies of the faith. Some of these individuals gained fame and fortune for their maritime daring, as well as favour from popes and kings for their role in fighting the enemies of the faith. However, others were attacked for their ruthless policies and even had crusades proclaimed against them for allying with Muslims and enslaving their fellow Christians.This course will focus on a number of these individuals, including Roger of Lauria, the Italian admiral who was the commander of the Aragonese fleet during the War of the Sicilian Vespers, the Genoese adventurer Benedetto Zaccaria, who established a crusader dynasty on the island of Chios, the mercenary Catalan Company, who ravaged Greece and Anatolia before ruling Athens as a pirate-duchy from 1311-1388, and the Order of the Knights Hospitallers, who governed Rhodes until 1522. The course will utilize a range of translated sources, including documents from the archives of the Vatican, Genoa and Venice, merchant handbooks, crusade treatises, travel narratives and chronicles, especially the account of the Catalan mercenary Ramon Muntaner.",

They will interrogate the utility and problems of the very concept itself. They will also study responses to genocide in the form of 'humanitarian intervention' and war crimes trials. The cases will be drawn from across the world: Asia, Africa, Europe, the Americas and Australasia, with perpetrators ranging from imperialist powers to fascists, communists, nation-state builders, 'developmentalists' and counter-insurgency fighters, and 'enablers' ranging from structural features of the international political economy to regional and world powers and the contours of the Cold War.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

    "summary": "In most societies, gift-giving acts as a critical form of social currency. Gifts mark special occasions such as birthdays; they cement diplomatic relationships; they act as bribes and charitable offerings. Gifts and gift-exchange can therefore tell historians much about the social, political, and moral norms of past societies. This course examines the fascinating histories of gift-giving in a cross-period and trans-regional context.",
    "course_description": "The basic principle that a gift is never given without the expectation of something in return was first determined by the sociologist and anthropologist Marcel Mauss in 1925. Since the publication of his Essai sur le don - 'Essay on the Gift' - historians have used this basic principle to understand gift-giving in a wide range of contexts and past societies. After becoming familiar with the principle of reciprocity and the history of its development, we then move on to examine the varied phenomena that historians have used this principle to explore (including: charity and philanthropy; gender; colonialism; diplomacy; bribery; corruption). A visit to the National Museum of Scotland at the end of the course will help us to think about why people donate to museums and how the display of gifts shapes our experience as consumers of history.Students are by no means expected to have prior knowledge of all of the periods we study, and an annotated bibliography and independent essay will allow students to focus on a particular gift or instance of exchange in a context that they find most interesting.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: child neglect and child sexual abuse (very briefly, in one of the pieces of set literature in one seminar). While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "summary": "Instead of seeing the ocean from the land, what if we looked at the land from the ocean, with a long-term historical perspective? Focusing on the Indian Ocean over a millennium, from 700 to 1750 CE, this course introduces foundational debates and issues in the emerging field of oceanic histories.",
    "course_description": "In Southeast Asia, there is a common expression: \"The water unites us and the land divides us\". It refers to the archipelagic characters of the mainland and island Southeast Asia, but it also draws attention to the centrality of oceans in connecting humans across time and space. The oceans have historically brought together people from different continents, countries and contexts, similar to a single water body in a deep forest that unites all the animals. On the waters and shores of the seas, many civilizations and cultures have risen and fallen, and thousands of humans have prospered and perished in their insurmountable yet eternal ambition to control the oceanic wilderness. Oceans have been at the centre of world history. After all, oceans cover almost three-fourth of earth's surface. Their impact on the past and present of human life is tremendous as many small seas and big oceans have shaped, and continue to shape, the trajectories of life on earth in significant ways.With a specific focus on the Indian Ocean over a millennium, from 700 to 1750 CE, this course introduces you to some foundational debates and issues in the burgeoning field of oceanic histories. This framework helps us understand the long histories of societies that have transcended national and continental borders and chronological brackets. In the Indian Ocean context, several shared cultures, communities and systems have evolved in coastal Asia and Africa thanks to its peculiar monsoon winds. The discovery of monsoon a few millennia before the Common Era, and the dependence of seafarers on it in the Common Era, created a rhythm in the mobility of ships, people, commodities across the Indian Ocean. This rhythm immensely shaped the ways in which old and new communities, cultures, and countries interacted with one another. Interrelating oceans and monsoons, this course shall explore the diverse social and cultural dimensions of the Indian Ocean on the basis of essays, books, films and fictions. Through some hands-on experience working with sources in multiple languages from the oceanic region, students will develop a nuanced understanding of the complexities of the region and its historical significance. Additionally, the course will provide them with a long-term oceanic perspective on some of the ongoing global climate changes.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: castration, slavery and racial violence.

    "summary": "Historians have in the past few decades addressed modernity in its multiple forms and patterns, de-centralising Europe as the cradle of modern identities and practices. The nineteenth-century Ottoman Empire was a rapidly transforming imperial power with deep-rooted political and cultural traditions, within which the idea of being \"up with the times\" has taken alternate forms.",
    "course_description": "This course offers an introduction to cultural, social, and economic histories of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century, placing it within global narratives of modernity and capitalism. In 1800, the Ottoman Empire spanned a vast territory that connected the Middle East, Southern Europe, North Africa, and Anatolia. Although Ottoman territories steadily shrunk over the course of the long nineteenth century, legacies of Ottoman rule continued to influence diverse populations from Basra in Iraq to Bosnia in Southern Europe. Rejecting Orientalist and Eurocentric frameworks which address the Ottoman Empire as the Europe's \"other\", this course integrates Ottoman paths to modernity into global understandings of empire, culture, and economic transformation.The course begins with a conceptual discussion of global history and the idea of modern in the recent scholarship. The following weeks adopt a thematic and chronological plot in placing Ottoman experiences of state modernisation, military reform, global economic integration, and cultural exchange within global frameworks. We look at the ways in which Ottoman statesmen, intellectuals, labourers, peasants, migrants, and traders crafted, customised, and re-calibrated modern discourses and ways of existence, in a world increasingly connected through European imperial expansion, capitalist markets, and technological innovations. In its rich theoretical content, the course does not provide a country-by-country guide to the region's states, rather, it provides an overview of the overarching themes in Ottoman history that speak to wider histories of the globe.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

The course considers in particular how American government - including the electoral politics, the legal system and administrative capacities - was shaped by and affected people of various social classes including women, wage labourers, African Americans, and Native Americans.

It analyses what this graphic form of source material reveals about political opinion and religious belief, social attitudes and cultural life in Tudor and Stuart England. This was a formative era in print making and such a powerful medium reflects some of the major events and significant forces that transformed British national life during the early modern period.",
    "course_description": "This honours course explores the variety of printed images that were produced in London between 1500 and 1700. This was a seminal age in print making and established the techniques and topics that were to define the medium thereafter. Tudor and Stuart England witnessed momentous events such as the Reformation, the Civil Wars, and the Glorious Revolution. At the same time, it experienced significant change in economy, society and culture. These signal developments are reflected in the graphic art of the period which provides a medium through which to explore the forces that transformed life in Britain during the early modern era.The course will develop skills of identifying the major artists, engravers and publishers who created and disseminated these images. It will help students to recognise the various techniques involved in their production, including woodcut, engraving, etching, and mezzotint. Themes to be explored will include the circumstances that lay behind the making of graphic art, the audiences at which it was aimed, and the impact that it had. These classes will seek to interpret the intricate symbolism and coded messages that this material often contained, and investigate the contemporary political, religious, and social contexts that help to explain its meaning and influence.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

They frequently clashed with some of the more conservative authorities when they tried to improve worship, when they added prayer meetings which were seen as politically subversive, when they tried to impose limitations on community celebrations and popular culture. An understanding of religion and politics as separate fields would have been inconceivable to these people and it is necessary to understand their particularly demanding spirituality as it developed through time, with an emphasis on gendered understandings, how that related to their aspirations for a more 'godly' society and how it contributed to the bitter competitions during the English Civil War which lead to unwanted diversity, regicide, and unprecedented revolutions in anticipation of the Apocalypse.",
    "course_description": "This course will be structured around a broadly chronological spine, starting with the incomplete nature of the English Reformation at the accession of Queen Elizabeth, moving through initial attempts to take it further, transposing into failed attempts to change the structure and practice of the national church, leading to more divisive attempts to motivate activists through sharp satirical polemics and extra-curricular activities. This will be accompanied by initial attempts to define 'puritanism' as an outlook and spirituality. Further public relations efforts to raise support through offering aid to people possessed by demons, leading to a vicious establishment response employing the means of law and print, will be examined. Regrouping after the accession of James VI & I, coping with particular individuals who took their visionary spirituality too far, a more pastorally focussed effort to make change by activism by 'converting' people to a spiritual discipline will be examined, along with campaigns to make a more godly society by suppressing impious festivals and carnivals. As the common ground with the establishment was eroded later in the Jacobean reign and especially after Charles I succeeded to the throne, the consequences will be examined in three strands. The first is the response to harsher discipline of religious practice, removing the ambiguities that meant puritan ministers could compromise and stay within the church. The second is the related growth of a puritan diaspora, partly to New England but also to the Netherlands. The third is the attempt to adapt practical divinity to the new conditions, mixing greater demands and consequent spiritual empowerment as a balance to the suffering. These strands link to the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642.The unprecedented conditions of the mid-century crisis turn attention to the different forms of radical change fostered by these conditions, with bellicose schisms, an uncontrolled press, and an empowered body beyond the magisterial orders, attempting to understand the strains, their roots and ambitions. The strains between radical ambition and the demands of governance will be placed within a millenarian understanding of the immediate need for greater social and religious transformation, with Oliver Cromwell increasing becoming the lynchpin that held it together, a contribution that became clear after his death when the tension made the maintenance of control unattainable. The later work will examine the diverse heritage of the century of puritanism.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: political and religious violence, sexual violence. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "summary": "Taking the refugee camp as perhaps the most iconic symbol of the 21st century African refugee, this course seeks to contextualize the camp within a deeper history of displacement, migration, and humanitarian interventions in the last century. While our focus will be on placing these stories into themes of African history, this course will also engage in global histories as we consider the role of transnational aid organizations, aid workers, and trace the lives of refugees beyond the continent. We will be engaging in these histories through primary and secondary sources to consider the memory, politics, environments, and cultures of migration and displacement.",
    "course_description": "African lives have long been shaped by both forced and voluntary migration due to climate, conflict, labour, colonialism, and the transatlantic slave trade. We will consider the experience and memory of being uprooted as sometimes the norm rather than the exception and one that has been increasingly determined not just by the causes of conflict but increasingly by the institutions and methods of intervention in their aftermath. Starting in the colonial period, we will look at how migration for a variety of reasons shaped the continent while the term refugee was not applied. After independence, African countries have housed millions of refugees since the 1960s while also struggling to provide \"development\" for their own citizens. In this way, refugee histories are also histories of nationalism and state formation, community making, and PanAfrican cooperation as well as exile. We will also consider the ways in which foreign intervention and expertise by the 1980s became the new standard procedure for caring for refugees, leading to refugee camps and the profusion of \"humanitarian devices\" - technologies to alleviate suffering as well as foster social improvement. Lastly, we will follow refugees across oceans and into the diaspora while also sustaining ties back home.This course will be organized each week around a historical question with the goal of attempting to answer it through lecture, course readings, and tutorial. Some of these questions include: How have refugees and refugee organizations co-constructed one another? How has the relationship between memory and exile been shaped at different moments? When did refugee camps become the most common way of housing and caring for refugees? What is the difference between a refugee and an \"economic migrant\"? What is the role of climate in migration and what is the new category of a \"climate refugee\"? Lastly, the final five weeks of the course will also focus on the challenges of conducting historical research generally as well as specifically regarding our seminar's topic. This will include class discussions of oral history, bureaucratic and institutional archives and writing histories of the recent past.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: Slavery, Emancipation, and Migration; Colonialism, Migration and Labor; The World Wars: Migrants, DPs, Refugees; Biafra and Humanitarian Aid in Africa; The Bush Camp: White Minority Rule and Exile in Southern Africa; The Refugee Camp; The Great Lakes Region and Rwandan refugees; Ugandan Refugees in Britain; Somalis in Kenya.

    "summary": "In the years around 1960, new post-colonial states were born across Africa. New states promised a great deal and the expectations of independence were high. But what changed? Did independence make a difference? To what extent did post-colonial states simply adopt the governing practices and ideologies of their colonial predecessors? This course asks how far and in what ways independence constituted a rupture in the political, cultural and intellectual history of twentieth-century Africa.",
    "course_description": "This course explores the meaning of independence in East Africa's twentieth-century history through seminars organised around a series of themes - power and authority, citizenship, nationalism, race and gender. We tackle these themes through a close reading of contemporary texts with a particular focus on speeches, letters to newspapers and novels. Our focus is on late colonial and early independent East Africa, particularly Tanzania but also Kenya and Uganda.We start in the 1940s and 1950s as new political ideas circulated and gave rise to new types of political thinking, at both local and national level. We consider the concept of \"development\" and the ways in which it provided a vocabulary for thinking about what modernity might mean. We then track the rise of new nationalist parties which called for immediate independence, promising that independence would bring the social, economic and political development which new African voters demanded. From there we move to the post-colonial period, and explore the ways in which post-colonial states performed the ideological work needed to build nations, but also the conflicts and fissures which persisted just below the surface.This course engages with current debates in the history of Africa, the comparative history of decolonization and the emerging fields of African and global intellectual history.",

Emphasis will be given to the conflicts between modernity and tradition, as well as the concepts of regional, religious and class identities which have formed the building blocks of modern nationalism in South Asia. Students will examine the struggle to affirm that conception of nationhood, together with the secessionist and centrifugal forces, including politico-religious and revolutionary movements, which have threatened, and even succeeded, in pulling in these nations apart. Attention will also be paid to problems of securing balanced and equitable economic growth since the end of the colonial period, and the origins of the conflicts between the nations of the subcontinent, which have most recently acquired a thermo-nuclear dimension. Importantly, apart from the high politics of political conflict, the course will survey the history of the evolution of society at a local level, including the struggle for the rights and freedoms of women and the lower castes.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

Using a critical and 'embodied' approach, the course interrogates the centrality of categories like race, caste, gender, religion, and class to Indian diplomatic history. It covers topics such as the Kashmir conflict, non-alignment, Afro-Asian solidarity, India's nuclear status, and contemporary Indian discourses of the international order.",
    "course_description": "Indian diplomatic history has largely been concerned with a 'high politics' driven narrative that regards diplomacy as taking place in a bounded 'international' space populated by 'rational' actors. This course takes a different approach, and considers Indian diplomacy and ideas of the 'international' as shaped by the entanglements of Empire. Drawing on recent postcolonial and feminist critical interventions in the field, we will study Indian diplomatic practice and foreign policy through the intersectional lens of race, caste, gender, religion, and class.Beginning in the first decades after independence, we will examine topics including the afterlives of Partition in Indian diplomacy, Nehruvian notions of non-alignment, Indian self-perception as a 'Leader of the Third World', the evolution of India-Pakistan relations, India's attitudes towards the United Nations, and Indian cartographic anxiety about borders. The second semester turns to the diplomatic discourses spurred by the 1971 war against Pakistan: a pivotal moment in the remaking of Indian diplomatic identity and its attendant discourses of regional domination. Many of our themes have significant contemporary resonance, such as Indian discourses of 'national security', the diplomatic significance of the Indian diaspora, nuclear nationalism, and the impact of Hindutva on Indian diplomacy. India's key bilateral relationships vis-Ã -vis Pakistan, China, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Britain, Russia, and the United States are all explored. Utilising a diverse range of primary sources including diplomatic memoirs, documents, biographies, fiction, and cinema, the course will equip students to interrogate the silences of the diplomatic archive and highlight the importance of a nuanced, intersectional approach to postcolonial diplomacy.",

    "course_description": "The course is divided into four parts. Part 1, Contexts and Chronologies, explores the main trajectories of intellectual change in this period. The next two Parts focus on changing understandings of the body, the soul, and the relationship between them, drawing on perspectives from natural philosophy and medicine (Part 2) and from ethical and spiritual thought (Part 3). The final part of the course (Part 4) turns to questions concerning the boundaries separating humans from non-human (such as demons and animals). Emphasis throughout will be on first-hand, close analysis of primary texts, but always in relation to their social, religious, political and intellectual contexts.Seminar topics may include the following: theories of body and soul; boundaries of the human (including gender and the status of women; demonology, witchcraft and possession; animal language and rationality; and the status of 'savages' and 'primitives'); the relationship between classical ethics (Aristotelian, Platonic, Stoic and Epicurean) and Christianity; theological debates about original sin, free will and human agency; ethical and spiritual perspectives on self-knowledge; conceptions of human nature in political thought; historiographical debates about individualism and the secularisation of knowledge.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: sexual violence, racial violence. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "summary": "The Protestant Reformation was potentially transformative for Scottish society, and through its reforming agenda produced new forms of source material for the study of religious and social life. This course explores how the Reformation was experienced across various Scottish communities, with a particular emphasis on local and regional approaches, and on the social impact of reform. It provides opportunities for in-depth research on the new parish church courts (kirk sessions) and their interaction with communities including themes such as gender, sex and marriage, disability, poverty, and the family.",
    "course_description": "The course explores the social and local history of the Scottish Reformation via two distinct halves. The first half of the course explores patterns and debates in the Scottish Reformation's local and regional development. This will provide you with a firm grounding in the overarching nature and interpretation of the Scottish Protestant Reformation. Building on this, it will also enable you to engage independently with key historiographical debates about the dynamics of reform, conflict and co-existence, and religious culture in the parishes. You will have the opportunity to analyse local and regional case-studies to gain confidence in offering your own interpretation of religious change in the sixteenth century.The second half of the course focuses in depth on Scotland's new and unique parish-level church court, the kirk session, and its relationship with local communities after its emergence in 1559-60. The records of this new institution provide unrivalled evidence on a rich variety of aspects of social life, and you will become expert in navigating and interpreting these challenging but vital sources. The thematic structure of this part of the course centres broadly on two key strands of the church's agenda in the parishes, discipline and welfare, each of which enables exploration of wider and critical themes in the study of early modern communities, such as gender, social conflict, sex and marriage, poverty and charity, the family and disability. You will further develop and sharpen your research skills and ability to communicate history to audiences via the varied source-focused assessments in the second half of the course.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: gendered and sexual violence, domestic abuse, ableist attitudes and language. These are encountered in particular during the second half of the course where we explore the disciplinary and poor relief work of the kirk sessions as local courts.

    "summary": "This course offers an in-depth examination of representations of Blackness in Britain and Europe between 1800 and 1950. We will explore the continued development of processes of racialisation, particularly ideas about Blackness (always developed in relation to ideas about Whiteness) within the context of representations of 'race' in art, literature, science, material and visual cultures. We will consider how these ideas and representations have been negotiated, disrupted, and challenged over time, by Black people living and working in the British Isles and in continental Europe.",
    "course_description": "In the first part of the course we will focus on the earlier part of our period, up to the mid-to-late nineteenth century. We will ask how Blackness was imagined in Europe in a range of literary, scientific, artistic and material representations and how Black people were drawn into these processes, or actively entered and shaped them, including, for example, Frederick Douglass' radical use of early photography.In the second semester, we will consider the development of representations of Blackness from the late nineteenth century and into the twentieth century. We will consider how these representations were shaped by the expansion and consolidation of interrelated developments in racial science and imperialism, as well as circum-Atlantic flows of culture. In this part of the course we will look at minstrelsy, World Fairs, Human Zoos and the travelling circus. We will consider how these ideas and representations have been negotiated, disrupted, and challenged, especially by touring Black American and Black British creatives: people of African descent earning a living through performance in Britain and Europe. In so doing we will explore the famous and lesser known lives of Ira Aldridge, Sarah Baartmann, Fanny Eaton and Josephine Baker, amongst many others. This course assumes prior knowledge of the invention of 'race' with racial slavery in early modern Atlantic world, for instance through familiarisation with the pre-reading list provided.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

As we cover this period of more than four hundred years we will consider how the Spanish conquered and colonized the people of the Americas while at the same time paying attention to the resilient aspects of indigenous culture that survived despite efforts of colonizers to eradicate them. We will study Spanish efforts to change local culture through the introduction of a new religion, language, and societal practices and see how specifically these impositions were both accommodated and resisted by native peoples. These forms of resistance were eventually influential in the movements to reject Spanish authority and the course will end with discussions on the various rebellions and revolts in colonial Latin America that ultimately led to the independence of many of the countries.Throughout the course students will analyse primary sources translated into English, as well as study non-textual sources such as paintings, material objects and architecture, that shed light on the colonial experience in Spanish America.",

It investigates the impact of watershed movements like reformations, revolutions and industrialisation upon popular culture, and interrogates popular culture's influence upon the same.",
    "course_description": "What were the attitudes, values and customs of ordinary people in Britain during the late medieval and early modern periods? How can we glimpse these 'popular cultures' of the past, and how did they relate to the broader political, economic and social structures and issues of the time? This course grapples with these questions, making a serious study of those people below the level of the wealthy and elite in pre-modern society: the alewives and artisans, husbandmen and servants, labourers and paupers who formed the vast majority of the population.The course focuses upon the cultural lives of everyday individuals and groups, exploring their belief systems and mental outlooks towards issues like religion, sex, leisure, and politics, as manifested through objects, utterances, rituals and customs. Multiple popular cultures will be considered, touching upon gender, age, and locality, and subjects will include festivities; sports, theatre, and other pastimes; belief and the supernatural; popular protest and riot. The course examines both the influence of popular culture and the changes it underwent in relation to significant movements of reformation, revolution and industrialisation over the course of four centuries. More broadly, it contends with historiographical debates over the legitimacy and value of 'popular culture' as a field of study: can we truly speak of one 'plebeian' culture separate from the elite during this period; and is it necessary or even possible to uncover the 'voices of the people'?Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: domestic abuse, sexual violence, misogyny, racism and xenophobia violence and cruelty towards marginalized groups and animals.

It focuses on 9 case-studies starting the middle of the 19thc and takes us to the 2011 revolutions. The course deepens students' knowledge of specific local contexts across the Ottoman Empire, Iran, Egypt, the Levant, the Maghreb and the Gulf. It is grounded in analysis of primary sources from these cases, ranging from feminist hunger strikes to constitutional reforms, and from political prisoners' writings to photographs and film. The variety of themes and types of sources covered should be of interest to students interested in the Middle East as well as students interested in social, cultural an intellectual history in non-European contexts.",
    "course_description": "The history of the modern Middle East has been shaped by moments of profound change: constitutional revolutions and peasant revolts, anti-colonial revolutions and military coups d'Ã©tat, scientific revolutions and popular uprisings. This course grounds students' understanding of revolution in the Middle East in deeper processes of reform, state-building and sustained social movement. It encourages students to see revolution and reform not as opposite sides of a binary but as processes along a continuum of forces driving historical change.The course moves through Iran, Turkey, North Africa, the Levant and the Gulf starting in the middle of the 19th century and extending to the 2011 Revolts. It provides a survey of key moments of revolution and reform that have shaped the region through an exploration of a series of pertinent conceptual and historiographical questions. In short, it asks: how have revolutions and reform shaped the past and present of the Middle East? It opens with an introductory conceptual discussion on ideas of revolution, reform, constitutionalism, and science. In each of the following weeks, we explore a specific concept or historical agent (eg peasantry, state-sanctioned reform, women's movements, political Islam, carceral regimes) through an analysis of a particular case study. Students are encouraged to draw on conceptual and historiographical discussions from previous weeks as we progress through the course. The course will deepen students' knowledge of histories, geographies and concepts that have made (and unmade) the states and societies of the Modern Middle East.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: colonial and state violence, gender-based violence (including sexual assault), carceral violence (including torture), references to suicide.

    "summary": "In this documents-based course students will compare the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804), which led to the first complete abolition of slavery in world history and produced the world's first black republic, with the more top-down process of abolition in the British Empire. Students will also investigate the interaction of and connections between the two processes. The course will begin with an assessment of the British and French Atlantic slave systems, before examining the causes, process, and consequences of the revolution in Haiti, the debates and controversies in Britain and the slave colonies that led up to emancipation, and the immediate aftermath of emancipation. We will also consider how the history of slavery and its abolition is remembered or forgotten in today's world.",
    "course_description": "The abolition of slavery was a crucial part of the Age of Revolution and the shift towards societies dominated by liberal ideas. This course enables students to study the process in depth in the societies of the British and French Atlantic Empires. We will consider debates about slavery and race in metropolitan Britain and France as well as the process and outcome of emancipation in the Caribbean colonies. Central questions for students to consider include: Why did slave emancipation take place at the time and in the manner that it did? What can we learn about the cultures and world views of enslaved people and former slaves from what we know about how they acted in the process of achieving freedom? What were the gains and limits of emancipation? What difference did revolutionary compared to state-led abolition make to the nature of post-slave society?Students will engage with a range of primary sources, some published in collections of translated sources; others available through electronic collections of original documents and through the course leader's personal collection. They will bring these into dialogue with the work of a range of historians working within different historiographical traditions. This will allow them to appreciate a variety of approaches to understanding, constructing, and interpreting the past. As well as traditional essays, students will be expected to edit a primary source and produce a group presentation as part of the assessment.Indicative course outline:1.

It considers why some colonists in British North America rebelled against British rule while others did not (although thirteen North American colonies declared independence in 1776, an additional thirteen colonies on the mainland and in the Caribbean chose to remain within the British Empire). Among the themes and topics which the course considers are the causes of the American Revolution, the War of Independence, constitution-making, and the social and political development of the new American republic. The course considers the Revolution in a broad, Atlantic, perspective, assessing the geopolitical significance of the creation of a republic in the Western Hemisphere. It also considers the degree to which the emergence of that republic was shaped by and affected people of various social classes including women, African Americans, and Native Americans.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: enslavement Indigenous displacement sexual violence, racial violence. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

Our core questions will be: what was revolutionary about this era, why did revolution occur, and with what results? Students will learn to think historically with different perspectives, considering the view from, for instance, Belfast, Ireland and Port Royal, Jamaica as well as Edinburgh and Westminster. They will sample the techniques of the case study, the comparison, the analysis of large sets of text through quantification, and the deep contextualization and close reading of language. Our approach to revolution will draw not only on political history, but also social, economic, military, and legal history.Students will spend each session analysing and proposing their own interpretations of the primary source evidence.

Weimar Berlin offers an illuminating window onto Europe's past and present ambivalences regarding democracy, liberalism, modernity, social and sexual change.",

It was where deep cultural pessimism after a crushing defeat in World War 1 existed alongside an intoxicating atmosphere of novelty and daring experimentation. Along with art and entertainment, 1920s Berlin became (in)famous as the sexual capital of Europe. This course will use the debates and dynamics concerning sex in this period as lens through which to understand the wider history of interwar Europe, modernity, democracy and totalitarianism. Its first half will focus will the history and historiography of Weimar Germany and Berlin in which films from the period will play a leading role. The second half of the course will zoom in on the life, work and sociotope of Magnus Hirschfeld, the gay, Jewish and socialist sex reformer who championed sexual rights in general and those of the queer and trans communities more particularly.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

    "summary": "The course will ask how early modern people defined, applied, and resisted coercion in labour relations in the British Atlantic world context. We will place transatlantic chattel slavery at the core of the course and also consider indigenous slavery, compulsory agrarian and domestic service, convict labour, indentured servitude, pauper apprenticeship, prostitution, and military and naval conscription. Students will learn the many ways in which historians approach the problem of forced labour.",
    "course_description": "The first part of this course focuses on labour coercion in terms of belonging and exclusion in communities in the British Isles, West Africa, and Indigenous America. Particular focus will be on agrarian, domestic, and military labour. We will challenge the presiding impression that Europe was a place of liberty while Africa and America were places of slavery. The second part of the course focuses on the commodification of labour, especially in long-distance transportation, foregrounding the transatlantic and Indigenous slave trades. Students will learn how traders in captives used violence, displacement, broken kin ties, and imprisonment to establish slavery. Enslaved people's suffering, coping, resistance, and rebellion took as many various forms, making it impossible for enslavers to forget their victims' humanity. The third part of the course will consider the role of coerced laborers in the process of colonisation. Enslaved and forced labour altered natural environments as well as political systems. Work, from the construction of plantations to the overfishing of the sea, contributed to indigenous dispossession and further coercion of indigenous labour, and enabled and accelerated the rise of racial capitalism, with implications on all sides of the Atlantic rim. The course then ends at the Age of Revolutions, treating the role of labour coercion and resistance not only in political and social revolutions, but also in the industrial revolution and attendant environmental change.",

    "summary": "By c.1100 slavery, which had once been a fundamental structure of the Roman empire, had been displaced across much of Europe by a distinct subjugated status known as serfdom - for reasons much debated by historians. Yet simultaneously other forms of  slavery evolved and diversified, including human trafficking along trade routes connecting Christian, 'pagan' and Islamic societies. This course makes sense of these parallel trajectories and explores critical issues, including questions of gender and ethnicity, in the history of slavery c.400-1100.",
    "course_description": "We might assume that ending slavery takes revolution from below or legislation from above. But the end of Roman slavery unfolded much more ambiguously. The story goes that the centuries following the disintegration of the western Roman empire by c.500 witnessed a fundamental transition. The legal, material and social subjugation of men and women under Roman slavery was displaced by a lesser form of subjugation known as serfdom. Historians have vigorously debated the precise chronology and fundamental reasons behind the transition from slavery to serfdom, not least because they have disagreed over how to differentiate slavery from other form  of unfreedom. Slavery in the Early Middle Ages explores why historians continue to debate the demise of slavery and why their debates matter for understanding social, political and economic change between c.400 and 1100.Yet, as some historians have recently argued, rumours of the demise of slavery have been greatly exaggerated.  These same centuries witnessed multifarious forms of slavery persist, evolve and diversify, from variants of domestic slavery to human  traffickingalong trade routes connecting western Europe, Scandinavia and the Middle East. Slavery in the Early Middle Ages examines these other tracks in the history of slavery running parallel to the transition from slavery to serfdom and explores how far the big picture of slavery and serfdom looks different if we think more carefully about distinct experiences of servile women and children. We will also scrutinise how different ways of conceptualising slavery -- as a form of legal subjection, as a mode of production and/or as a form of 'social death' -- affect how we understand the existence, evolution and demise of slavery in past and present societies.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: sexual violence, corporal punishment, human trafficking and ethnic stereotyping. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "summary": "Eric Hobsbawm's famous formula of the Age of Extremes does not apply to all countries of the world in the same way. For instance, the great continuity of institutions and elites in British history contrasts with German history in the 20th century, which was marked by radical breaks with the past. Germany was one of the most modern industrial societies of the time, played a major role in two World Wars, and had the strongest labour movement in Europe until 1933, yet it produced the deepest breakdowns of a civilisation in the history of humankind. The course discusses these radical transformations and how to place them in modern European history.",
    "course_description": "The twelve years of the 'Third Reich' are the inescapable turning-point of German history in the 20th century and form the core of this course. In the spirit of the Reinhard Koselleck's Future's Past concept, however, the course also explores tradition that have been lost, and escaped the attention of historians of modern Germany. Long-term developments and sharp discontinuities will be analysed. The course offers both an overview of 20th century Germany and the opportunity to work on highly specialised questions. The course will give students the opportunity to choose their own topics in which to specialise. Was the Kaiserreich an authoritarian or a highly modern state? Why do German colonial troops commit genocide in Africa in 1905? How were Jewish success and anti-semitism linked before 1914? Was the German government responsible for the outbreak of World War I? Why did women's suffrage come earlier in Germany than in Britain? What happened to German colonialism after 1918? Did the German Revolution of 1918 fail? Was the Weimar Republic a mecca of modern architecture, jazz and nightclubs? How do we explain the rise of National Socialism? How far back does one have to go back in history in order to 'explain' the Holocaust? Did the Nazis establish an empire and colonial rule over Europe? Was the GDR the \"better Germany\" around 1950? What remained of German Marxism after 1933? What does the term denazification mean? How do you explain the terrorism of the 1970s? Why did the Berlin Wall fall in 1989? Next to contemporary key texts students will analyse sources from literature, paintings, photos and film. Throughout the course the history of 20th century Germany will be placed in relation to European and global history.",

This is a story which also has wider implications for how we should understand the history of East Africa and the Indian Ocean world more broadly.The course focuses mainly on the period from c. 1830 to 2009. The start and end points mark particular moments in a long history of changing relationships with the wider world. The 1830s represent a new phase in relationships with the Indian Ocean world, with the development of the Western Tanzanian town of Ujiji as a centre of trade with the coast and the Indian Ocean world beyond. The course ends with the 2000s, a decade marked by the rapid expansion of Chinese investment in Tanzania and representing a new phase in Tanzania's relationship with East Asia.",

We will trace this history of othering from the eve of European colonialism through the modern day, with semester one dedicated to the period of colonial rule (ca. 1450 to ca. 1820) and semester two looking at the modern period (ca. 1820 through the present day).",
    "course_description": "As a balance to the dominant histories that understand Latin America from the perspective of centrally organised nation-states and mainstream societies, we will examine how the existence - or even just the perception - of othered communities has shaped national identities, cultures, and political economies. Through an historical analysis of the 'other' we can reimagine Latin America not as a cluster of inclusive, imagined communities--as Benedict Anderson would famously argue--but instead through the active exclusion of specific groups and ideas. We will measure how this exclusion was ideological, physical, and cultural. And more than just a study of subaltern or marginalised groups, we will focus on the process and implications of how certain Latin Americans were defined as subversive, exotic, heretical, perverse, or a litany of other terms intended to isolate and exclude. The range of groups studied will include indigenous communities, women, Afro-Latin Americans (before and after slavery), peasant farmers, workers, political dissidents, LGBT communities, exiles, and migrants.Emphasis throughout will be on first-hand, close analysis of primary texts, both by famous figures like conquistadors, political leaders, and intellectuals, and also from the othered communities themselves. Please note, we will only use materials that have been translated into English; no knowledge of foreign languages is required for this course.",

Students will closely read Jefferson's writings and place them in context. The course will focus on primary sources while grounding their reading in the rich historiography on Jefferson and his time.",
    "course_description": "The course considers Jefferson's role as a republican theorist, partisan political leader, and as a state governor, Secretary of State, Vice President, President of the United States. It will examine the origins, limits and achievements of republican government in early America. Although students will focus on the career and writings of Thomas Jefferson, the course is intended to introduce students to the major concerns and questions - political, ideological, and social - which shaped Jefferson's world and his various contributions to it. It places Jefferson's thinking and life in the context of the Atlantic world and the Enlightenment. Among other themes it considers Jefferson's thinking with respect to democracy, westward expansion, the global republican movement, the transatlantic revolutionary tradition, and race and slavery.",

Since the 1980s, there has been a stream of research monographs about civil rights, and that trend has accelerated in recent years, with the result that conflicting schools of interpretation have emerged.  The course seeks to provide students with a good understanding of the Civil Rights Movement's origins, development, composition, and long-term impact.",
    "course_description": "The course examines key themes in the history of the Civil Rights Movement and its legacy from its origins until the 1980s.  Key issues include the tracing and dating the movement's origins; the question of continuity and discontinuity in the civil rights struggle; the role of the federal government, women, religion, and organised labour; the Cold War and the civil rights movement; the utility of nonviolence and violence in the civil rights movement; the role of Martin Luther King, Jr.; the disintegration of the national civil rights coalition; the civil rights movement in the North and West; the post-Selma southern civil rights movement; and the movement's longevity and long-term impact.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: racism, racial violence, sexual violence, misogyny, patriarchy, sexism, homophobia, classism, archaic terminology, religion, politics, identity.

Not only was slavery abolished and the nation reunited under a newly powerful central government but the meanings of American freedom and equality, of manhood and womanhood, of race and citizenship, were also redefined. These transformations are the main subject of the course. We will begin by investigating the background and causes of the Civil War and go on to explore topical aspects of the war itself, such as women's experiences, emancipation, and dissent. We will also examine how the consequences of the war remained contentious issues throughout Reconstruction. The final part of the course considers how the war has been remembered over the past 150 years, highlighting connections between contested memories of the war and politics, culture, and racial struggles.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

    "summary": "Archives provide the basis for historical scholarship and the sandbox for historical training. But until recently, most historians did not question why repositories were created, how they were organised, which documents were collected, who could access them - and who could not. By reflecting on the emergence of colonial, scientific, literary, and political archives and libraries during the eighteenth century, this course will consider how collections have fashioned the Enlightenment - as a set of values and as a historical event - among historians and their readers in Britain, the Caribbean, France, and Spain.In collaboration with archivists in the university's Centre for Research Collections, students will gain first-hand experience with practical skills, including archival appraisal, cataloguing and metadata, handling and rehousing. They will have the opportunity to work with primary collections to better understand how and why the archival turn has shaped historical and archival practice.",
    "course_description": "Over the past two decades the \"archival turn\" has led historians to recover the principles that have shaped collections of documentary sources, and to reflect on their social meaning over time. In Britain, the creation of national collections of archival records, manuscripts, and printed books coincided with efforts to create accessible repositories of scientific and historical knowledge - in exhibitions (such as the Repository of the Royal Society, 1661) and in print (such as Thomas Rymer's Foedora, 1704-32). To what extent did these documentary projects shape perceptions of the national and imperial past? By focussing on the social meanings of eighteenth-century archives and libraries, within and beyond Europe, can we discern the values historians associate with Enlightenment?Students on this course will consider the history of archival, material, and print repositories during the \"long eighteenth century\" and the design of electronic databases that cover this period (including ESTC and ECCO). Next, we will examine the ways in which these and other repositories have fashioned the production and dissemination of values and ideas associated with Enlightenment and the history of the eighteenth century. By comparing case studies from across geographical regions, including the Middle Passage and the Caribbean, we will think about the links historians have made between information and knowledge, and between evidence and history.Through a series of practical training sessions with archivists, students will develop specialist technical skills that will enhance their ability to identify, trace, and to think historically about the archival basis of historical narratives - doing so in the Centre for Research Collections or online. With so many of us depending on virtual stores of information, this a timely course that will help students see the intellectual origins of databases in the archives, and to consider the social meaning of documentary collections.",

Twenty-nine countries were present, representing over 1.3 billion people, a majority of the world's population at the time.

    "course_description": "The course starts by setting the Bandung conference in its immediate context - in Bandung, in Indonesia and in the political context of the Cold War and the birth of the post-colonial world. We then move away from the conference itself to consider the roots of anti-imperialist thought and Afro-Asian solidarity from the late nineteenth century, before moving on to explore anti-imperialist thought from a series of angles including revolution and violence, socialism and economic thinking, religion, culture and universal human rights, with an eye to comparisons and connections across time and space. Running through the course will be an interrogation of competing ideas of freedom, its meaning and the best path towards its realization.",

    "course_description": "This course aims to consider the revolution in British foreign policy that occurred between 1902 and 1925 through the relationship between foreign, strategic and economic policy. In the late nineteenth century and for much of the twentieth century Britain was simultaneously a European, American, Asiatic and African power. The purpose of this course is to examine the ways in which British policy-makers manipulated their foreign and defence policies to maintain Britain's overseas interests, with particular reference to the \"continental commitment\" to Europe. The chronological period covered by the course includes the time when Britain arguably reached the apogee of its global power, yet signs of decline in Britain's global position were also becoming apparent. The topics that will be examined will include: the composition and ideologies of the policy-making elite in Britain; the influence of the Treasury, and more generally of economic constraints, on foreign and defence policy; the government of the British empire in the early twentieth century; the place of the Foreign Office in the making of British foreign policy; the decision to rebuff German advances for an alliance but to negotiate an alliance with Japan and ententes with France and Russia at around the turn of the century; the formulation of British defence policy from the conclusion of the Boer War to the start of the First World War; the decision to go to war in 1914; the development of war aims during the First World War; the changing nature of the foreign policy making process under Lloyd George; the problems of peacemaking and the \"New\" Diplomacy.  The course looks at a familiar topic in a new light, employing the mythologies and approaches of International History.The resources of the NAS, NLS and online databases provide opportunities for original student work in this area.

    "course_description": "The crusades are a very distinctive and extremely significant aspect of the medieval world, whose influence is still deeply felt to the present day. This course aims to introduce students to some of their major themes, as well as their evolution through time from the 11th century to the 13th, and their interpretations by scholars. These major themes will include topics such as management, legitimacy, criticism of the crusades both within and outside Western Christendom, the background of the participants, warfare, the crusader states, as well as the legacy of the crusades. The course will also consider some key expeditions, from the conquest of Jerusalem to the late medieval campaigns. Moreover, it will not focus only on the crusades directed to the Holy Land and the Middle East, but will take a pluralist approach that considers also other theatres, from Spain to the Baltic Sea, as well as the crusades that involved Byzantium and the \"internal crusades\", that is, the crusades that targeted heretics and political enemies inside Western Christendom. Indeed, the same variety will apply to a series of primary sources that will be examined, which includes Western, Jewish, Byzantine and Muslim accounts, and thus portraying a great variety of views and different perceptions of the phenomenon.Please note, for session 2017/18 this course is taught by Dr Kirsty Day in Semester 1 and Dr Gianluca Raccagni in Semester 2.",

    "summary": "As the huge empire created by the ruler Charlemagne fragmented, his heirs embarked on a desperate and ruthless struggle for power. This course looks at how one of the kingdoms that emerged, Lotharingia (855 - 869), was engulfed and eventually destroyed by a divorce scandal, in the process brilliantly illustrating the entangled dynamics of politics and culture in early medieval Europe.",
    "course_description": "This course explores the intersection of politics and culture in early medieval Europe through the strange fate of the Carolingian kingdom of Lotharingia. The slow-motion collapse of this kingdom, linked to an extraordinary marriage scandal, is uniquely well-documented, through secret treaties, letters both confidential and public, the minutes of staged show trials, records of tense summit meetings, learned legal advice, and rich and often spiteful contemporary narratives. Drawing on these sources, students will explore key themes in early medieval European history, including the contested meaning of empire, dynastic rulership, the evolution of queenship, the use of the written word, legal pluralism, the impact of the vikings and the changing role of the papacy.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: violence, sexual violence, abortion, incest, and intolerance. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

Even today, the year 1453 is regularly used to signify the end of the Middle Ages. This momentous event will be explored through a range of sources, from eyewitnesses serving on the Greek and Turkish sides, to the accounts of Venetian and Genoese merchants in and around the city. By focusing on these different sources, students will be able to analyse this event not only in the context of the Western medieval world, but also from the perspective of the Byzantines and the Ottomans.",
    "course_description": "In the early fifteenth century with most of the Balkans under the domination of the Ottoman Turks, Constantinople, capital city of the shrunken Byzantine empire, held out behind its formidable defences. But how exactly were the Byzantines able to resist Ottoman pressure for so long, and how was Mehmed II ultimately able to conquer the city when so many others had failed? What role did the western European powers take in assisting the Byzantines against the Ottomans, and how important were factors such as religion, commerce and diplomacy in the fragmented world of the late-medieval eastern Mediterranean? These are some of the key questions which this course will tackle.The first half of the course examines the background of the decline of Byzantium and the rise of the Ottomans in Anatolia and the Balkans, with particular emphasis given to the key protagonists in the region: the Ottoman Turks, the Byzantines, the papacy, and the Genoese and Venetians. The failed Crusades of Nicopolis and Varna will be discussed, along with the accession of Sultan Murad II (1421-1451) and his unsuccessful attack on Constantinople in 1422 following the ill-judged attempt by the Byzantine emperor to back a rival candidate for the Ottoman throne, and the subsequent Byzantine attempt to secure western military aid at the Council of Florence. The second half of the course includes a detailed examination of the many contemporary accounts of the siege of 1453 launched by Murad's successor, Mehmed II (1451-1481) and considers the political, strategic and military factors that enabled him to succeed where so many before him had failed. Finally, the response to Mehmed's victory and the failure to mount any effective counter-attack will be considered. The course will give students wide scope to pursue their own interests within the course topics, whether they be in the study of Italy, Byzantium and the Ottomans, or in military, art and intellectual history.",

    "summary": "In 1553, the sole surviving ship of the English Merchant Adventures reached the shores of Russia, where the English were warmly welcomed by its current ruler, Ivan the Terrible. A trading partnership, and later a diplomatic relationship, swiftly followed, uniting the two kingdoms in amity, but likewise trapping them in a unilateral relationship. In this course, we will explore the first hundred years of the Anglo-Russian relationship.",
    "course_description": "The course introduces students to early modern Russian history through the perspective of Anglo-Russian diplomatic and trading relations. Despite their shared European and Christian heritage, the two countries maintained vastly different socio-political and cultural structures, leading the English to nickname Russia a 'rude and barbarous kingdom'. It was, however, a place of extensive mercantile wealth and natural resources, as well as royal generosity. For the majority of the relationship, the English were permitted to trade tax-free and were seen as the favoured nation. There were even discussions about Ivan the Terrible marrying Elizabeth I.The course explores the relationship between England (later Britain) and Russia from three perspectives: trade, diplomacy and exchange. We will consider questions such as why Russia was seen as an important trading partner and what were the chief imports/exports ferried by the English Muscovy Company. From a diplomatic perspective, we will consider the consequences of different political aims of the two countries and examine instances of diplomatic tension. How did one appease a ruler such as Ivan the Terrible? We will likewise examine the perceptions of Russia and its people as expressed through contemporary English travel and diplomatic writings, whilst also exploring the lives of English/Scotsmen who entered the Tsar's service. In the process, we will consider broader issues of maritime exploration, premodern diplomacy and the legacy of the first 100 years of Anglo-Russian relations. The course will likewise introduce you to the emergent field of 'new' diplomatic history.",

    "summary": "This course considers the era of the witness by examining the testimony of trauma survivors and its impact on contemporary history, historiography, and collective memory. 'Bearing witness' as practice, and by extension the application of survivor testimony to historical methodology, has shaped the way in which genocide is perceived, assessed and remembered. This course provides an historical overview of these complex relationships by discussing the links between trauma, memory and history through the case studies of the Holocaust, Cambodia, the Bosnian war, and Rwanda.",
    "course_description": "After decades of recorded Holocaust survivor testimony, historians in the 1990s began to use these oral sources in conjunction with more traditional documents to construct a complex picture of not only the Holocaust but other sites of recent trauma. This change in approach was both exacerbated and facilitated by events unfolding in the 1990s, including conflict in Bosnia and Rwanda. But what does this process mean for historical investigations of genocidal events? And for those who survived these genocides? And how are traumatic events remembered locally, nationally, transnationally, and even beyond these boundaries? And what does it mean to 'bear witness'? The course will address these questions from an inter-disciplinary perspective with a focus on contemporary history. The first part of the course discusses the intersections of memory and genocide, while providing the necessary theoretical background for engaging with these topics. The focus then shifts to examining a series of case-studies: The Holocaust, Cambodia, former Yugoslavia (Bosnia), and Rwanda.The application of testimony to history has since had a significant impact on the way in which genocide is not only written about but also remembered. The second part of the course will therefore explore this trauma memory through oral history, texts, memorials, and other various sources related to the case studies mentioned above with the aim of developing a deeper understanding of how survivor testimony impacts the historiography of traumatic events. Following from this, the concluding segment focuses on the  intersections of bearing witness, history and collective memory by examining commemoration and representation of trauma with reference to the Holocaust, Cambodia, Bosnia and Rwanda.",

    "summary": "How and why does a dictatorship last forty-five years, pursue close relations with Nazi Germany, exile its opponents, prosecute a bloody colonial war, and then get forgotten? This course is an in-depth study of twentieth-century Western Europe's longest-lasting, but least studied, dictatorship: the Estado Novo (\"New State\"). It explores how a dictatorship at Europe's edge rises, rules, and ends across almost half a century.",
    "course_description": "This course focuses on Western Europe's longest lasting, but often overlooked, dictatorship: Portugal's Estado Novo, or New State, c. 1930-1974. Led for most of its life by one man -- AntÃ³nio de Oliveira Salazar -- the regime emerged first as an authoritarian reaction to the chaos of the Portuguese First Republic. In Europe's \"fascist era\", Salazar borrowed from and cavorted with Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany, but the regime defied easy categorisation: Salazar pursued close relations with his Oldest Ally, liberal and democratic Great Britain, emphasised the centrality of Catholic social teaching, and espoused an old-fashioned, even nineteenth-century view of Portugal as a civilising colonial power.How did such a regime -- politically ambiguous but recognisably retrograde -- survive for so long in Europe's short twentieth century? That is the question that we will study on this course, beginning with the kind of regime Salazar established, moulded, and shepherded though the 1930's and World War Two. We will then move to study the regime's surprising integration into NATO, participation in the Marshall Plan, and eventual inclusion in the European Free Trade Association, all the while persecuting political opponents through secret police and controlled repression. In turn, we will study Portugal's ever-widening social chasm with Western Europe and Salazar's increasingly fevered colonial wars against the independence of Portugal's African colonies. Finally, we will examine the regime's demise -- a revolution born in both Europe and Africa -- and Portugal's sudden democratic transition.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: violence, murder, political repression, exile. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

Students will gain a familiarity with themes in recent historiography on the Atlantic world and the history of race, as a framework for discussing primary sources. In encountering a range of visual, textual, and material sources, students will be encouraged to consider how attitudes towards evidence and early modern science and medicine have been entangled with societal assumptions about human nature.",
    "course_description": "Over the early modern period, Europeans began to assemble new accounts of race. At the end of the Middle Ages, ideas of human difference were conceived as environmental, social and cultural, and therefore largely malleable. By the end of the Enlightenment, in the context of colonial empires, human difference had become biogeographical: related to one's biological and geographical origins, and to a great degree fixed. How did this happen? This course will address the ways that European intellectual traditions and habits of collecting and narrating contributed to this shift in assumptions about human difference.

    "course_description": "In the past seventy years, Europe has undergone massive social change and political upheaval. For better or worse, Marxist ideas have played a crucial explanatory and motivating role in many of these transformations. Different forms of Marxism have underpinned Communist politics in the East and West, given shape to powerful social movements, and provided the justification for radically new economic models. The collapse of the Eastern Bloc and the Soviet Union in the early 1990s was widely expected to put an end to this influence but, in recent years, new forms of Marxism have emerged to challenge neo-liberalism and the structures of financial capitalism. By looking at a mix of classic and lesser-known texts by historians, political thinkers, activists, politicians and novelists, this course will explore the diversity of Marxist and post-Marxist thought in contemporary Europe. There will be a strong emphasis on a global approach to European intellectual history, and the readings will encourage students to reflect on the relevance of utopian thinking, the dangers of revolutionary politics, and the continuing importance of social critique.",

    "summary": "The way we order the natural world has always shaped our culture, beliefs, politics, and indeed economic choices. Between c. 1200 and 1750, Europe fostered many of the institutions and practices that still shape our assumptions about the order of nature: universities, with their communities of scholarship and debate; regimes of mass media; telescopes for stars and microscopes for microbes; scientific academies; and archives for collecting global data. This course will allow students to gain a critical understanding of these developments through a range of primary sources, including some housed in EdinburghÂ¿s own libraries and museums.",
    "course_description": "This course will consider major shifts in understanding the order of nature c. 1200-1700. Medieval schools and universities found an order in nature, envisioning an elaborate hierarchy reaching from minerals and worms to the heights of heaven. Throughout the period, scholars and doubters debated this world picture, adding to it and undermining its foundations, until it grew into an entirely different order of nature in the 'New Sciences' of the seventeenth century. Intellectuals of various kinds competed for validity, authority, and prestige; and their thinking had far-reaching social, cultural, and economic effects. This course will explore how understandings of natural order shifted over the period, such as: problems of reconciling human reason and divine revelation; attitudes towards ancient texts and modern material experience; and Europe's relation to knowledge systems elsewhere in the world. Seminars alternate between broad themes and detailed cases, and the assigned essays help students to develop a deeper mastery of both.Content note: The study of history inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.",

The focus is on the July Crisis of 1914 and the interaction between long- and short-term factors in the decision-making process of the various European Great Powers.",
    "course_description": "Few episodes in the history of modern Europe have attracted such intense and lasting historical interest and debate as the July Crisis and outbreak of war in 1914. The chain of events that led to the outbreak of the First World War still offers one of the most dramatic and intellectually enthralling narratives in modern history: it begins with suicide assassins in the service of a extra-territorial terrorist movement and ends with the ultimate exercise in modern international brinkmanship. This course retraces the unfolding of the crisis, beginning with the unification of Germany in 1871 and ending with the entry of the United States of America into the war on 6 April 1917. In addition to analysing the motivations and reasoning of the key decision-makers, the aim of the course will be to focus on such issues as the impact of terrorism on a fragile international system, the role of 'risk' in the calculations of key actors, the relationship between long- and short-term planning, the impact of intelligence, the importance of historical precedent, the significance of inadvertency, error and misunderstanding, and the role played by armaments and military threat analysis. The course will examine the historiographical debates that have raged since the drafting of the 'war guilt clause' of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 and employ archival and other documentary material to evaluate them on the basis of their evidential strengths and weaknesses.  The course looks at a familiar topic in a new light, employing the mythologies and approaches of International History.",

We will explore slavery on a number of levels: as an economic system that allowed enslavers to exploit land and forced labour; as a mechanism of racial control; and as an institution that purportedly exercised absolute control over enslaved people's lives and labour. Reflecting the trend of the last generation of slavery studies, our major focus will be on the lives of enslaved people themselves, exploring their work patterns, personal relationships, social and religious lives, and gender roles and identities.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: warfare, sexual violence, racial violence, racist language, paramilitary violence, terrorism.

His experience encapsulated the intellectual challenges that faced Europeans encountering New Worlds, as well the choices, desires, and habits that early modern Europeans pursued throughout a fast-expanding genre of travel literature that remade the world. This course explores how Acosta and his contemporaries shaped cultures of empire, religion, and science that came to define the early modern world.",

The course works through Acosta and his contemporaries' place in the Spanish Empire, as well as the educational and political frameworks that made them. We'll consider the cultural legacies that they drew upon and transformed, from Christian theology to discourses of natural law and human rights. We'll also look at how they used and modified humanist forms of natural history, and how this became a model for studying the global south; even Charles Darwin, on his famous travels around South America, began with Acosta. Throughout, Acosta's relationship to indigenous informants and his outsized profile in the history of the Atlantic will help us critically probe the colonising world picture he inhabited.",

For each issue, the course investigates key Supreme Court cases, and it explores reactions to them among the public, among interest groups, and among politicians. The course includes a sampling of work by prominent theorists about the issue in question. The final part of the course discusses conclusions about the origins of the 'rights revolution' and its overall impact on American politics and society.",

This course focuses on a number of key developments to consider two related questions. First, how have humans altered the Earth's systems - climate, atmosphere, ecosystems, oceans and landscape? Second, what are the implications of these changes for human society and the relationship between humans and the other species that inhabit this planet? The coverage begins in the late fifteenth century with the Columbian Exchange of diseases, crops, ideas, animals, and people between the Old World and the New World in 1492. It then investigates a number of critical issues relating to land use and the production of food, the exploitative relationships between humans and other species and the impact of industrial capitalism, urbanisation and the use of fossil fuels as the main source of energy. The final section of the course focuses on the post-1945 world,exploring consumer capitalism, the development of the environmental movement in the 1960s and 1970s, and concludes with an assessment of the current climate crisis.",

First, it pays special attention to the activities of the Republican party in pursuit of office and in power. Second, it examines racial conservatism among southerners in the Democratic party and later in the Republican party. Third, it looks at a variety of movements on the Right outside the parties, including some considered extremist and some within the political mainstream; examples of these organisations are the John Birch Society and Moral Majority. Fourth, it investigates the work of contemporary political theorists of the Right and their significance to practical politics. Fifth, it analyses political change at the grassroots level.

    "summary": "This course examines the most controversial event in modern Spanish history, the Civil War of 1936 to 1939. It will consider the origins of the war before studying the main military, political, diplomatic, socio-economic and cultural developments of the conflict. Undergraduates will have access to the wide range of published and unpublished primary source materials.",
    "course_description": "The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) has long fascinated scholars and students alike. To many contemporaries, Spain appeared to be a battleground between democracy, communism and fascism. While this course will recognise the importance of foreign intervention (and non-intervention), it will stress that the conflict was primarily a domestic battle between competing visions of 'Spain'. The course will study the origins of the civil war, rejecting simplistic explanations of an inevitable clash between the 'Two Spains'. It will then examine the military rebellion of July 1936 and the main military, political, socio-economic and cultural developments of the civil war. Finally, it will focus on General Franco's unconditional victory in April 1939, the establishment of Francoist Spain, and the war's long legacy.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: conflict, murder, violence, and political extremism. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

Via a diverse textual and visual source base, we consider from week to week how those in medieval Central Europe conceptualised themselves as part of a wider whole, and how they were viewed by others.

The course pays particular attention to the roles played by race, gender and ethnicity in constructions of British imperialism.",
    "course_description": "This course will introduce students to the key themes, events, and personalities of the Victorian Empire. British imperial power came in many forms and drew on a variety of strategies for rule, including but not limited to: military conquest and subjugation, collaboration with indigenous elites, cultural subversion, and technological hegemony. This course will investigate each of these strategies while also considering the full spectrum of colonial responses which they provoked. However, the course pays particular attention to the ways in which 19th century gender and racial thought shaped the imperial project. Recent years have seen an increasing divide develop between scholars who locate imperial power primarily in the sphere of economics and those who emphasise instead the overwhelming importance of social and cultural phenomena, such as perceived racial differences, gender hierarchies and conflicting interpretations of British nationality. By integrating these increasingly disparate approaches to British imperialism, this module will allow students to develop a multi-faceted understanding of empire which encompasses both metropolitan and indigenous, male and female perspectives. The domestic impact of imperial expansion was massive, and this course will therefore also consider the formative role played by imperialism in the construction of British culture, identity, and economic policy.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

Powerful kingdoms rose and fell; new ethnic identities emerged; and by the end of the tenth century, a 'kingdom of Scotland' had begun to take shape. This course explores the processes by which these developments came about, and introduces students to a formative period in the social and political history of the British Isles.The inhabitants of early medieval Scotland have left few written sources about their life and societies. But their monumental artwork and archaeological remains, along with records from their neighbours in southern Britain and Ireland, allow us to piece together their history. A great deal of the material remains of early medieval Scotland are now held here in Edinburgh, at the National Museum of Scotland. This course offers opportunities for students to engage with this unique and fascinating material for themselves, and to think about ways in which such enigmatic artefacts can be used to introduce the public to this important period in Scotland's history.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources:  violence, including sexual violence.

    "course_description": "The Mongol conquests and creation of the largest land empire in history are the most famous and transformative events of the Middle Ages, and simultaneously the least contextualised. Popularly evoking \"barbarian\" nomadic hordes emerging from nowhere to inflict brutal violence on settled populations, Chinggis Khan and the Mongols are often seen in extremely negative terms - especially in lands once subject to their rule, from Russia across the Islamicate to China. At the same time, popular histories as well as scholars from a range of disciplines have seen the roots of globalised modernity in the unprecedented intercontinental connections the Mongol world empire enabled. So how can we make sense of this contradictory image, and understand what life and society were really like under the rule of the universal khans?This course asks exactly this question, using the dynamic field of Mongol studies to do so. We begin by placing Chinggis Khan and the Mongols firmly in their context, premodern Inner Asia and nomadic statecraft, and engage with cutting-edge historical, archaeological and anthropological scholarship. Following seminars look at the world empire itself, both as a whole and in each region, drawing on a range of sources in translation from Armenian, Chinese, Mongolian and Persian. With this understanding we can engage with some key historical debates, including the movement of goods and global connections brought about by the \"Mongol Peace\", the transfer of culture and pandemic-inducing pathogens in the \"Mongol Exchange\", and the prominent place of women in Mongol society. In our final sessions, then, we'll first look at the conquests of Timur, \"Tamerlane\", and the Timurid Renaissance in Samarqand, to explore the seeming end of nomadic state-builders as major agents of global history. Finally we'll zoom back out to ask what all this tells us about the place of the Mongol world empire in the making of the modern world.",

Students will engage with a wide range of sources (including objects, images, and texts) and historical fields (primarily social, cultural, and intellectual) to consider how war was justified, waged, supported, experienced, and remembered between c.1350 and c.1650.",
    "course_description": "What was the culture of war, and how did its meaning, practice, and experience change during the Middle Ages and Early Modern period? In this course you are introduced to some of the key older arguments about the nature of war and military history during c. 1350 to c. 1650, notably the 'military revolution debate' and 'bellicist' propositions about the contribution of war to the evolution of the modern state. You also engage critically with new research on the 'invention of the civilian' as a protected person in war as well as studies of gender and war, the relationship between technology and war, and on the emotional and cultural meanings of war. Three conflicts receive focused attention (The Hundred Years War [1337-1454]; The Italian Wars [1494-1559]; The Thirty Years War [1618-48]) and there is weekly use of textual and non-textual primary sources, as well as class trips to key war-related sites, collections, and museums including the National War Museum in Edinburgh Castle.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: violence, sexual violence, mutilation, torture, massacre.

    "course_description": "War, commerce, liberty, and empire are closely related themes in the debates that shaped European intellectual culture from c. 1700 to c. 1850. This course examines a broad selection of prominent contributors to these debates. The writings of these authors will, at all times, be related to their wider - intellectual, political, cultural, and institutional - contexts. Students will develop their skills in understanding primary sources as contributions to particular, historically situated controversies. They will be encouraged to recover the historically specific coherence of the arguments made by these authors. Students will also have the opportunity to reflect on the question to what extent arguments from the past continue to be relevant to present-day concerns.The course begins with the debates, in France and elsewhere, over universal empire and the economic foundations of national greatness, which were stimulated by the military campaigns of Louis XIV. In particular, we shall consider FenÃ©lon's Telemachus, one of the most widely read books of the early eighteenth century, and its contexts. The course will then turn to Britain in the aftermath of the Glorious Revolution and the controversies surrounding the second and third edition of Mandeville's Fable of the Bees, which was itself a response to FenÃ©lon, before examining the views of Hume, Smith, Steuart, Melon, Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Ferguson on the place of economic activity in 'modern', eighteenth-century states. The course will then examine the impact of the French Revolution on these debates, focusing on the writings of Burke, Wollstonecraft, and Macaulay in Britain, and Immanuel Kant in the German lands. The course will conclude by examining the thought of Hegel in the context of pos-Napoleonic European politics, and the emergence of Marx's early thought from the intellectual milieu of the 'Young Hegelians'.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

It deals with the Atlantic trade and the transformation of the wine world in the wake of phylloxera. It also seeks to understand why some parts of the world have been more receptive to wine, and to specific variants than others.",
    "course_description": "The course provides an insight into Global History using the prism of wine as a commodity that has had a truly international reach. It aims to compare the social, cultural, economic and political significance of wine in different historical contexts, and to relate these to larger academic debates. The course looks at the global wine and spirits trade (including its association with the slave trade), national crises provoked by diseases of the vine (notably phylloxera in the nineteenth century), measures taken to deal with recurrent problems of overproduction, the impact of the global temperance movement and Prohibition, the relationship between wine and nationalism, and current debates about the globalisation of taste. The course deals principally with the wine industries of France, South Africa, Italy, the United States and Australia, but will also consider consumption and liquor debates in a wider range of countries. The course emerges out of the course organizer's ongoing interests in wine and temperance in South Africa.",

    "summary": "This course examines the experience of criminal justice, policing and systems of punishment from c. 1800 to 2000, focusing on Great Britain and Ireland (located within a broader global context). It centres on three core questions: Who has had access to 'justice' and with what effects? Who has enforced 'law and order' and on whose behalf? What has been the purpose of penal policy and what difference has it made?",
    "course_description": "This course combines exploration of key debates in criminal justice history and historical criminology (relating to security, crime prevention, access to justice and civil liberties) with indepth analysis of primary source materials (including official documents, court reports, newspaper coverage and cultural representations). By examining a period of 200 years it maps changes in policing, criminal justice and penal/welfare policy - as a set of ideals and as lived experience - in relation to broader political, social, economic and cultural transformations (including (post)colonialism, liberalism, the rise of mass democracy, consumerism and total war). The course considers the intersection of class, gender, race, ethnicity, religion and age in shaping identities, subjectivities, and experiences across time.As well as developing understanding of the institutions of law, police, criminal justice and punishment in modern Great Britain and Ireland, the course will develop skills in researching and analysing primary sources (including quantitative data, visual imagery and film).Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: crime, violence, policing, corporal and capital punishment, sexuality. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "course_description": "This course explores the turbulent events and important transformations in Scottish politics from the Covenanting revolution of 1638-41 to the Jacobite rising of 1745.  Building on pre-honours courses in Scottish and British history, the course charts the main developments in political life, examining periods of rapid state-building and intense religious controversy, as well as such decisive turning points as the union of 1707.  The course begins chronologically, discussing the period's successive revolutions and settlements.  It then focuses on political culture and popular participation in politics, drawing on evidence from across the period to examine key themes.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: racial violence, sexual violence, extreme mob violence, state violence. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

The self-conscious ways in which politicians, intellectuals and professionals expressed their concern with Scotland and its place in the world, both in relation to England, Europe and the emerging Atlantic empires, sets this period apart from the sixteenth and earlier seventeenth centuries, and arguably led to a pre-occupation with improvement. The course examines the interplay between challenges at home and the impact of the country's exchanges in people, goods and ideas, especially with the Continent. Amongst others, it looks at the language and intellectual underpinnings of such various projects of improvement as the quest for a Scottish colony, the reform of the universities, the development of the legal and medical professions and the Union debate.The course aims to:- develop an in-depth knowledge and an advanced, critical understanding of processes of modernisation and change in Scotland between c. 1660 and c. 1730;- deepen students' knowledge and understanding of early modern Scottish history;- develop students' skills and confidence in interpreting primary texts;- develop students' analytical, critical and communication skills, in both written and verbal forms.Topics and outline:Historiography; Restoration Scotland; Economic ambitions; Revolution; Political change; Civic aspirations; The Universities; Darien; Union; Post-Union Scotland; Improvement & Enlightenment",

    "summary": "The nineteenth century saw a dramatic reversal of fortunes for Korea. From the longest-ruling dynasty in East Asia (518 years), the demise of the Choson dynasty (1392-1910) precipitated the loss of national sovereignty as Korea was colonized by Japan. Subsequent events - including colonial industrialization, the struggle for independence, and the division of the peninsula into North and South - have only added to the challenge of evaluating the legacies of the Choson dynasty. How did Confucianism influence Korean society? Why did Korea fail to maintain its sovereignty in the nineteenth century? What are the roots of capitalism in Korea? What set North Korea on a different trajectory than the South? This course answers these questions through a survey of the major historical issues that have shaped Korean society and culture from the early modern period through to the present. As well as covering developments in Choson society and Korea's turbulent experience of imperialism, capitalism, nationalism, conflict, and political change, this course also introduces students to the major historical debates that have shaped our knowledge of Korea today.",
    "course_description": "This course provides an overview of early modern and modern Korean history, paying attention to such topics as political systems and Confucian ideology, Choson-era social and cultural developments, the introduction of new forms of agriculture and technology during the Choson dynasty, conflict with both China and Japan, nineteenth-century imperialism, capitalism, diplomacy, and Korea's colonial and post-colonial experiences. Students will read a wide range of historical accounts, including both classic texts and recent scholarship, to learn how to debate historical and political issues related to Korean history, culture, and society. In addition, students will gain experience with primary sources in English, Japanese and/or Korean, in order to conduct their own research into Korean history.",

This honours level seminar invites students to develop a critical understanding and capacity for analysis in these fields. Every year this course will bring students to the forefront of current scholarship on a particular topic in depth (see below), exploring what it means to pursue open scholarly questions in a vibrant academic discipline.Students will encounter and practice canonical and emerging methods, frameworks, and debates in the history of science and medicine. They will work collaboratively to engage and contextualise the current literature and will develop skills in the historical analysis of modern science and medicine. The course's content will be relevant to a range of degree subjects and learning goals and will connect to contemporary questions about science and medicine in society. Class discussions and directed learning will equip students to consider open questions and unresolved challenges in the field.The course is discussion based with an expectation of regular independent reading as preparation for collaborative exploration.2023-24 Topic: This year's topic is data and information as subjects and tools of historical inquiry. What has the history of the census to do with predictive policing? How have classification schemes such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) shaped algorithmic approaches to medical care? What is the relationship between libraries, laboratories, and clinics? And what has the nineteenth century avalanche of printed numbers to do with the impact of Big Data on scientific research?

    "summary": "To read Roman love-elegy is to experience one of the liveliest, most socially-engaged, and provocative literary genres of the Augustan Age written by some of its most celebrated poets: Propertius (c. 50 - 10 BC), Tibullus (c. 55 - 18 BC), and Ovid (43 BC - AD 17). This course aims to equip students to become effective readers of elegy, cognizant of the origins, style and conventions of the genre, of its individual authors and texts, and of the social and political contexts of the early Empire of which it is the product, but which it also constructs and interrogates. In this way, alongside guided reading of the primary texts and secondary scholarship, students will be encouraged to explore how, and with what implications, the elegiac genre experiments and innovates, in particular by expanding its thematic confines outwards from the private world of 'amor' to the public world of 'Roma'.",
    "course_description": "The elegiac texts studied in this course will include selections (usually complete books) from Propertius, Tibullus, and Ovid. The teaching programme is arranged thematically, so that the elegists' handling of the genre and their views on a range issues can be compared and contrasted. Within this structure, lectures and workshops will aim to practise select critical methodologies of use in the study of elegy, with close analysis of the text and tutorial-style discussion of wider themes and contexts.

    "summary": "Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy is a literary dialogue that mixes prose and poetry to describe the author's struggles to make sense of his unjust imprisonment and looming execution in the Ostrogothic kingdom of the early sixth century. This course will provide an extended look at a literary masterpiece that presents the author's profound synthesis of the ancient literary tradition from Homer to Prudentius.",
    "course_description": "Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy is a masterpiece, one of the greatest works of Latin literature ever written. The text is a dialogue between the character Philosophy and the ex-consul, philosopher, and poet Boethius, who had been imprisoned by the Ostrogothic king Theoderic and would be executed before the end of 526. The author writes in his own self-defence; more importantly, he created a profound meditation on fate and free will. As he described a personal journey out of despair, Boethius composed the work in a mixed verse and prose form that invoked every resource of his culture, including Homer, Plato, Cicero, Vergil, Horace, Seneca, Prudentius, Augustine, and contemporary Neoplatonic philosophy. The work's considerable influence is encapsulated in the fact that it was translated by no less than the Anglo-Saxon King Alfred, by Geoffrey Chaucer, and by Queen Elizabeth I.This course will involve in-depth study of the Consolation, its structure, language, relation to other works of Boethius, philosophical and poetic significance, and reception. Weekly readings will include most of the five books of the Consolation in Latin, the rest in English, and appropriate secondary readings.",

The course will examine the intertextual heritage of the Aeneid, its political and cultural context as portrayed within the poem, its thematic and ideological aims, and above all its literary and poetological artistry. The course will delve through a variety of ground-breaking scholarship on the poem, and students will engage with at times fractious schools of thought on important interpretative issues. In addition to the Aeneid, due attention will be given to the tradition in which Vergil was writing (Ennius especially) and to his successors (especially Lucan, Silius Italicus, and Claudian).",

Participants in Latin poets from north of the Po will study the literature and culture of this late republican region, paying particular attention to its two most famous sons, Catullus and Virgil. We will read the former's Elegiac Libellus and the latter's Eclogues, contextualising both poetry-books within their Italian contexts and thinking especially about questions of identity, voice, perspective, and place.",
    "course_description": "The Latin texts studied in this course will include substantial portions of Catullus (some of the polymetrics, all of the elegiac poems) and Virgil (some of the Georgics, all of the Eclogues); a selection of fragmentary poetry and historiography (Cornelius Nepos, Helvius Cinna, Furius Bibaculus); and epigraphic material from the Transpadane. In addition to the relevant modern bibliography on Catullus, Virgil, and late republican Northern Italy, participants in this course will become familiar with scholarship on cultural identity and ethnicity in the ancient Mediterranean.We will proceed roughly chronologically, with the construction of the Via Postumia in 148 BCE and the publication of the Eclogues in 38-ish BCE as our two temporal boundaries and Catullus and Virgil as our central foci. The intertwined themes of cultural identity and geographical place will thread the course together, but we will also attend to questions of gender, genre, aesthetics, ethics, and politics as they emerge and according to our interests. By the course's end, participants will have improved their ability to read and interpret Latin poetry, especially in light of fragmentary evidence and modern theory and historiography.",

    "summary": "Satire is an entertaining, provocative, and powerful literary genre that the Romans claimed as their own invention. Horace (65 BC-AD 8), Persius (AD 34-62), Seneca the Younger (c. 4 BC - AD 65), and Juvenal (ca. AD 60-130s) will be read in Latin with due consideration to genre, literary technique, and ideology. Themes of satire, and so of this course, include society, morality, class, politics, authority, freedom of speech, patronage, literature, food, sex, and obscenity.",
    "course_description": "The satiric texts studied in this course will include selections (usually complete books) from Horace, Persius, Seneca (Apocolocyntosis) and Juvenal. The teaching programme is broadly divided into two phases: the first will introduce the satirists in chronological order, examining in each case what and when they wrote, and looking at what the satirists themselves say about their genre; the second part of the course will focus on a number of themes common to each of the satirists. Within this structure, through lectures and seminars, students will (i) focus on satiric language and style, convention and literary technique; (ii) practise literary-critical methodologies of use in the study of satire; (iii) combine close analysis of the texts with discussion of wider themes and contexts. The following eleven-week schedule (which may change according to the interests of the lecturer) will give an indication of the shape of the course in any given year:Week 1: Introduction: the origins of Roman Satire; approaches to satire ancient and modernWeek 2: Horace: text & context; programmatic satireWeek 3: Persius: text & context; programmatic satireWeek 4: Seneca: text & context; programmatic satireWeek 5: Juvenal: text & context; programmatic satireWeek 6: Satiric themes: class and patronageWeek 7: Satiric themes: gender and sexualityWeek 8: Satiric themes: town and countryWeek 9: Satiric themes: philosophy and foodWeek 10: Satiric themes: epic parodyWeek 11: Conclusion and overview",

The texts will be read in translation but selected passages will be read in Latin. The wide range of texts will provide insight into Seneca's more overtly political as well as philosophical work, allowing us to understand how political and historical factors have shaped his worldview and to trace the development of his brand of Stoicism.

    "summary": "Tacitus' Annals is a highlight of Roman imperial literature and historiography. It gives an unforgettable picture of high politics and foreign relations in the new imperial system in the first century AD. We shall read the text both as a work of high art and as an interpretation of history.",
    "course_description": "Tacitus is the most admired of the Roman historians for both literary artistry and intellectual power, and his final work, the Annals (written perhaps in 115-120 and describing in the surviving portions the reigns of Tiberius, Claudius, and Nero) is among the most remarkable things in Latin prose. A crucial aim of the course is to help students to understand Tacitus' extraordinary style, to understand why it is extraordinary, and how style relates to thought. Next, the course aims to help navigate two valid but contrasting ways in which Tacitus is read: 1. through the insight of the last 35 years that classical historiography is highly artful and creative form, more akin to poetry and rhetoric and less concerned with literal truth than the modern equivalent; 2. as a painstaking historian and a valuable source. As well as Tacitus, constant reference will be made to other literary or epigraphic texts which were known to himor which cover the same events or which share the same lost sources (e.g. Suetonius, Cassius Dio, Res Gestae, Velleius Paterculus, the Senatus consultum de Gnaeo Pisone patre). Students can choose a more historical or a more literary focus in their written work, according to taste.In the coming academic year we will concentrate on the first three books of the Annals, covering the early reign of Tiberius (AD 14-22).",

    "course_description": "The Catilinarian conspiracy was the attempted seizure of power at Rome by the disaffected aristocrat Catiline; it was suppressed by the consul Cicero, who controversially executed five of the ringleaders.  The sources (to be read partly in Latin and partly in English translation) consist of Cicero's speeches to the senate and people during the crisis, his later defence of an alleged conspirator P. Sulla, and the historian Sallust's account of the conspiracy written twenty years afterwards.  In addition to supplying historical information, these sources also represent the best and most exciting oratory and historiography of the late republic.  The course will be particularly valuable in enabling Latin students who may previously have studied little or no Roman history to become expert in a tightly defined historical period (the mid-60s BC) through close study of the literary sources.",

Labelled 'the wisest fool in Christendom', and long regarded as one of the British Isles' less successful rulers, more recently he has been effectively rehabilitated by 'revisionist' historians who argue that he was a highly intelligent and politically astute monarch. The focus here will be mainly on James' ideas, as expressed though his own writings and those of his contemporaries.",
    "course_description": "This course will examine the ideas and writings of King James VI & I, beginning with his rule over Scotland and including England after 1603, as expressed thought his own writings and those of his contemporaries. Like many early modern monarchs,  James was much concerned with his role and destiny as King, and all this entailed. During his reign he faced a number of unique challenges in part brought about by the geography of his realms, including the so-called Highland problem, the Union of the Crowns between Scotland and England, the Ulster plantation and the newly claimed lands in the Americas, as well as religious unrest at home and conflict abroad. This course will take a thematic approach and consider, among others, James' ideas on kingship, religion, war and peace, union, and empire, mainly using primary material.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: witchcraft, anti-Catholicism, racial stereotypes. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

Focusing on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it takes African newspapers and periodicals as an entry point from which to explore the dynamic worlds of intellectual and cultural production in colonial and post-colonial Africa, and political and social change in modern African history more broadly.",
    "course_description": "The course situates African newspapers and periodicals in a comparative global context and interrogates the usefulness of theoretical tools developed in other regional contexts for the study of East African print cultures. We consider why newspaper cultures developed in different ways in East Africa as compared with West Africa. The course engages critically with the often assumed distinction between oral and written forms of knowledge and cultural production, and throughout the course we pay attention to the continuities that are sometimes forgotten in a period of rapid change.The course begins in the late nineteenth century, situating newspapers in the context of existing oral and textual cultures. New forms of textual production such as the newspaper provided a space for new kinds of creativity and the creation of new sorts of publics. We situate these new forms in the political and social context of the colonial period, considering, for example, the implications of colonial censorship and material constraints on intellectual and cultural production through print. At the same time, new textual forms helped to create new political and social identities. We interrogate the question of how far new publics were created in the colonial period, and whether the concept of the 'colonial public sphere' is analytically helpful. The course then moves into the nationalist period and the early post-colonial state from c. 1945 to c. 1975. We explore the nationalist press in the era of decolonization and its use as a tool of nation-building and a space for critique in the early post-colonial state. We then move on to consider the place of newspapers in the cultural history of post-colonial Africa. The final class takes the development of digital publics in the very recent past as a way into thinking about continuity and change and reflecting on the themes of the course as a whole.",

The study of agricultural slavery and related forms of exploitation thus provides a key to the study of slavery in antiquity as a whole. It provides also a key to the study and interpretation of ancient societies and of slavery as a universal system for the extraction of forced labour. In view of the active use of knowledge of ancient slave systems by slave owners in the New World, the study of ancient texts and materials also bears directly on the study of the exploitation of slave and un-free agricultural labour in more recent periodsThe course will explore:1.\tThe potential and limitations of the ancient evidence for agricultural slavery;2.\tThe range of approaches and attitudes to (agricultural) slave labour in antiquity;3.\tThe range of forms and types of agricultural slave and un-free labour;4.\tThe relationship between free and unfree labour in an ancient agricultural context;5.\tDefinitions and concepts of slave labour;6.\tMethodologies and approaches taken by modern scholars to the topic;7.\tComparatist potential and limitations;8.\tDifferences and similarities esp. between Greek and Roman slavery;9.\tDifferences and similarities between agricultural and urban slavery;10.\tThe role of slavery studies within labour studies.",

    "summary": "This course uses the idea of American borderlands as a way to explore the various cultural, political, and social borders that have shaped the histories of the hemisphere's diverse populations for the past five hundred years. Combining the histories of race, nation, migration, and the environment, this class seeks to help reimagine a hemispheric wide process of constructing and crossing borders. A borderlands approach allows us to move beyond the study of isolated nation-states and their assumed polities, to instead trace the deeper histories of encounters along and between any number of social and physical frontiers.",
    "course_description": "In modern times, 'America' is shorthand for the United States, yet at various points in the last five hundred years the idea of America has been invoked by people and nations throughout the hemisphere. In this postgraduate seminar, we will use the idea of American borderlands as a way to explore the various cultural, political, and social borders that have shaped the histories of the hemisphere's diverse populations. Combining the histories of race, nation, migration, and the environment, this class seeks to help reimagine a hemispheric wide process of constructing and crossing borders. From colonial encounters between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous populations to drug trafficking in the 21st century, and from the Canadian artic to Patagonia, we will trace the meanings of American borderlands across landscapes, both temporal and geographic. Placing the official chronologies of nation-states into a common discussion of colonialism and decolonization that includes indigenous and Afro-Descendant peoples, we will trouble notions of historical exceptionalism throughout the hemisphere.As an explicitly comparative course, we will address themes including legal regimes in the borderlands; inter-American power relations; immigration, citizenship, human rights and sovereignty; intercultural and racial mixture and conflict; nationalism, transnationalism, and internationalism; openings and closings of borders; and the multiple meanings and locations of borderlands.",

The tumult that the country experienced then has had significant implications for developments in U.S. politics and society over the past half-century. This course explores the decade's key debates about the United States and the future of the nation.",
    "course_description": "The 1960s in the United States was a time of upheaval, when many Americans engaged in eagerly contested debates about politics and society, with some pursuing reform via legislation, and with others forming movements to take forward a vision for change. This course explores key debates of this 'age of great dreams' and their consequences. It does so through discussion of the lively historiography about this period and through the use of primary sources. The course focuses in particular on competing understandings of liberalism during this period and on the radicalism that emerged as a challenge to liberal ideas. While the Cold War and in particular American involvement in the Vietnam War fuelled many of these debates, the focus of the course is on developments at home rather than the global role of the United States. Among the topics covered by the course are: liberalism at the White House (John F. Kennedy and the New Frontier; Lyndon B. Johnson and the Great Society; race (from civil rights to Black Power); the 'generation gap' (student movements and the 'counterculture'); and gender and sexuality.",

    "course_description": "This course gives students the opportunity to examine the transformation of global politics since the 1970's. Topics will include the impact of decolonisation and the Cold War; the development of the European project and European integration; neo-liberalism in the US and Western Europe; the end of the Cold War, the 'end of history' and neo-conservatism; the politics of human rights and humanitarian interventions; European enlargement; globalisation and anti-globalisation; 9/11 and the War on Terror; immigration policy in Europe and the US; and the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath. The main aim will be to offer a nuanced and historical perspective on questions and themes that remain at the heart of contemporary political debate in 'the West' (and beyond). At the same time, the course will be an introduction to original methodological and historiographical frameworks for understanding the recent past, many of which draw on research conducted in political and intellectual history, the social sciences, philosophy and economics.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: racism; legacies of colonialism, imperialism and anti-semitism; representations of contemporary conflicts; and traumatic memories of war. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "summary": "This course will explore the military forces and infrastructure of some of the ancient world's largest, most powerful and long-lived empires, those of Rome and Persia. It will cover the period from the 1st century BC to the 7th century AD.",
    "course_description": "The Roman Empire was the dominant power in the Mediterranean and controlled up to the 5th century the majority of Europe's population, as well as Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt and Northern Africa. Split from the late 4th century into Western and Eastern Roman successor states, its surviving eastern half remained a dominant player on the world stage up to the first half of the 7th century. As far as Persia is concerned, the course will focus on Late Antiquity, as there is much more concrete evidence for Sasanian than for Parthian military installations. Centred on modern Iran, the Sasanian Empire (3rd-7th centuries) stretched to Mesopotamia in the west, to the western parts of the Indian Subcontinent in the east and into the Arabian Peninsula and Central Asia in the south and north. Until a few years ago, little had been known about its military infrastructure. Recent research has revealed frontier walls and defended compounds of greater dimensions than those found in the late Roman world. It now appears that the Sasanian Empire had an army, which in terms of the scale and sophistication of its military architecture, its capabilities, achievements and, probably, its numerical strength, matched or more than matched those of the most powerful states in antiquity.The course will present the evidence for the organisation of the Roman and Sasanian armies, the monuments they have left behind, and for their deployment in war. It will explore the question how they were able to expand or maintain such vast territorial empires over centuries. In contrast to the Eurocentric perspective of most courses on ancient warfare, this course will seek to demonstrate how the bipolar world of Late Antiquity was shaped by competing superpowers.",

The course will take students through key developments and themes that define the Mediterranean world in this period, and characterize the 'late antique', 'early Islamic' and 'Byzantine' worlds. In this way students will be able to grasp both continuity and change across this period, and across political, religious and geographical boundaries. The course also introduces students to the key sources (literary and material) from the period.In this way this course will serve as the core course for the new cross-school degree programme in Late Antique, Islamic and Byzantine Studies, providing an all-important basis for the more-specialised studies offered by the course options and the dissertation. However, it will also serve as an excellent stand-alone class for students on other programmes with an interest in the 'Long Late Antiquity'.",
    "course_description": "This module, the 'core course' for the MSc in Late Antique, Islamic and Byzantine Studies introduces students to the key developments and themes that define the period as well as introducing them to the key sources, both literary and material and major scholarly debates. This team-taught course draws on the expertise of colleagues across the schools of History, Classics and Archaeology, Divinity, History of Art and Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies. In this way this course is interdisciplinary, involving approaches that could be defined as historical, literary, art historical, archaeology and theological. Sessions focus on both key themes (e.g. 'the holy', Christianisation of material culture, Rome and Byzantium) and key sources or literary genres (e.g. panegyric, Islamic hagiography, Procopius: text and material culture).",

    "course_description": "In many parts of Eurasia, the 1st millennium BC marked a fundamental turning point that was accompanied by the appearance of a whole range of phenomena that were to play an important part in shaping our world. Some of the key elements we might mention are early state formations, urbanisation, coinage, and intercontinental trade networks. In temperate Europe, this age of increasing mobility of people, ideas and goods saw the development of the first urban agglomerations, the appearance of sumptuous aristocratic burials, and close contacts with the Mediterranean world.This course provides an overview on the main developments that took place between c. 800 BC - AD 50, from the centralisation processes of the Hallstatt period (the so-called 'princely seats') to the development of Celtic art, the rise of the Late Iron Age oppida, and finally the Roman conquest.

The roughly two hundred years from the reign of Justinian to the fall of the Umayyads could be summed up in this short sentence.

The course will explore the sixth-century building boom in the countryside (villages and monasteries) and the return of the rural villa in the seventh and eighth centuries (the Umayyad qusur). We will explore the plague and the Late Antique Little Ice Age and their impacts on both urban and rural communities. The course will highlight the most iconic monuments of the early Islamic period (the Dome of the Rock and the Great Mosque in Damascus) and examine them within their Late Antique contexts, while also exploring artistic innovations and new ideas such as religiously motivated iconoclasm and aniconism. We will conclude with an overview of the Near East after the fall of the Umayyads, the rise of the Abbasids and the subsequent move of their power base east into modern Iraq.",

Covering a wide range of primary material and theoretical discussions of it, this course will consider what these different sources reveal and how they have been interpreted.",
    "course_description": "In the forty years since Moses Finley's pioneering and influential study of the ancient economy the quantity of available archaeological data has increased massively; far more is now known about rural settlement patterns, urban production, maritime connections as revealed by shipwrecks, metal and stone extraction, and the origin and distribution of ceramic types on which so many discussions of the economy hinge. Alongside this material evidence, data from inscriptions and papyri, as well as the literary sources previously relied on, are continually being analysed from new perspectives. This course will explore the impact that the recent archaeological discoveries and new methodological developments have had on conceptions of the Roman economy. Drawing primarily on the archaeological evidence and focusing on those issues that these data are particularly well placed to illuminate, this course will also consider the discrepancies between different primary sources (notably archaeological vs textual) and how these have contributed to varying models of the economy. Topics covered include: the economic role of the city; investment in rural production and agricultural specialization; the exploitation and movement of natural resources; the role played by infrastructural projects in reducing transport and transaction costs; the shipwreck evidence; coin circulation and the extent of monetization; technological advances and their impact on productivity; the role of the state in the Roman economy.",

    "summary": "Athenian democracy has long been both the object of in-depth specialist research, and a (positive or negative) model for modern politics. These two aspects have never been fully separated: research on Athens has conditioned its uses as a model for modern politics, but, perhaps even notably, modern preoccupations have conditioned the research agenda of ancient historians. This course embraces both sides of the modern engagement with Athenian democracy. After discussing its past receptions, it proceeds to examine 'our' Athenian democracy, addressing issues such as constitutionalism, democratic deliberation, economic growth, the exploitation of slaves, and the public sphere, and combining research questions from political science and current political debates with rigorous analysis of the ancient material.",
    "course_description": "Ancient Athens is (quite possibly) the first example of a political system practicing democratic governance on a large scale in world history, and by far the best-documented case-study before the emergence in the nineteenth century of modern democracy. Its reception, and its reinterpretation on the basis of later preoccupations starts as early as the Hellenistic period, and is a staple of political reflection from the Renaissance onwards. Athens is for a long time considered a negative model of mob rule, before being rescued by modern liberals in the nineteenth century and promoted to the prototype of a democratic state. Side-by-side with the political uses and misuses, historians have progressively reached a better understanding of Athenian society and the Athenian political system, thanks to rigorous research but also to new questions and new approaches, prompted by their current preoccupations.This course embraces the dualism between political 'exploitation' of Athens as a model and serious historical research. Its aim is for the students to gain the instruments to investigate Athenian democracy in light of their own preoccupations, asking new questions of the evidence which can both widen our understanding of the ancient phenomenon, and shed new light on modern phenomena. After some introductory sessions, and a survey of past 'uses and abuses' of Athenian democracy, each session will concentrate on a modern problem of political life and research, and explore how an engagement with the ancient sources about Athenian democracy can provide new perspectives, and how in turn the modern starting point can help us better to understand ancient Athens.",

We will examine the lived experiences of Black people in Britain by engaging with the struggles they took up and placing these actions in their historical, social and cultural contexts. Over the course of the semester, using a wide variety of texts and sources, we will explore the various ways in which Black people in Britain attempted to drive social and political change.",
    "course_description": "People of African descent have lived and worked in the British Isles since Roman rule. This course focuses on the period from 1800 to the late twentieth century and uses activism as a lens to examine key developments in Black British History. Through weekly seminars, we will explore a range of different types of action for social and political change that Black people have taken and contextualise these within local, national and global events. Using a range of texts and sources focused primarily on English and Scottish case studies, we will discuss what constitutes activism, consider different strategies and types of action taken. In so doing we will examine personal narratives, intellectual leadership, poetry and prose, as well as campaigning, organising and other forms of direct political action. The course provides the opportunity for students to develop their knowledge of gender and race in British History as we consider the impact of Black activism on British society over time. In seminar discussions, we will also reflect on and contextualise present day anti-racist social movements including Black Lives Matter.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: sexual violence, racial violence. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "summary": "Early medieval writings are filled with strange and often bizarre details about human forms and human natures. Poets could be found imagining gory dialogues between rotting bodies and incorporeal souls; theologians scrutinized anecdotal reports about people who had the heads of dogs to work out whether they were humans or animals; and popes retold cautionary tales about demons which hid on leaves of lettuce, waiting for incautious nuns to eat them. This course aims to make sense of the way that men and women in the early Middle Ages (c. 400-1000) understood, theorized and speculated about bodies and souls during a period of religious and intellectual diversity.",
    "course_description": "In this course, we will explore the ways in which men and women in early medieval western Europe thought about questions of body and soul. These were questions which related closely to some of the most important themes in medieval intellectual and religious life, from eschatology to the meaning of existence. Drawing on a diverse and eclectic range of sources, from poems and vision-literature to confessors' handbooks and biblical commentaries, this course will allow students who are already familiar with some aspects of medieval life and culture to enrich their sense of the intellectual and religious dynamics of the period.  But in its broadest sense, the course is also an opportunity to think about how we, as historians, respond to ideas from past societies which are fundamentally different to our own; and in that sense, it is hoped that students with little prior experience of medieval history may also find it stimulating to explore the ways that philosophical and theological questions were pursued during this formative period in European history.",

    "course_description": "This course investigates a wide range of imperial locations and moments - spanning mid-17th century Barbados to mid-20th century India - in search of the practices, values and organizing principles which define British imperialism across time and space. In its pursuit of these characteristics, the course will seek to answer the following questions: was it the case, as some historians have claimed, that the British Empire, even at its early-20th century height, was less a single, coherent entity than a collection of unrelated, and often contradictory, local projects? Was the empire acquired, as J.R. Seeley famously claimed, in a 'fit of absence of mind', or was its development carefully nurtured and directed by interested parties located in the metropole? Was empire-building a consequence or a cause of British economic and geo-political strength? Finally, how did a nation so thoroughly saturated in the culture of liberalism came to develop such an authoritarian and autocratic empire?Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

The background, nature and effects of this interaction are considered for a number of states between Egypt and the Aegean, as well as the reasons behind the eventual collapse of this system.",
    "course_description": "This course examines the motivation and practicalities behind the intensive interaction between state-level societies in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Late Bronze Age. Geographically, the focus will range from Egypt, the Levant, Anatolia to the mainland Aegean and Crete. The course considers the different manifestations of palace-centred urban societies in this area which developed along different trajectories and with various degrees of contact among each other. By the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1400-1200 BC), in all of these societies, access to exotic information, goods, iconography and sometimes even human beings and their skills played an important role in establishment and legitimation of social elites.The evidence considered stems primarily from the excavation of settlement sites and ship wrecks, monumental artwork, iconography, distribution of artefacts and textual sources such as diplomatic correspondence. Questions and debates about state formation, economical organisation, modes of interaction and trade, and different forms of governance, ideology and religion are of particular importance, as well as the influence of technological innovations and geographical factors.This course is meant to be of interest for students who wish to learn more about early Near Eastern and Mediterranean civilisations, the development and interaction of urban, state-level societies in the Old World, and their material and textual legacy. Weekly topics include: Politics and policy in the exploration of the Eastern Mediterranean; problems at the interface between textual information and the archaeological record, diplomacy and trade in the Ancient Near East, Egypt and the Amarna Letters, Minoan-style frescoes in the Eastern Mediterranean, the archaeology of the Levantine city-states, the palatial period on Minoan Crete, the Greek mainland, Western Anatolia between Mycenaean and Hittite interests, the Hittite Empire, and the collapse of the Late Bronze Age palace societiesThe course consists of weekly two-hour class meetings with lectures, presentations and group discussions. There will also be a series of one-hour meetings focussing on specific readings aimed to highlight important disputes, concepts or problems in Eastern Mediterranean studies.",

    "summary": "Byzantium was a unique state located between the new, dynamic Islamic world and the early medieval kingdoms of continental Europe. The study of Byzantium raises issues relevant for understanding of current politics across the eastern Mediterranean and the significance of images and belief in the medieval and the modern worlds.",
    "course_description": "This course aims to understand the end of the Classical world and the emergence of new and diverse material cultures, institutions and ideologies in the Byzantine empire and its neighbours including modern Turkey, Greece, the Black Sea and south Italy. Established patterns of urbanism declined and the early medieval period saw a radical realignment in the economic, social and political structures of Europe, the Mediterranean and western Asia. From the late sixth century the empire faced new challenges including invasions by the Slavs, Bulgars and other barbarians in the Balkans and Greece.We will begin by considering Justinian's empire and in particular by reviewing the recent debate on the end of urbanism in late antiquity as well as the contribution of environmental and climate studies as a key for understanding many of these transitions. We will consider the impact that the Arab invasions had on the Byzantine world by land and sea; in particular, on urbanism, religious art and architecture and on trade in the eastern Mediterranean provinces. The course requires students to engage with both written and material evidence, including the study of monumental architecture, maritime archaeology, pottery and coins.",

In addition to tracing changes in the production, exhibition, and reception of films, broader forces shaping the industry, from State support, to censorship, and audience preferences are also examined. Attention is also given to the emergence of non-commercial cinematic forms, including documentary film. Particular emphasis will be given to introducing students to a range of primary sources for analysing film and cinema history, including collections at the National Library of Scotland, the National Archives of Scotland, and the rich documentation available at the Scottish Screen Archive. In the case of the latter, the opportunity also exists to study its extensive collection of moving images.Weekly Topics:Introduction: Approaches to Film and Cinema History.Early Days: From Fairground to Picture House.A Mature Industry: The Silent Era.British Cinema under the Quota: the 1930s.The Cinema Audience.Censorship.Our Cinema-Made Children.The Documentary Movement.Cinema in Wartime.Star Gazing: Movie Stars and Fan Culture.National Cinemas: Britain, Scotland and Wales.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

Going beyond the overwhelming focus on 'Bollywood', it examines the diversity of South Asian cinematic cultures. Through an interdisciplinary perspective that utilises films and literary sources, it  highlights theoretical and methodological concerns about history and cinema in a postcolonial, transnational context.",
    "course_description": "This course explores the making of modern South Asia through the lens of cinema. It examines not just the ways in which cinema mirrors society, but calls on students to think of South Asian cinema itself as politics, as postcoloniality, as modernity, and indeed, as social revolution. It does so through two key points of focus: first, the course goes beyond the overwhelming focus on 'Bollywood', the mainstream Hindi film industry, to highlight the linguistic and regional diversity of South Asian cinematic cultures. Second, even as it provides a chronological history of cinema in postcolonial South Asia, the course is concerned with tracing the hierarchies of caste, class, gender, religion and language that continue to define the role and form of cinema and society.Each week is structured around a set of films and aided by literary and academic sources that facilitate discussion about a number of diverse themes including the trauma and afterlives of Partition, the experiences of the South Asian diaspora, the question of 'national' and global cinema, the intertwining of cinema and Dravidian politics, the rise of Dalit cinema, and the cinematic gaze over Kashmir/Tibet as a 'territory of desire'. In addition to the focus on cinema, we will also pay attention to documentaries and television dramas. This course therefore examines postcolonial South Asia through a critical, bottom-up approach that views cinema as both subject and archive.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: this course includes topics relating to sexual, caste and religious violence.

    "course_description": "Statues and reliefs in marble and bronze were a pervasive presence in the landscape of ancient Greek cities. They stood in private and public spaces alike and are among the most enduring legacies of ancient Greece. Free-standing statues dotted civic centres; architectural sculpture decorated major monuments; and sculpted stone slabs were erected on top of burials, therefore shaping interactions with the gods, the living, and the dead.The aim of this course is to explore the styles, iconography, materials, and functions of Greek sculpture in their original contexts covering topics such as the development of bronze as a large-scale medium, the revolution in seeing and representing known as the 'classical style', Greek funerary sculpture and portraiture, the 'statuescape' of the main Greek sanctuaries and the uses of Greek sculptural motives by non-Greek Eastern dynasts in the fourth century BC.Questions to explore include: What purpose did sculpture serve in ancient cities? How were these works, small and large, bronze and marble, produced? How were they seen and understood in their original contexts? How does their form, material and iconography reflect their function? Which themes got represented in sculptural form? What can we learn about the classical world from the study of Greek sculpture?",

Although the focus will be on Attic vases, i.e., those produced in Athens, the course will also examine vessels from elsewhere in the Greek world, including Laconia, Asia Minor, the islands, and South Italy. Questions of interest include: why do certain images appear on certain vessels in particular contexts? How do different painters represent a given myth and why? What are \"genre\" scenes in Greek vase painting, and how do they function? What does repetition on a given vase mean? What is the relationship between Greek vase painting and other ancient media, including metalware and monumental wall painting? How does the portable and three-dimensional nature of vases affect their imagery? What is the relationship between text, both on and off the vase, and image? How can vases illuminate our knowledge of the role of the artist and patron, Greek religion, perceptions of gender roles and sexuality, social hierarchy, and politics? Readings include both ancient authors and modern scholarship.",

Using written and material evidence from the ancient world and its interpretation by modern scholars, the course is thematically organized around various topics. The time in Greece will be spent visiting the material remains - sites, monuments, and museum collections - of this region.

Focusing on Britain since the Second World War, it examines a range of themes. These includes the ambitions and record of the post-war Attlee government; the reasons why successive governments failed to achieve economic stability and prosperity; the success of the Conservative party between 1951 and 1964; the apparent 'failure' of the government of Harold Wilson; the crisis of the 1970s; and the rise, record and legacy of Margaret Thatcher. Conceptually, students will assess whether there was a post-war 'consensus' between the parties on key aspects of public policy, as well as the imperatives of a democratic political system.Content note: This course will expose students to a considerable variety of approaches in the field of political history. Students taking the course need to be prepared to engage with historical actors on their own terms and grapple with ideas and movements with which they may personally disagree. Engaging with a diverse range of viewpoints is integral to the study of History at a university.

    "summary": "This course offers an investigation of a central topic in twentieth-century U.S. political history: the development of conservatism from the New Deal to the Reagan years. As well as analysing the activities of the Republican Party in power and in pursuit of power, the course explores the development of conservative ideas and of conservative movements over time.",
    "course_description": "In 1994, Alan Brinkley observed that historians of the United States during the twentieth century had largely failed to explain the strength of conservative politics, generally choosing to focus instead on liberals and liberalism. Over the past decade, this literature has undergone a significant transformation, as historians have tackled many of the oversights identified by Brinkley and have pursued other research questions as well. This course encourages students to explore the historiography of modern American conservatism and to engage with key debates within this literature. The course investigates the modern history of conservative ideas in the United States, the strategies of conservative politicians in pursuit of power and their actions once they won power, and the development of movements that sought to mobilise grass-roots support for conservative ideas. Among the themes under consideration are the nature of conservatism in the American South and the emergence of the Republican party there. The most intensely contested debate that the course analyses involves the reasons for the decline of liberalism and the rise of conservatism from the 1960s onwards. The course will explores methodologies and approaches taken by scholars - including not only historians but also those working within other disciplines, notably that of political science - to their investigations of the subject. It also explores the nature of the primary material available to historians in studying different aspects of the subject.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: racist ideas and actions, sexist ideas and actions. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "summary": "Constantinople - variously hailed as the 'New Rome', the 'New Jerusalem', the 'Queen of Cities' - was the largest and most splendid city of medieval Christendom into the early thirteenth century, visualised by the majestic dome of the city's main church, Emperor Justinian's Church of the Holy Wisdom, Hagia Sophia. While the city had been besieged many times previously, its massive walls were only breached for the first time in 1204, when the Crusaders conquered the Byzantine capital for half a century, and then again, for a final time, in 1453, when its fall equalled the ultimate collapse of the long-living Eastern Roman / Byzantine empire. This course traces the four life cycles of this medieval megalopolis, from Constantine and Justinian's late antique city via its middle (c. 750 - 1204) and late Byzantine (1261 - 1453) incarnations to the Ottoman city. It introduces participants to both textual and material sources. All source texts will be read in English translation.",
    "course_description": "This course aspires students to the history of one of history's most important cities: Byzantium, renamed Constantinople after its refounder, Constantine I, 'the Great', that first Christian emperor, and nowadays known as Istanbul (from Greek eis ten polin), the Turkish capital on the Bosphorus and Sea of Marmara. While it will explore the imperial transition from the Byzantines to the Ottomans over the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, for its main part it shall highlight various aspects in the life of the Byzantine city: from politics and spiritual life - Constantinople housed an enormous number of churches, monasteries, and certainly the largest and holiest relic collection in the world prior to 1204 - via cultural life and schools to more practical issues, such as provisioning this medieval megalopolis (= 'mega-city') with water, grain, vegetables, and meat.1.

These were the years when Britain's economy began to descend from the heights of world pre-eminence, when social change again intensified into class antagonism, when the union came under unprecedented pressure, and when Victorian confidence began to sour into uncertainty and anxiety. This course examines these changes and the debates that they occasioned.",
    "course_description": "Between 1870 and 1900, the mood of expansive confidence and equipoise characteristic of the mid-Victorian period was replaced with one of anxiety and concern for the future. From the late 1860s, British economic growth began to falter, and rival economies started to catch up and even pull ahead. Against this backdrop of 'relative decline', publicity of urban poverty and the disorienting effects of rapid urbanization convinced many that the nation had lost its way. How did the late-Victorians understand the changes taking place around them? Were all late-Victorians afflicted by a sense of crisis and decline, or did some embrace and even benefit from rapid change?This course runs the gamut of late-Victorian politics, society, culture and economy, and asks whether the final three decades of the 19th century comprise a discrete historical period with its own unique 'spirit' and character. Students will examine a range of materials to gain an understanding of how the late-Victorians understood their place in the world, their relationship to the British past, and their role in building the future.",

Adapted from a republican institution by Augustus, it was in essence the personal army of the emperor and within a very short time was also responsible for specialised military tasks and for various administrative duties in Rome, such as policing the games. This course will examine the praetorian guard from its establishment to its demise in 312 CE, considering aspects as diverse as the physical make-up of the unit and the political influence that it had in Rome.",
    "course_description": "This course will consider the development of the praetorian guard by the first emperor Augustus and, in particular, why there was a need for such a unit in the principate. Despite the prominence of the guard in modern presentations of imperial Rome, finding specific information about them is challenging, since the ancient literary sources did not often discuss the unit and when they did, it was inevitably to malign either the guard or the emperor. There is a dearth of material evidence as well until into the second century CE. Students will therefore be challenged to interpret what little we have remaining in an attempt to determine the numbers of soldiers, how they looked and what they did. Such a study will provide students with an idea of the difficulty of understanding the ways in which those who wielded absolute power in the Roman Empire maintained that power for several centuries.",

    "course_description": "The lived experience of a peasant working on the field and of a high official belonging to the royal entourage differed widely from each other. For the latter, there is an abundance of written and pictorial sources: there are for example texts discussing the appropriate behaviour in the royal court and tomb scenes showing the tomb owner at a banquette or fulfilling his official duties.  Elite tombs may also contain idealized depictions of peasants engaged in agricultural work or craftsmen producing various goods. Such scenes carry important information on some of the technical aspect of ancient Egyptian agriculture and craftmanship, but to reconstruct the day-to-day experience of commoners in the second half of the 2nd millennium BCE, a critical reading of the Egyptian literary sources as well as the study of the excavated settlements, e.g. Deir el-Medina, Amarna, Pi-Ramesse or Elephantine is essential.In this course we will work with the archaeological material, the pictorial representations as well as with written sources that we will read in translation. Students will have the opportunity to enhance their skills of critically engaging with ancient sources the original language of which they might not command. We will discuss topics such as the ancient Egyptian conception of family life and kinship, domestic and urban architecture, integration and/or segregation of people with physical disabilities and mental health conditions, medicine and magic, justice system and criminal punishment or physical as well as social mobility. These discussions will allow students to reflect on the complex relationship between the individual and the society in ancient and modern times, on the different strategies of how a community integrates those living on the fringes, and on the differences between ancient and modern gender roles.",

It will familiarise students with the archaeological evidence (contexts incl. grave goods, images, topography) and offer insights into theoretical and methodological approaches and current academic debates.",
    "course_description": "This course is designed to familiarise students with a variety of preserved burial contexts as well as the associated material culture (e.g. images, monuments and artefacts). We will examine a representative range of the considerable corpus of archaeological evidence for Greek burial customs from the Geometric to Early Hellenistic periods.The course will cover not only the way in which humans buried humans but also what this can tell us about the Greek society during different historical periods and in different parts of the Greek World. Students will gain a deeper insight into the variety of grave types, rituals and associated objects and will be encouraged to use this knowledge to discuss theoretical and methodological approaches on how to interpret them. In-class discussion and in-class presentation will further enhance students' ability to evaluate and communicate diverging opinions of academic debates, as well as to develop their own viewpoints.",

    "summary": "This course examines how and why ideals and practices of marriage in later Roman and post-Roman societies shifted between c.400 and c.1000. Focussing on a range of primary sources, students will gain a detailed understanding of how marriage was contested, disputed and transformed in this period, and will carefully examine the social, political and religious contexts of these developments. Students will also critically examine strikingly different ways in which historians have debated the evolution of marriage, gender, family and kinship within grand narratives of the transition from antiquity to the middle ages.",
    "course_description": "In the fifth century a pope presented with a tricky marriage dispute could take it for granted that slaves could not marry. In a society deeply shaped by Roman law, married slaves were legally unintelligible. Fast forward to the ninth century and bishops were cautiously protecting the rights of unfree people to marry (so long as their masters consented). Something was shifting. The slow emergence of unfree marriage as a legal and social possibility is one facet of the broader evolution of marriage across late antiquity and the early middle ages. This course examines the history of marriage and related topics, including gender, family and kinship, in western Europe between c.400 and c.1000. Students will root important changes and continuities in ideals and practices of marriage in the shifting social, religious and political landscape of the post-Roman world. Drawing on a range of primary sources, students will closely examine how the place of marriage in church, royal courts and wider society was vigorously debated; and critically examine historiographical debates over the significance of marriage, gender, family and kinship in understanding the transition from antiquity to the middle ages.The opening weeks introduce three tectonic plates in the history of medieval marriage: legal regulations and social norms in classical and late Roman society; tense debates over the place of marriage within late antique Christianity; and 'Germanic' or 'barbarian' customs surrounding marriage and kinship.Thereafter, subsequent seminars explore the new configurations created - and, sometimes, the friction generated - as these tectonic plates shifted in post-Roman societies. Key themes include: legal regulations in theory and social norms in practice; marriage, gender and sexuality in pastoral practice; married sexuality, sanctity and lay piety; clerical marriage; incest regulations and spiritual kinship (godparenthood); royal/aristocratic marriage disputes and the politics of sexuality; marriage and social status.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: sexual violence, sexual abuse, prostitution. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

Many countries and regions were shaped in some way by Irish settlement, and Irish migration was a defining feature of the history of Ireland since the early modern period with over 10 million leaving the island. This course seeks to evaluate the vast historiography of the global Irish by examining the diverse experiences of the Irish diaspora in a variety of national and regional contexts.

    "summary": "This aim of this core course is to introduce students to a range of important theoretical perspectives and issues from within both economic and social theory and heighten awareness of the diversity of approaches  to the study of human behaviour within the social sciences.",
    "course_description": "Awareness of the diversity of methods within the social sciences is promoted to encourage an open and interdisciplinary approach to historical research and to stimulate an interest in exploring different theories and traditions within students' own research themes. The theoretical areas for detailed examination are chosen because they highlight this diversity of approach and because some understanding is likely to be of relevance to a wide range of research themes. Topics vary from year to year but are likely to include approaches to economic growth and technological change; social class and social identity; anthropological approaches to material culture; the application of Malthusian ideas to historical demography; the new institutional economics; social capital.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: colonialism, enslaved labour, forced labour, exploitation, and sexual violence. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "summary": "During the New Kingdom (1550-1067 BCE), pharaonic Egypt reached its greatest extent, having expanded its borders both to Nubian territories in the south and to the Levant in the northeast. In this course we will discuss the different ways in which the Egyptians maintained control in these areas, to which degree the Egyptian presence influenced the local traditions and vica versa, what impact these encounters had on the Egyptian culture itself.",
    "course_description": "While the ideology, and also the logistics behind the Egyptian military campaigns to the Levantine region and Nubia showed many similarities, the methods of maintaining control over these areas were markedly different. Nubia, parts of which was already under Egyptian control before the New Kingdom, became under direct Egyptian rule during this period. The Egyptian control in the Levant was upheld through the establishment of garrison towns as well as with a complex alliance system with local rulers. These different Egyptian approaches resulting from different geopolitical factors had an effect on the degree of interactions between locals and resident Egyptians. Through the presentation of various case studies, such as the garrison town Beth Shean in the Levant, or the settlement of Tombos in Nubia, we will discuss the interactions between local populations and the representatives of the Egyptian states, whether and how Egyptian concepts influenced local religious and artistic traditions and vice versa, and what were the long term effects (if any) of the Egyptian dominance in these regions.This course will allow students to become familiar with the foreign relations of pharaonic Egypt in the 2nd millennium BCE, and the archaeology of selected archaeological sites in Nubia (modern Sudan) and of the Levante (modern Israel, Jordan and Lebanon). The participants will become aware of the challenges while reconstructing ethnic and cultural identities of past societies and also will also reflect our modern biases while discussing the methods of imperialism of an ancient empire.",

    "summary": "This course provides a study of developments in British foreign policy, from the last years of the Victorian Era to the signing of the Treaty of Locarno in 1925. It focuses in particular on the policy of British governments, giving an historical analysis of the main developments in their relationship with Europe and the wider world, such as the making of the ententes, diplomacy during the Great War, the origins of the policy of appeasement and relations with other great powers.",
    "course_description": "In the late nineteenth century and for much of the twentieth century, Britain was simultaneously a European, American, Asiatic and African power. The purpose of this course is to examine the ways in which British policy-makers manipulated their foreign and defence policies to maintain Britain's overseas interests, with a particular focus on European affairs. The chronological period covered by the course includes the time when Britain was at the height of its global power and the period when its position was coming under so much stress that policy makers were compelled to shed an increasing proportion of their overseas commitments. The topics that will be examined will include: the composition and ideas of the policy-making elite in Britain; the influence of the Treasury - and more generally of economic constraints - on foreign and defence policy; the invasions of Afghanistan and Egypt in 1878 and 1882 and their significance; the governance of the British empire in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; the decision to rebuff German advances for an alliance but to negotiate an alliance with Japan and ententes with France and Russia at around the turn of the century; the development of war aims during the First World War; the Lloyd Georgian revolution in British Government; the British response to the Bolshevik Revolution; the problems facing the British when they tried to disengage from Europe in the 1920s.The focus of this course is predominantly on high-level policymaking in the diplomatic, military and economic realms, but it will all give attention to shifts in popular attitudes, parliamentary debates, the influence of electoral considerations, and the larger-scale transitions taking place in the international system. It also discusses the wider background factors which influenced British policy and touches on such diverse factors as Imperial defence, financial limitations and the influence of public opinion. In common with other graduate courses, it will include study and discussion of primary sources throughout.",

    "course_description": "The course examines the development of Etruscan society, one of the first urban civilizations in western Europe, from a formative stage in the Early Iron Age through the growth and expansion of city states (7th-5th centuries BC), urban life, and the subsequent transformation associated with the expansion of Rome in the 4th-3rd centuries BC. A range of evidence is considered, primarily from archaeological sites, with an emphasis on funerary as well as residential contexts, inscriptions and 'art' (notably tomb paintings).  Themes of particular interest include social organisation (using funerary data), state formation, urbanisation, social identities, trade and interaction (both within the Mediterranean and with central Europe).The course is designed for those with a special interest in early civilizations, the ancient Mediterranean world, and ancient art. Major topics for discussion on a weekly basis are: Early Iron Age settlements; Burials and funerary rituals, 950-700 BC; The rise of the city state (8th-7th centuries BC) and the Orientalizing phenomenon; Etruscan settlements in the 7th-6th centuries BC; Urbanisation; The Etruscans and their neighbours (Greeks, Phoenicians, Celts): trade, interaction and mobility;  Trade, harbours and sanctuaries; Towns and town planning in the 6th-5th centuries BC; Iconography and ideology: funerary traditions and tomb painting in the 6th-5th century BC; Etruria in the Hellenistic period (4th-2nd centuries BC).The course is especially concerned with:  how different types of evidence (archaeological, textual, numismatic, etc.) can be used to illuminate aspects of the period; controversies and hypotheses surrounding the processes of change during this period, with specific reference to the increasing complexity of funerary evidence, changes in settlement patterns and in the character of residential sites; the applicability of general theoretical models and methodologies in elucidating such questions as the formation of a state; the way in which different research traditions and approaches, past and present, may impact on reconstruction; the place and significance of Etruscan civilisation within the broader setting of the western European Iron Age and the transition from 'prehistory' to 'history'.The course comprises eleven class meetings (22 contact hours) and is equivalent to 20 credits. Classes consist of single sessions, separated by a 5-minute interval, usually incorporating shortish lectures (20-40 minutes), discussion sessions (10-20 minutes) and some group-based collaborative work.",

We will study how early modern people forged an Atlantic economy based on the attempted commodification of African captives, the expropriation of Indigenous resources, and the invention of new legal cultures that supported plantation systems. The course begins with core historiographical frameworks of the Atlantic world, and then moves into the study of three sites - sixteenth- to seventeenth-century Ireland, Barbados, and the Gold Coast of West Africa - before concluding with scholarly criticisms of Atlantic approaches and a comparison with global history methods.",

    "summary": "The transatlantic slave trade wrought the early modern Atlantic world, connecting West and West Central Africa, Western Europe, and the Americas in a web of trade, diplomacy, cultural clash and assimilation, labour exploitation, and resource extraction. From this often coercive dynamic, people generated diverse and lasting articulations of the nature and need for freedom. This course considers the practices, processes, and ideas that built the early Atlantic world, with a particular focus on the sites of sixteenth- to seventeenth-century Ireland, Barbados, and the Gold Coast of West Africa.",
    "course_description": "In this course, students will learn key concepts for the study of the early modern Atlantic world. Our focus will be on the foundational themes of Atlantic history: freedom and coercion. We will study how early modern people forged an Atlantic economy based on the attempted commodification of African captives, the expropriation of Indigenous resources, and the invention of new legal cultures that supported plantation systems. The course begins with core historiographical frameworks of the Atlantic world, and then moves into the study of three sites - sixteenth- to seventeenth-century Ireland, Barbados, and the Gold Coast of West Africa - before concluding with scholarly criticisms of Atlantic approaches and a comparison with global history methods.",

The course also involves some practical hands-on sessions (teaching collection, lab and museum visit). There is an emphasis on the analysis of archaeological data (e.g. excavations, surveys, artefacts, ecofacts) and on conceptual building blocks in archaeology (e.g. chronology, time, formation processes, field survey, trade and interaction, artefact analysis), supplemented in some weeks by selected theoretical perspectives (aspects of social archaeology, identity).",

The course complements the more explicitly theoretical basis of the MSc/Diploma course, Theoretical Archaeology, and is also intended to ensure that all candidates, regardless of prior knowledge and experience, are well acquainted with the 'nuts and bolts' of archaeological practice and methods. Coverage is fairly broad and so it is important that students read as widely and intensively as possible as the course progresses. At the same time, discussion of the prescribed themes is expected to extend well beyond the introductory level and to explore a range of applications and theoretical implications. You are also encouraged to consider and discuss the potential relevance of these themes to specific case studies or potential research topics in which you have a particular interest.",

Moving between pre-colonial, colonial and contemporary times, the course examines the continuities and changes in gender relations in the context of the variety of economic, social and cultural systems which developed in the European colonial empires. Following the examination of the impact of 'empire' (in the widest use of the term) on the formation of European consciousness and political practices, the course analyses the extent to which these policies affected gender relations by examining particular cases studies in specific geographical contexts (primarily Africa and India).  It chiefly looks at the main transformation of gender relations throughout the colonial and post-colonial periods, although attention will be also given to the features of the relationship between men and women in pre-colonial contexts.  Topics include: the impact of imperial possessions on both literature and on masculinities and femininities, pre-colonial patterns of gender relations in Africa and India, the impact of colonial policies on the status of men and women and different forms of resistance against, collaboration with and adaptation to imperial policies and cultural models.",

    "summary": "The course aims to examine the ways in which ideas about gender, sexuality and citizenship informed definitions of criminality and deviancy in Scotland and England in the late-nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It explores a set of key debates concerning the nature of regulation in the modern state as well as focusing on specific examples - the policing of juvenile delinquency, homosexuality and prostitution - in order to examine the relationship between expert opinion, popular culture, social policy and social action. A range of textual and visual artefacts are examined - including film, photography, fiction, autobiography and the popular press - to consider the significance of criminal narratives in the shaping of gendered, sexual and national identities.",
    "course_description": "Since the emergence of a specific 'social history of crime' in the 1960s, historians have argued that study of the regulation of marginal, deviant and criminal behaviours is central to our understanding of modern societies. An earlier interest in class as a category of analysis has been joined by work on gender, sexuality, age and ethnicity as markers of social identity. Similarly, quantitative research on patterns of prosecution has been complemented by studies that examine the representation of criminal and deviant behaviour within both popular culture and expert discourse. Thus the historical study of criminality provides a rich subject area through which a range of theoretical and methodological debates may be explored. This course examines the gendering of offending behaviour, penal policy, surveillance strategies and popular representations of criminality in Scotland and England c. 1860-1960. The study will be contextualised in relation to state concerns about national strength and citizenship as well as a dominant belief in penal-welfarism. Whilst focusing on the study of Scotland and England (and therefore acknowledging the differing legal systems of Scotland and England/Wales) the course may also draw on comparative studies of Europe and North America.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: crime, violence (including gender-based), policing, punishment, sexuality. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

The cases are chosen from the record of contemporary history - all come from the post-1914 period and all bar one from after the beginning of the Second World War. Students will emerge from the course being able to think comparatively and conceptually about genocide as well as about individual cases of it and connections between different cases. They will interrogate the utility and problems of the very concept itself. They will also study responses to genocide in the form of 'humanitarian intervention' and war crimes trials.

    "summary": "This course considers genocide in the contemporary world. Though taught by an historian, and with an historical approach predominating, it also draws on concepts and themes from political science, anthropology and law, in examining the causes and character of a range of genocides, as well responses to genocide.",
    "course_description": "This course seeks to establish an historical understanding of genocide, informed by the theoretical and multi-disciplinary approaches that have so shaped the field of genocide studies. The cases are chosen from the record of contemporary history - all come from the post-1914 period and all bar one from after the beginning of the Second World War. Students will emerge from the course being able to think comparatively and conceptually about genocide as well as about individual cases of it and connections between different cases. They will interrogate the utility and problems of the very concept itself. They will also study responses to genocide in the form of 'humanitarian intervention' and war crimes trials. The cases will be drawn from across the world: Asia, Africa, Europe, the Americas and Australasia, with perpetrators ranging from imperialist powers to fascists, communists, nation-state builders, 'developmentalists' and counter-insurgency fighters, and 'enablers' ranging from structural features of the international political economy to regional and world powers and the contours of the Cold War.",

New philosophical approaches generated fierce debates among academics and scientists, theologians and politicians. Thus this course introduces students to some central developments in European cultural life.",
    "course_description": "The course begins by assessing the nature of scholastic thought in early modern Europe, before surveying four overlapping processes of intellectual experimentation. First, it examines the revival of ancient atomistic thought, and the emergence of related mechanical philosophies. Second, the course discusses Descartes' innovative 'first philosophy', and engages with the lively controversies over his works' religious consequences. Third, the course turns to Locke's philosophy of knowledge, its critics and followers. The course concludes with the debates inspired by Newton's natural philosophy, which had considerable impact in the Enlightenment. Students will read extracts from works by thinkers including Descartes, Locke, Spinoza and Newton, and draw on a rich secondary literature to locate these texts in context. There will be a particular focus on Scottish evidence. The course complements other options taught in the School in intellectual history, the history of science and the Scottish Enlightenment.",

    "summary": "The course provides postgraduate students with a close study of the art and archaeology of the Greek world from c. 323-31 B.C. considered in its political, religious, and social context. Of special interest are the development and political manipulation of ruler portraiture, the manifold use of styles, including the rise of the Hellenistic baroque style, wall painting, and interactions with non-Greek cultures (including the Romans), which produced a hybrid art in response to new concerns.",
    "course_description": "This course focuses on the art and archaeology of the Mediterranean and its surrounding regions between c. 323 and 31 BC. In the East this was a period dominated by the newly-established Hellenistic kingdoms that followed in the wake of Alexander's conquests, one which saw the old cities of Greece and Asia Minor increasingly adapt in the face of a new political reality and large numbers of non-Greeks come under Greek-Macedonian control for the first time. In the West, this was the period in which Rome first emerged as a superpower, establishing its influence in Italy and then coming into direct contact with both the Hellenistic kingdoms of the East and Carthage. Visual and material culture survives from this period in abundance and this course concentrates on what this evidence reveals about the changing cultural, political, religious and social priorities of individuals and communities across this timeframe, from as far apart as Afghanistan and Spain. Particular themes that will be explored include the new visual language of royal imagery established by Alexander and his successors, the interaction between Greeks and non-Greeks, the development of wall-painting and mosaic art, the role of honorific statuary in Greek civic contexts, the emergence of the so-called Baroque style of Hellenistic art, the impact of Greek culture in Italy, and the Hellenistic economies.",

    "summary": "Herod ruled Judea, on traditional dating, from 40 - 4 BCE: a time of international transition. The Hellenistic era came to an end (30 BCE) in the face of Rome's supremacy, and the Roman state was itself revolutionised into the Augustan principate. So how does the king of Judaea, a territory on the periphery of Augustus' empire, fit in to this picture? This course will examine Herod's reign to elucidate the paradoxes and complexities of a monarchy that draw on Hellenistic traditions in a Jewish context under Roman rule.",
    "course_description": "The story of Herod the Great (c. 73-4 BCE) is a gripping one that can be told from various angles. One story might focus on politics: Herod came to the throne in unusual circumstances and went on to oversee the transition of the Southern Levant from Hellenisticto Roman rule, walking a thin line between obedience to Roman overlords and opposition from local stakeholders. Another story might concentrate on identity: Herod's father was an Idumean, his mother a Nabatean, and yet he became king of the Jews - an unprecedented and far from uncontroversial appointment that challenged the very notion of what it meant to be Jewish. A third story could trace reception: we are uniquely well-informed about Herod through the writings of Flavius Josephus, but these already presuppose decades of (often unfavourable) reception and reinterpretation of Herod's reign - and if Herod is famous until this day, this is largely due to his role in the Christian nativity legend. What makes the study of Herod's reign challenging is that all these stories and more are inextricably linked.Based on textual sources and an ever-growing body of material evidence, this course will examine recent trends in Herodian research through a number of case studies. The course is not biographically oriented: students are expected to familiarise themselves with the life of Herod early in the course, e.g. through reading one of the many biographies published recently. The course then highlights individual episodes (such as Herod's staging of gladiatorial games in Jerusalem), bodies of evidence (such as Herod's coins) or buildings (such as Herodium) to elucidatethe paradoxes and complexities of monarchy in a Jewish context under Roman rule. Students will learn to reflect critically on scholarly categories (what is \"Hellenistic\", \"Roman\", or \"Jewish\"?), ancient historiographical sources, and identity politics (both ancient and modern).",

Students will be made familiar with the range of online resources and databases available to them as students at the University of Edinburgh, and also how to search for further material online. It will be taught through a combination of podcast lectures, pathways, and virtual presentations. Students will be encouraged to focus on methods and materials that suit their individual research interests, which should anticipate the research required for successful completion of the MSc dissertation. Through a wide-ranging series of seminars and pathways with members of academic staff, students will develop a meaningful familiarity with the interpretative strategies and secondary materials that define major approaches in current historical scholarship.

    "summary": "This course is one of two 'core' courses on the online MSc in History.  The aim of these two courses is to prepare students to undertake their dissertations.  This course focuses on research skills and the analysis of different types of primary source.",
    "course_description": "The first core course for the taught MSc in History (online) aims to provide the technical skills and interpretive strategies to locate and assess primary historical material, particularly online. It will provide an introduction to graduate-level study in history and provide students with the opportunity to enhance their skills in historical research. Students will be made familiar with the range of online primary source databases available to them as students at the University of Edinburgh, and also how to search for further material online. Taught through a combination of podcast lectures, source-training pathways, online skills workshops and virtual presentations. Students will be encouraged to focus on those archival materials and primary source databases that suit their individual research interests, which should anticipate the research required for successful completion of the MSc dissertation. This training course will also provide instruction in critical use of online search materials, instructions on how to approach archival research, and effective use of database software. Finally the course will provide an introduction to the historical profession, including peer-review and professional modes of disseminating historical knowledge. This course complements the 'Approaches to History' core course offered in the spring semester on the online MSc in History.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, we recommend that students enrolled on this course check the pathway descriptions carefully when listing their preferences, where lecturers will outline any sensitive content likely to be discussed on their pathways. These pathway descriptions will be made available on the course Learn site by the beginning of the relevant semester.While these pathway descriptions indicate sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, they will not be exhaustive because pathway organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

The last two or three sessions (depending on student numbers) will take the form of symposia in which each student circulates the piece of writing they have been working on, presents it to the other students, and receives feedback on it from all the students in the workshop.",

    "summary": "Critical understanding of the history of historical inquiry now extends beyond the province of intellectual historians. Indeed, attempts to trace the methodological, epistemological, ideological, institutional, and stylistic trends that have characterised the theory and practice of historical scholarship now constitute a growing preoccupation for social, material, cultural, and political historians. This course examines key developments in the history of 'History', from Michelet's romantic popularisation of Vico during the 1830s, through Ranke's invention of historical disciplines during the late nineteenth century, through to the debates concerning 'the new cultural history' during the late-twentieth century.",
    "course_description": "This course will enable graduate students to engage meaningfully with key philosophical concepts, research methods, and publications that have contributed to the history of modern historical inquiry in Western Europe and North America, c.1830-1985. Using Jules Michelet's popular rediscovery of Giambattista Vico's Scienza Nuova (1725) in 1835 as a departure point, we will address the ways in which historians, who maintained a wide range of commitments (including nationalist, romantic, positivist, sociological, materialist, anthropological, structuralist, and poststructuralist commitments), made use of historical scholarship and Viconian historicism in particular to elaborate their projects. Drawing on theoretical readings and historical publications from across the West that span some 150 years, the weekly readings and discussion also will feature documentary evidence (including music and visual art) to illustrate the legacies of this past in current professional practice.  All readings will be provided in English, or in English translation.This course will comprise weekly 2-hour seminars, each of which will include a short lecture, informal student presentation, and discussion.",

This course will provide an overview on migratory processes from prehistory to the present, focusing on archaeological sources but also incorporating written evidence whenever available.",
    "course_description": "Migrations represent one of the most defining features of human history since its beginnings to the present. In recent years, archaeological research has witnessed the so-called 'third science revolution', triggered by the development of bioarchaeological methods -- especially archaeogenetics and isotopic analyses. These approaches have forced us to radically rethink mobility in the past and develop new pathways of integrating all available evidence to move beyond simple narratives of human migration. Due to its long-term perspective, archaeology is in an advantageous position to contribute to a deeper reflection on the topic, by not only counteracting isolationist narratives, but also showing the complexity of human mobility in the past and present and the challenges and opportunities it poses.This course will provide an overview on migratory processes from early prehistory ('out of Africa' in the Palaeolithic) to the 21st century. It will combine an introduction to the key definitions and theoretical perspectives on migration with the presentation of specific case studies from different periods and geographical regions. While the main emphasis will be on the material evidence of migrations, other sources, including texts, will also be incorporated whenever available. Thus, the course has a marked interdisciplinary design, and it aims to address one of the most crucial topics of our current world from a deep time perspective.",

    "course_description": "Everyone acknowledges that 'honour' is central to the societies and norms that assume centre stage in the greatest works of classical Greek literature and thought. Yet the concept -- both in its nature and in its pervasiveness in Greek society -- is often poorly understood. And this matters, because its ramifications are very wide indeed: from the quarrel that animates the plot of Europe's earliest work of literature to the motivations of tragic characters both male and female, major and minor, honour is at the heart of a complex of ethical values whose understanding is indispensable to the interpretation of Greek literature and thought. It underpins the self-assertion of heroes, but also the control that communities exert on heroic self-assertion. Such themes recur in myriad variations in a variety of contexts because honour is the central concept of Greek social and political life, from the society depicted in the Homeric poems, via the archaic societies that received those poems, to the developed democracy of classical Athens. From the Iliad to Athenian law, oratory, and politics 'honour' is inextricably linked not only with the pursuit of prestige in competition with others, but also with justice, self-control, and the interests of the community. In Homer, Sophocles, Aristotle, and the Attic orators not only does the notion of honour presuppose an implicit conception of rights, but terms linked to that notion can be explicitly used to articulate such a concept. Honour is the driving force in ancient Greek social interaction, in the norms and values that are expressed in relationships at both interpersonal and civic levels, and in the institutions that bind individuals to their communities. This is a history that starts with literary sources but which reaches deep into ancient Greek society. It is the history that this course aims to explore.",

And this matters, because its ramifications are very wide indeed: from the quarrel that animates the plot of Europe's earliest work of literature to the motivations of tragic characters both male and female, major and minor, honour is at the heart of a complex of ethical values whose understanding is indispensable to the interpretation of Greek literature and thought. It underpins the self-assertion of heroes, but also the control that communities exert on heroic self-assertion. Such themes recur in myriad variations in a variety of contexts because honour is the central concept of Greek social and political life, from the society depicted in the Homeric poems, via the archaic societies that received those poems, to the developed democracy of classical Athens. From the Iliad to Athenian law, oratory, and politics 'honour' is inextricably linked not only with the pursuit of prestige in competition with others, but also with justice, self-control, and the interests of the community. In Homer, Sophocles, Aristotle, and the Attic orators not only does the notion of honour presuppose an implicit conception of rights, but terms linked to that notion can be explicitly used to articulate such a concept. Honour is the driving force in ancient Greek social interaction, in the norms and values that are expressed in relationships at both interpersonal and civic levels, and in the institutions that bind individuals to their communities. This is a history that starts with literary sources but which reaches deep into ancient Greek society. It is the history that this course aims to explore.",

In view of the ongoing crisis between Russia and Ukraine, this course also seeks toprovide an examination of the longer-term trends in Russian and Post-Soviet Politics as they affect the other states of the former Soviet Union. While concentrating on Russia, the course aims to provide students with a profound knowledge and ability to analyse the politics and foreign policies of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation, Ukraine, the Baltic States and the other post-Soviet countries. The first half of this course will examine the emergence, transformation and development of the Soviet Union as traced from the collapse of the tsarist state, the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917, via the period of Stalin's dictatorship and the leaderships of Khrushchev and Brezhnev, up to the end of the Gorbachev era which culminated in the dissolution of the Union in 1991. It will focus on the key features of 'really existing socialism' and explore conceptualisations such as totalitarianism. After briefly examining the reasons for the introduction of glasnost and perestroika and the relationship between these and the collapse of the USSR, the course proceeds to examine the political system of the Russian Federation as it developed from 1991 onwards under Presidents Boris Eltsin, Vladimir Putin, Dmitrii Medvedev and Putin again from 2012. The course will conclude with an examination of the process of the rise of authoritarianism under Putin. This course will integrate methodology and approaches from both History and Politics.",

    "course_description": "This course considers the intellectual history of the American Revolution (c. 1763-1791). Owing to wealth of pamphlets, letters, and other primary sources that have survived from the period, the American Revolution provides a unique study opportunity.  Among the themes to be considered are the ideological origins of the revolution; the Declaration of Independence; the debate over republicanism; constitution-making at the state and federal levels; the meaning of citizenship, including the place of women, slaves, Native Americans in the new republican polity; concepts of representation; the origin of the Bill of Rights; and the development of religious freedom. The revolution will be considered in the context of broader transatlantic intellectual, political and cultural developments. The course will also consider the American Revolution as a subject within intellectual history through a close reading of primary and secondary sources.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: enslavement, Indigenous displacement. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

The course consists of reading and language classes with linguistically based tutorials on subjects including prose composition and metre.  The aim is to improve the Latin skills of those intending to undertake doctoral research in Edinburgh or elsewhere.",
    "course_description": "This is essentially a reading class with the aim of improving the linguistic ability of the students. The course typically examines two set texts in the semester.  Two classes each week are devoted to reading and language, the third is a lecture on a subject or an aspect of the text.  In addition, there is a linguistically based tutorial once a week for subjects such as grammar study, unseen translation, prose composition and metre.  While the course focuses mainly on linguistic improvement, the students will also study the literary, historical and intellectual relevance of the texts and become acquainted with current scholarship on the subject.",

    "course_description": "This core course for the taught MSc programme in Contemporary History provides a general introduction to the advanced study of contemporary history and to some of the particular challenges posed by it. The course combines two elements. First, there are thematic sessions on broad, trans-national topics that are particularly relevant to contemporary history and that have generated debate in the relevant historiography, such as 'conflict, peace and reconciliation' or 'globalization, nationalism and transnationalism'. The second set of sessions addresses methodological issues that are particularly relevant to the study of contemporary history, including the potential and pitfalls of such uniquely contemporary material as online sources, oral history, film and sound documents.The ultimate objective is to discuss the differences and similarities between contemporary history, other fields of history on the one hand and cognate disciplines, particularly those in the social sciences, on the other.The course is team-taught by a group of colleagues working in the field of contemporary history. Therefore, the precise content of the sessions may vary from year to year, based on staff availability and research expertise, but the course's broad outlines and objectives remain the same.",

    "summary": "The subject matter of the course complements that of others currently offered in Archaeology. It is an additional course, not a replacement. The course investigates island cultures and societies both in their own right, as independent entities, and with reference to adjacent landmasses in the ancient Mediterranean. The main case studies are drawn from Malta, Sicily, the Aeolian archipelago, Pantelleria, Corsica, Sardinia and the Balearics. Major themes for discussion are the earliest human colonisation of islands, and periods of conspicuous cultural development or florescence (including the temple period on Malta, the Nuraghic and Talayotic phases in Sardinia and the Balearics, the Late Bronze Age in Sicily). Particular attention is paid to explanations for cultural change in the light of theoretical propositions and debates about island worlds as specific and potentially divergent entities with distinct identities, or laboratories of cultural change, variously stimulated by isolation or contact. Attention is also paid to human interaction with particular landscapes and ecosystems, often of a fragile character.",

It encompasses a time of huge variation, which includes a key period of Egyptian foreign expansion during the New Kingdom, but is bounded on both sides by periods of great foreign presence and impact on the country's rule. It will include up to date and ongoing research into key issues relevant to study of this period, as well as providing a good grounding in aspects of daily life for commoners as well as the elite and royalty. Textual sources in translation will be consulted to provide insights into the economy and administration of the New Kingdom, given the rich corpus for this period, and aspects of legitimisation will be approached through the study of archaism in statuary and representational art both in the context of Egyptian and foreign rule within Egypt.",
    "course_description": "This course covers a period of time during which foreign relations are crucial. The Second Intermediate Period encompasses the period of increased Asiatic ruler in the Delta, with the New Kingdom often characterised as the great period of Egyptian empire. Foreign relations and ultimately foreign rule within Egypt are also key elements throughout the Late Period.The course, combined with the lecture for the UG students, aims at equipping students with the key sources that are used for studying the period in question, and a knowledge of where to acquire reference material, information relating to objects, and to sites currently/recently excavated. Students will become familiar with textual sources in translation, which will also be the topic some seminar sessions. The course has a broad chronological framework, but certain themes have been picked out within this that run across the time periods, including administration and economy, foreign relations, kingship and ethnicity.Students will also have the opportunity to become more deeply acquainted with a specific time period/theme in preparation for one of the elements of coursework, in which they write a book review of a recently published volume, or a long article.The course aims to enable PG students to recognise objects of specific time periods, and also to gain familiarity with key sites, their archaeological evidence, and the landscape within which they existed in the past, as well as today.",

    "summary": "This course tackles the history of Judaea under Roman rule, concentrating on the period from Pompey's conquest of the East in 63 BCE until the immediate aftermath of the momentous events of 70 CE. Students will become acquainted with various aspects of the history of the region - social, economic, cultural and religious - through close study of a range of sources (including literary, numismatic and epigraphic).",
    "course_description": "In 70 CE, the Temple to the Jewish God in Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans, never to be rebuilt. This came at the end of a war that began in 66 CE, at around the time of the momentous events in Rome that led to the rise of the Flavians. Indeed, this victory became vitally important to the new dynasty in Rome, who capitalized on its import to justify the new regime. But what led to the rebellion in the first place? The history of Roman-Jewish relations prior to this point appears far from a catalogue of antipathy and conflict and the reasons for such a dramatic eruption of violence remain a point of contention today.This course tackles the history of Judaea under Roman rule, concentrating on the period from Pompey's conquest of the East in 63 BCE until the momentous events of 70 CE, when the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed, never to be rebuilt. Students will become acquainted with various aspects of the history of the region: social, economic, cultural and religious. A range of evidence will be employed, including archaeological, literary (in a range of genres), numismatic and epigraphic, in order that students may gain a full understanding of the complex history of Judaea under Roman rule.This course is co-taught with Professor Helen Bond in the School of Divinity.",

    "course_description": "The purpose of the course is to explore and assess a selection of current philosophies of history and their application. In particular, it is intended that the students should obtain through the seminars: (a) an understanding of what tends to be taken as 'givens' in much of the discipline and how there is no 'theory-free' practice of history; (b) a familiarity with some of the cogent philosophical debates pertinent to history and the ways in which they have an impact on how history is researched and written; (c) an ability to engage with these debates, assessing their pros and cons; (d) throughout, there is an intention to connect theory and practice, to assess how the questions raised and methodologies studied, have potential impact on the accounts of the past produced.The essays supplement the seminar programme and allow students to explore various aspects of the programme further or develop other directions not fully covered in the programme. In particular, it is intended that students should obtain through the essays: (a) a deeper understanding of a particular topic related to the overall framework of the course; (b) a greater capacity for assessment and critical analysis of a particular methodology or outlook; (c) an opportunity to develop essay writing skills.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

The course aims to bring together concepts from financial history, economics, sociology and anthropology to investigate the evolution and persistence of financier behaviours and social attitudes towards the financial industry over the last five centuries.",
    "course_description": "Together with financial history, the course introduces concepts from criminology, economics, sociology and anthropology to help investigate:-  The tension between the financial industry's claims on the value it adds to the economy and to society, and the recurring turmoil that is associated with its structures and the people who work in it.-  The tension between the public's acknowledgment of this potential value to the economy, and the resentment arising from the industry's perceived excesses.-  In a wider sense, the tension between the utilitarian and moral value of the financial world as far as the wider society is concerned.The course employs a variety of primary sources, including financial information, press reports, pamphlets, legal and parliamentary sources, non-textual sources like cartoons, portraits, and satirical prints, fictional and autobiographical accounts, and literary journalism. Part of the assessment of the course will be presenting and discussing a primary source connected with one of the themes discussed in the course. The course is structured thematically around several categories of claimed financial malfeasance and/or misbehaviour, ranging from bubbles, mass swindles (e.g. Ponzi schemes), individual rogue and insider trading, to broader issues concerning the relationship of principals and agents, creditors and debtors, and 'free' financial markets and state authorities and regulators. There is no chronological progression in the seminars, and students will be encouraged to focus on any period they find most instructive for their project.",

    "course_description": "This course will provide a broad introduction to Marine Archaeology and illustrate through a series of case studies how crucial the sea was in terms of human development. The social, economic and cultural progress of humanity has always been closely connected to the water and the sea. From the spread of human groups in early prehistory to the importance of container shipping and maritime commerce to modern economies today, sea travel has remained central to the development and maintenance of human societies. It seems odd then that it enjoys, at best, a supporting role in dominant historical narratives. In such narratives, it is common to read about the industrial and agricultural revolutions with little or no mention of the vital seafaring revolution that took place long before them. In this modern age of air travel, it is perhaps all too easy to underestimate the role of the sea. It is somewhat ironic that as global sea levels continue to rise, an awareness of the sea as a driver of human change and development has fallen at a similarly dramatic rate.Case studies discussed in the course range widely in terms of geography and chronology with examples from Scandinavia to Australia which range in date from 10,000 years ago to the last century. An example of some of the issues we may tackle are:Methods and techniques of underwater survey and excavationPost-excavation processing of underwater materialThe problems of conservation and wet finds processingShipwrecks from 1200 BCSunken harbours, sunken cities and processes of submergenceLake dwellings and freshwater archaeologyUnderwater archaeology vs. treasure huntingMarine Cultural Heritage and Sustainable DevelopmentPolicies and legal frameworks protecting Marine Cultural Heritage",

It introduces students to the peoples of the region, and the geographical unit of the Atlantic Archipelago (now the modern nations of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, England, and the various smaller island communities). It begins in the late-Roman/Iron Age period, covers the impact of Christianisation and the Vikings, and the impact of the Norman Conquest. We will explore core themes of religion, trade, mobility, food, and cross-cultural contact. A key aim of this course is to highlight the diversity in the archaeology of the region but also the high degree of interaction around the \"inner sea\" and how the different sub-regions reacted to similar external forces and events.Students will develop a strong grounding in the period and will analyse and discuss a range of archaeological evidence including (but not limited to) funerary archaeology, settlements, and bioarchaeology (including isotopic data and aDNA). In addition to lectures and seminars students will have the opportunity to get up close with early medieval material culture and sites through a museum visit and an optional fieldtrip.",

It focuses on the lively ancient source material and later scholarly debates. The students will learn to place the ever controversial subject of voluntary death in its broader ancient religious, political, philosophical and social contexts. Most crucially students will learn to read texts produced in honour (or condemnation) of ancient 'martyrs'  critically, with a keen eye for issues of ideology, theology, sexual and textual politics. This course should appeal to students with a range of interests, from ancient to medieval history, and from politics to philosophy to theology.",
    "course_description": "The course covers the subject of ancient voluntary death and martyrdom through a series of topical seminars, arranged both chronologically and thematically. In this way it leads students through the foundations of ideas of voluntary death in the Greek philosophical tradition through to Christian martyrdom and its legacy. Topics covered also include political martyrdom, Jewish martyrdom, the Christian martyr act, martyrdom and gender, and martyrdom and violence. Each session is focused around the reading of ancient texts as well as modern scholarly literature and thus provides an in-depth look at a subject rich in social, cultural and political as well as religious resonances.",

The roughly three-hundred-and-fifty-year period that is covered is significant because in this time we see the dominance of Asian countries in global trade as well as their eventual demise beginning in the 19th century.",
    "course_description": "The course is organized both chronologically and thematically and emphasizes the use of material and visual sources for historical inquiry. We will begin with a look at how Asian societies were interacting with each other prior to the arrival of Europeans at the end of the fifteenth century. Then we will spend several weeks looking at specific encounters between Asian societies and people from other parts of the world, including people from the Americas and Africa. The subsequent classes will focus on the movement of goods and people in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and the European expansion into and eventual dominance of Asian trade. Themes to be covered include: trade, globalization, religion, migration and diasporas.Students will read secondary sources as well as work with primary sources. In addition to studying textual sources, such as letters, treaties, merchant logs, students will learn how to use material and visual sources. In every lecture we will look closely at a particular object or painting pertaining to the topic and consider how it might be analyzed. In the discussion forum students will be asked questions about these sources. By the end of the semester students will be expected to use their knowledge of visual and material sources to create a virtual exhibit on a particular theme of Asian history (i.e., the Indian Ocean World in the 16th century or the introduction of Christianity in Japan). This exhibit will consist of a collection of 8-10 images, which will be accompanied by captions that help create a narrative and discuss what the visual and material sources tell us about the particular theme.",

Extending from the banks of the Rio Grande down to Patagonia, and including Brazil and much of the Caribbean, the expansive geographic and ethnic diversity of the region might make a survey of modern Latin America seem impossible.  Yet rather than try to present the past two hundred years as a isolated collection nations or cultures, this course seeks to understand the overlapping processes that animate and give meaning to the region as a whole.",
    "course_description": "Through the use of primary sources, secondary readings, film, music, and other materials, we will explore the historical evolution of the social, cultural, economic and political formation of Latin America in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  Among the central themes discussed are independence and sovereignty, postcolonialism, nation-building, liberalism, economic development, social stratification, gender relations, revolution, dictatorship, democracy, and globalisation.  We shall also work to understand the diverse ways historians have studied these processes, as they seek to uncover the agency of all Latin Americans - including farmers, factory owners, dictators, demonstrators, musicians, artists, and many others who shaped these societies.Through a variety of activities students will demonstrate a familiarity with the natural and political geography of Latin America as well as a firm command of the major historical periods, problems, processes, and personalities of post-independence Latin America.  In helping students approach a deep understand of the peoples, histories, and places of Latin America, this course will develop the conceptual and methodological skills that historians use to analyse and make arguments about both the past and the present.  These analytical skills are fundamental not only for the study of Latin America or the discipline of history, but for all future studies and professional paths.  By the end of this course students will learn to engage a wide range of information, to think both critically and openly, and to articulate those ideas in written assignments and classroom discussions.",

    "summary": "The spectre of corruption still haunts modern societies throughout the world, but how did medieval rulers define and combat corruption? Until recently the Middle Ages have been portrayed as an era of nepotism, venality, and other forms of systemic malfeasance (although not usually by medieval historians), and it has been argued that it was not until the rise of recognisably \"modern\" institutions of governance that these issues were addressed with any success. This course will demonstrate that medieval rulers not only recognised corrupt practices, but also tried to institute programmes of reform. Drawing on recent scholarship concerning the history of corruption, the course challenges the narrative that associates anticorruption programmes with modernity.",
    "course_description": "There has been growing interest in the history of corruption and recent work has recognised the importance of situating the meaning and practice of corruption in its historical context. Hitherto, it has been assumed that the successful implementation of anticorruption campaigns are related to modernisation and the development of the nation-state and its mechanisms of accountability. However, recent scholarship challenges these assumptions and highlights the ambiguity concerning what were -- and are -- considered corrupt practices, and how far anticorruption programmes were successful in eliminating these problems. This course uses as its working definition of corruption, that of the political scientist Michael Johnstone: \"the abuse, according to the legal or social standards constituting a society's system of public order, of a public role or resource for private benefit.\" As this definition makes clear, it is important to historicize corrupt practices.  Nevertheless, it is clear that those in positions of authority in the medieval world, like their predecessors in ancient Greece and Rome, and other pre-modern societies, recognised corrupt practices and attempted to curtail them through mechanisms of accountability, with varying degrees of success. Medieval people were also aware of the blurred distinction between licit and illicit practices. Accusations of corruption were used by those in positions of power -- as they are used today -- to stigmatize their political opponents, claim the moral high ground and, crucially, provide the legitimisation for their own authority. This rhetoric of malfeasance found its way into satirical texts and allegorical literature, as well as narrative and documentary sources. Royal courts and the papal curia became by-words for corruption, as is suggested by the popular medieval acronym ROMA (Radix Omnium Malorum Avaritia -- Avarice the root of all evils), and the satirist Walter Map's depiction of the court of King Henry II of England as \"Not Hell, but a place very like it.\" The modern historiography has also highlighted the limitations of state-centred approaches to the problem of corruption, emphasising the importance of the role of non-state actors. The seminars will make use of translated medieval primary sources to explore corrupt practices in several areas of medieval society, including royal governance, ecclesiastical institutions, and the urban mercantile arena. Students will explore documentary, normative, and narrative sources, as well as examples of the satirical literature mentioned above. The course will also introduce comparative materials from the Byzantine and Islamic worlds, especially texts that provided guides to good rulership (\"mirrors for princes\"). The seminars and readings will enhance the students' critical reading skills and encourage their ability to contribute to group discussions. It is hoped that the course will provide students with a more nuanced understanding of corruption and the attempts made to fight corrupt practices in the past.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. Although students may find it disturbing that the evidence of medieval corruption mirrors so closely modern examples of practices such as nepotism and malfeasance in public office, the course organiser does not anticipate the discussion of other sensitive topics. It is, however, difficult to entirely predict the directions discussions may take in seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

Greece), this area was a thriving and expanding economic powerhouse during the archaic period with a considerable archaeological and historical imprint. Ionia and in particular the city of Miletus is considered the birthplace of natural philosophy, with its intellectuals and craftsmen recognised beyond the borders of their homeland. The Greek cities maintained far-reaching contacts that encompassed the entire Mediterranean World while, at the same time, paying tribute to the Lydian and later Persian empire.

It enables students to study ancient history at an advanced level by requiring them to engage with both the 'primary' sources - artefacts of ancient literary and material culture - and with specialised, comparative and theoretical secondary material. Furthermore it encourages students to reflect on their own experience and that of our culture and bring insights from other historical periods and scholarly methodologies to their study of the past.",

Case-studies, including the evidence of Pompeii, the figure of Aesop, and literary sources ranging from various versions of the Hellenistic mime to late antique sermons form the focus of individual classes and seminars. In these classes students engage with a wide range of material - literary texts, images, graffiti, artefacts - as well as learning how to use to use (and assess the value of the use of) comparative, theoretical and methodological literature in their study of the past, an area in which ancient historians have often been weak.",

The Nile Valley is central to our understanding of these major steps, from the movement of human groups out of Africa, to the settlement of the first groups practising new lifeways integrating domesticated species and cultivated cereals. Debates at the cutting edge of research are central to this course, including the impact of environmental change on global and local scales, all of which seek to examine key elements within the human story, from the Middle Palaeolithic until the rise of the state in Egypt. The course will actively engage with groups living in regions surrounding the Nile Valley, including Libya and Nubia.",

The course will introduce students to current and past research themes within Egyptian prehistory, focussing predominantly on the shift to increasingly settled society, adoption of domesticated species, and increasing social hierarchy. Research-driven, the themes will address research questions including the timing and origin of the uptake of new 'Neolithic' lifeways, and the dynamics behind the growth of social complexity, including exchanges with other regions, and environmental change.Students who take this course will be investigating the lesser-known heritage of Egypt through a series of key current research themes. Students will become familiar with archaeological sites through the Nile Valley and Delta, including the surrounding regions of the Eastern and Western Deserts, the Sudan, and Sinai and Levant. Within their independent study time, as well as recorded lectures and live seminars, students will investigate the archaeological data that characterise sites of specific chronological periods, and types of subsistence, and able to interpret the presence of specific mobile and fixed evidence within the region being considered.

    "summary": "Prehistory is the lesser-known heritage of Egypt, but a heritage that represents millennia of global achievements of human groups. The Nile Valley is central to our understanding of these major steps, from the movement of human groups out of Africa, to the settlement of the first groups practising new lifeways integrating domesticated species and cultivated cereals. Debates at the cutting edge of research are central to this course, including the impact of environmental change on global and local scales, all of which seek to examine key elements within the human story, from the Middle Palaeolithic until the rise of the state in Egypt. The course will actively engage with groups living in regions surrounding the Nile Valley, including Libya and Nubia.",
    "course_description": "The movement of human groups through the Nile Valley corridor during periods of greening and aridification in the Sahara, to the first farmers, and the emergence of the world's first nation state, this course addresses major steps in human history that occurred in, and around, the Egyptian Nile Valley and Delta. The course will introduce students to current and past research themes within Egyptian prehistory, focussing predominantly on the shift to increasingly settled society, adoption of domesticated species, and increasing social hierarchy. Research-driven, the themes will address research questions including the timing and origin of the uptake of new 'Neolithic' lifeways, and the dynamics behind the growth of social complexity, including exchanges with other regions, and environmental change.Students who take this course will be investigating the lesser-known heritage of Egypt through a series of key current research themes. Students will become familiar with archaeological sites through the Nile Valley and Delta, including the surrounding regions of the Eastern and Western Deserts, the Sudan, and Sinai and Levant. Within their independent study time, as well as recorded lectures and live seminars, students will investigate the archaeological data that characterise sites of specific chronological periods, and types of subsistence, and able to interpret the presence of specific mobile and fixed evidence within the region being considered. Discussion of themes between the cohort will be maintained through the week through a non-assessed discussion forum.",

Drawing on a wide range of primary sources, this course examines the lives, actions, and representations of royal and aristocratic women between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries.

    "course_description": "Elite women played important roles within the Scottish political community and on a wider, European stage, even if narratives of the 'making of' medieval Scotland have tended to foreground male actors. Throughout this course, students will carefully assess women's involvement in politics and aristocratic culture between c.1066 and c.1328, examining figures such as queen consorts, royal mothers and daughters, countesses and noblewomen.The course will be structured around weekly seminars which explore different arenas of royal and aristocratic life. Crucial themes students will encounter include: marriage, diplomacy, patronage, commemoration, power and authority, models of rulership, administration, law, courtly culture, religion and identity. Students will reach a fuller understanding of women's significant contribution to political life and culture in medieval Scotland by analysing important shifts over the period, critically examining historiographical arguments, and appraising a variety of primary sources.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: physical violence, warfare and conquest, sexual violence, suicide and suicidal thoughts.

Special areas include: excuses and justifications of war, battle commemoration, oracular consultations, and cults for the war dead.  We will bring together material, literary, and epigraphic sources.",
    "course_description": "From the earliest description of warfare in the Homeric epics we see that the gods were not mere spectators in the conflict between the Greeks and the Trojans but were active participants. We do not see such direct involvement in later authors, but we know that there was popular belief that gods were interested in human affairs, particularly in one of the most important spheres of Greek activity, war. Owing to the interaction of the gods in war and their responsibility for its outcomes, both good and ill, religious settings were appropriate public spaces for referring, through a diverse range of images and objects, to battle.This module will examine the role that the ancient Greeks of the Archaic and Classical periods believed their gods played in warfare -- both wars between Greek states and wars against barbarians, especially the Persians. We will explore the material culture of warfare, how to read images of war on vase painting and sculpture, how Greeks commemorated battles in their sanctuaries by displaying their victories in a PanHellenic or local setting, how the war-dead were treated, and how hero-cults were formed for the fallen. We will investigate how this is done at a polis and personal level. We will examine how religion influenced decisions, formed sacred topography, offered excuses and justifications for war, and how authors such as Herodotus and Thucydides portray religion in their works. The module will use a wide range of resources -- archaeological, artistic, literary, and epigraphic -- to study Greek religion and warfare.",

Offering a range of transferable skills, this course will develop your potential for locating and working with resources, their critical evaluation, and the robust presentation of your ideas Â¿ through written as well as spoken media. Providing a solid research grounding, our core course is the foundation for skills to enable you to get the maximum benefit from your 'Ancient Worlds' MSc online. It will also help ensure that you make the right course choices to meet your goals.",
    "course_description": "Ancient Worlds is a diverse MSc programme in Archaeology and Classics, covering a huge chronological, as well as geographical range. To enable students to gain the maximum benefit from the programme, this compulsory core course will provide guidance and grounding in a range of appropriate skills and methods for research. This core course will provide skill sets and introductions to skill sets that are relevant to the study of archaeological material, including texts, objects, and contexts in the broadest sense.Due to its breadth, students opting for this MSc programme may have undergraduate degrees that have focussed within specific areas, e.g. Archaeology, Classics, and/or Ancient History, or aspects thereof.  Students of this 'Ancient Worlds' programme, will have varied goals, from aiming to narrow research focus into a specific time period within a region, for example, to wishing to widen regional or chronological knowledge to undertake comparative research. Students may have very clear ideas already of future research areas that they wish to pursue, or they may be looking to gain broader knowledge bases, with or without the intention of pursuing further research.To address the necessary range of themes appropriate, the course will be taught between the Archaeology and Classics Subject Areas, to provide specialist knowledge in research skills and methods that will be relevant to the course options that you will take as part of the MSc programme.The weekly topics have been designed to be of relevance to the wide variety of courses that you will study on your MSc programme, and for your dissertation research. Also, the topics deliver transferrable skills that have applications in many areas.The course will help you to develop your potential as a researcher through investigating how to locate and access resources that will be required not only for individual courses in the MSc programme, but for your dissertation research, and research post-programme. These resources include accessing librarybased publications, varied archival material, maps, and object assemblages within museum collections. Some of this material will be available only in person, and other material accessible online.The core course will be taught over 11 weeks and consist of a blend of screencasts, live seminars and a student Discussion Board. Through the screencasts we will deliver key aspects of information, and examples/case studies relevant to the weekly topics. The indicative weekly topics will be listed on LEARN. The live seminars will be an opportunity to discuss the themes in greater detail, and may be structured around a key article, data-set, and/or guided reading. These seminars will be recorded so that you have the opportunity to listen back to them, both for those who are able to attend, and those who cannot. Additionally, there will be a Discussion Board to encourage communications between students, allowing for an opportunity for general discussion as well as that focussed on specific questions.",

Detailed case studies of individual monuments, sites, and sculptural assemblages, from across the Roman empire, will further familiarize students with the ways in sculpture was viewed and understood in specific local contexts. Students learn about major monuments in Rome and Italy and other leading centres of the empire (such as Aphrodisias, Athens, Ephesus, and Lepcis Magna) and about the varying strands and contexts of representation in the eastern and western provinces. The materials used for sculpture, the distribution of them, the identify of sculptors, and how we might unravel the manufacturing process will also be examined.",

    "summary": "The aim of the course is to introduce students to some of the many roles the cult of saints played in the religious, political, social and cultural life of late medieval western Europe. Most of these wider themes will be illustrated through a focus on the development of saints' cults within late medieval Scotland, at both the national and local level",
    "course_description": "Across Western Europe the late medieval period was characterised by a great, and apparently increasing, popular interest in a variety of saints. The course examines some of the distinctive aspects of this popular devotion as it was manifested in late medieval Scotland. Topics covered include the growth of Marian devotion and burgeoning interest in the Virgin Martyrs, the role of military saints such as St George, the relationship between saints cults and secular power, the distinctive patterns of pilgrimage within Scotland and across Western Europe, and the generation of miracle-working cults around the figures of political figures such as Thomas of Lancaster and Simon de Montfort. Worksheets addressing the specific issues to be covered in each seminar will be distributed once students have selected the topics they wish to present on. Each session will also involve discussion of relevant primary sources and how they should be approached/interpreted as 'historical' documents.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: martyr tales and miracle stories. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "summary": "This course title might for some time have been considered an oxymoron. The Scottish Protestant Reformation was in important senses iconoclastic, but scholars are now also keen to emphasise its distinctive cultural world and processes of reconfiguration as well as removal. This course explores this culture by focusing on a different source type, genre or cultural form each week, together with thematic explorations of issues such as emotion and gender in sixteenth-century Scotland.",
    "course_description": "This course will explore the cultural world of the Scottish Reformation. Once seen as a straightforwardly iconoclastic shift from a sensual and communal faith to a cerebral and individualistic one, twenty-first century scholarship has suggested that Scotland's developing Protestantism involved a more complex set of processes of reconfiguration, adaptation, and continuity. The course will encourage you to engage with these debates, and will also enhance source analysis skills via a distinctive structure around different genres and source types. We will explore the culture of the Scottish Reformation by considering a series of forms of communication, and linked discussions of key themes such as emotion and the experience of Protestant life, the nature of religious argument, and the role of gender in these media.Firstly, the course will explore oral culture, via the sermon and music, especially the psalms, respectively. We will then consider textual evidence, looking at the spiritual poetry of the Scottish Reformation, and the more controversial bodies of polemical literature produced in conflicts within and beyond Protestantism. Thirdly, we will consider material and physical culture, starting with architectural and decorative elements, before zooming into the smaller-scale but no less significant subject of manuscripts and personal items as material culture and devotional practice. Finally we turn to forms of communal and collective activity, both officially sanctioned and mandated (communion and covenanting) and more challenging and even subversive (popular festivities). Along the way, we will undertake thematic reviews in seminars where we step back to reflect on the various cultural forms and debate their significance for key current issues in cultural history such as emotion and gender. As well as enhancing source analysis and research skills across a wide range of evidence types, the course will also develop your confidence in advancing independent arguments and interpretations.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: possible encounters with violent physical punishment of offenders by church courts.

    "summary": "The history of the Greeks is bound up with the Mediterranean and Black Seas: from an early period the highly indented coastline of Greece made sea travel the preferred means of travel, and the Greeks pioneered the shipbuilding technology that led to their settlements being spread widely across the Mediterranean littoral. Seamanship also played a crucial role in the defeat of the Persians at Salamis in 480 and the Athenian Empire that grew not long afterwards. This course aims to explore the Greeks' relationship with the sea through the study of environment, technology, and human knowledge.",
    "course_description": "'Like ants or frogs around a pond' -- so wrote Plato (Phaedo 109b), describing the inhabitants of the Mediterranean and Black Sea. The sea is a central element in Greek history. Mastery of seafaring and shipbuilding technology enabled Greek settlement to spread far beyond the confines of the Aegean; this same technology played a fundamental linking role in Greek interaction with non-Greek cultures, turning the sea from a barrier into a highway that sped goods, people, and ideas between and beyond the city-states. It also enabled the projection of power: the use of the sea for violent means enabled (e.g.) Greece's defence against the Persians to succeed, Athens' fifth-century maritime empire to be built, and Alexander's successors to compete for naval dominance of the Eastern Mediterranean. This course aims to explore how all of this worked at a practical level from the Archaic through Hellenistic periods: what was the nature of maritime technology in Greece, and how did it change over time? How did the conjunction of winds, currents, technology, and knowledge shape the pattern of Greek settlement? How did investment in maritime technology shape Greek city states -- whether through the benefits of trade, or through the need to invest in expensive naval technology (and the infrastructure, both physical and fiscal, to support it) and outcompete neighbouring powers? What was life like for the many Greeks who gained their livelihood from the sea? How did maritime trade work in practice? And how did exploration by sea enlarge the mental horizons of the Greeks and their perception of the wider world?",

Academically, architectural analysis has been the domain of Classical Archaeology; applying it to prehistoric architectures has demonstrated its wider research potential.The course introduces Buildings Archaeology, its methods and theory as well as academic and commercial applications. Lectures, seminars, and practicals will equip students with knowledge, skills and techniques necessary to study, interpret and reconstruct buildings from archaeological evidence. The syllabus seeks a balance between practical skills (drawing, photographic recording, digitising, buildings analysis, report writing, etc.) and academic theory to prepare students for academic as well as commercial careers. Studio presentations and discussions will reaffirm the experience from workshops and fieldwork and consolidate knowledge on how collected data feeds into research. Bringing in professional experts allows knowledge exchange and skill transfer to be informed by industry needs. The visit of a commercial company will provide students with industry insight. The intended learning outcomes are designed to foster the students' initiative and increase their employability and research capacities by equipping them with specialist skills and knowledge not offered at most other HEIs.The course will concentrate on prehistoric (Scottish, British and European) and Classical case studies, complemented by medieval, post-medieval and industrial examples to reflect all aspects of the academic and commercial jobs profile.This course will also include optional, but strongly recommended, fieldwork participation.",

    "summary": "This course explores why, when, and how people interact with difficult or traumatic histories as travelling tourists, as heritage visitors, or from the comfort of their own sofas. Through diverse case studies, we will explore what motivates people to visit or engage with sites of historical violence, persecution, death, disease, or disaster; what kinds of behaviour are expected from people visiting these sites (and how they actually behave); and what role historians should play in public understandings of these 'dark' places and histories.",
    "course_description": "Dark tourism refers to the practice of visiting -- physically, virtually, or imaginatively -- sites associated with, commemorating, and/or documenting difficult histories of violence, death, or disaster. Popular and academic interest in these sites and those who visit them has exploded over the past two decades. This course takes a broad definition of dark tourism to explore case studies ranging from the darker end of the spectrum -- such as sites of genocide perpetration -- through to those places where a more light-hearted engagement with dark pasts is encouraged -- such as family friendly dungeon experiences or the irreverent Horrible Histories series. We will also explore case studies that seem to blur the boundaries between the darker and lighter sides of dark tourism, such as the taking of selfies at memorial sites or the viral video Dancing Auschwitz. The course deals in particular detail with modern and contemporary history, but also incorporates some pertinent examples from earlier periods.Drawing on a combination of secondary reading, primary sources, and user analysis of dark tourism practices and products, the module seeks to analyse the motivations of those who visit dark tourism sites, asking whether dark tourists are driven more by an ethical desire to bear witness to atrocity or a voyeuristic fascination with the macabre. We will consider what behaviours and understandings the historical professionals who curate and manage difficult heritage places expect visitors to display, and the extent to which users themselves conform with these expectations. We will also pose the question of what makes dark tourism 'dark', what distinguishes a jovial horrible history from an unspeakable horrific history, and whether there is a 'too soon' temporal horizon governing this distinction. In the process, students will also engage with broader questions about how power dynamics and inequalities are manifested in heritage discourses and the role historians should play in public understandings of the past. The Dark Side will develop students' awareness of how history operates outside universities, their ability to engage sensitively and critically with difficult or traumatic histories, and their skills in user analysis and project evaluation. It may be of particular interest to those with an interest in interdisciplinary study and those pursuing careers in heritage, media, or the third sector.Content note: This course deals with difficult, sensitive, and potentially distressing material on a weekly basis, including, for instance, death, genocide, violence, disaster, human remains, colonialism, sexual violence, and discrimination. This list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter on this module, but it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "summary": "It has been stated that '...while children are a relatively unchanging fact of life, childhood is a constantly shifting concept' (Marten, 2018: 1). This course will explore childhood as a social construct, and the archaeological evidence for differing experiences of children over time and space. It will incorporate multidisciplinary perspectives from history, classics, and anthropology on themes such as identity, agency, gender, mobility, health and diet, structural violence and political/social reform.",
    "course_description": "The study of children and childhood has long been of interest in the fields of archaeology, history, and classics, highlighting the importance of this particular age group in understanding past societies. It is a matter of fact that children have always been present throughout pre-history to the modern-day, but their voices and lived experiences have not always been directly accessible, often presented through an archaeological record generated, and interpreted, by adults. The concept of 'childhood' too is a social construct, subject to the needs of a population within a particular geographic or temporal context, and economic, political, cultural and environmental influence.Within this course, students will take a critical approach to how we can identify evidence of children and childhood in the past through a combination of theoretical and scientific approaches, including osteoarchaeology, analysis of settlements, material culture, and funerary practices. It will also incorporate historical, classical, and anthropological perspectives to explore the shifting perception of childhood over time and space, and evidence of identity and agency of children in past societies, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary research. It will cover a range of themes including: childcare practices, health and disease, death and burial, voluntary and forced migration, domestic and occupational roles, marginalised childhoods, and transitions between life stages. Recognising the unique role that the study of childhood in the past can play in the education of children in the present day, students will also consider the value of research-led public outreach initiatives throughout the course. They will also gain hands-on experience in analysis of archaeological human skeletal remains during a lab-based practical session.",

    "summary": "It has been stated that '...while children are a relatively unchanging fact of life, childhood is a constantly shifting concept' (Marten, 2018: 1). This course will explore childhood as a social construct, and the archaeological evidence for differing experiences of children over time and space. It will incorporate multidisciplinary perspectives from history, classics, and anthropology on themes such as identity, agency, gender, mobility, health and diet, structural violence and political/social reform.",
    "course_description": "The study of children and childhood has long been of interest in the fields of archaeology, history, and classics, highlighting the importance of this particular age group in understanding past societies. It is a matter of fact that children have always been present throughout pre-history to the modern-day, but their voices and lived experiences have not always been directly accessible, often presented through an archaeological record generated, and interpreted, by adults. The concept of 'childhood' too is a social construct, subject to the needs of a population within a particular geographic or temporal context, and economic, political, cultural and environmental influence.Within this course, students will take a critical approach to how we can identify evidence of children and childhood in the past through a combination of theoretical and scientific approaches, including osteoarchaeology, analysis of settlements, material culture, and funerary practices. It will also incorporate historical, classical, and anthropological perspectives to explore the shifting perception of childhood over time and space, and evidence of identity and agency of children in past societies, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary research. It will cover a range of themes including: childcare practices, health and disease, death and burial, voluntary and forced migration, domestic and occupational roles, marginalised childhoods, and transitions between life stages. Recognising the unique role that the study of childhood in the past can play in the education of children in the present day, students will also consider the value of research-led public outreach initiatives throughout the course. They will also gain hands-on experience in analysis of archaeological human skeletal remains during a lab-based practical session.",

Students will engage with international case studies exploring the practical and conceptual nature of these interactions, and their context and consequence on local and global scales, from individual pet keeping to the worldwide spread of farming. Focussing primarily on the archaeological past, it will also draw on selected ethnographic case studies. The course also provides contextualisation to current and future global challenges centred on how we live with animals.The subject will be explored through a mixture of lectures, in-class discussions, and student presentations. Weekly lectures will cover major themes, with focus on the different forms and impacts of relationships, and critical assessment of how this is evidenced and investigated from the archaeological record. Students will give short presentations exploring specific examples of past human-animal relationships drawn from the breadth of past human experience that will augment these major themes. These insights will be expanded through in-depth discussions in seminars to explore theoretical models of human-animal relationships. These seminars will address key conceptual and evidential challenges to understanding past human-animal relationships.",

This course will provide an overview on migratory processes from prehistory to the present, focusing on archaeological sources but also incorporating written evidence whenever available.",
    "course_description": "Migrations represent one of the most defining features of human history since its beginnings to the present. In recent years, archaeological research has witnessed the so-called 'third science revolution', triggered by the development of bioarchaeological methods - especially archaeogenetics and isotopic analyses. These approaches have forced us to radically rethink mobility in the past and develop new pathways of integrating all available evidence to move beyond simple narratives of human migration. Due to its long-term perspective, archaeology is in an advantageous position to contribute to a deeper reflection on the topic, by not only counteracting isolationist narratives, but also showing the complexity of human mobility in the past and present and the challenges and opportunities it poses.This course will provide an overview on migratory processes from early prehistory ('out of Africa' in the Palaeolithic) to the 21st century. It will combine an introduction to the key definitions and theoretical perspectives on migration with the presentation of specific case studies from different periods and geographical regions. While the main emphasis will be on the material evidence of migrations, other sources including texts will also be incorporated whenever available. Thus, the course has an interdisciplinary design, and should be attractive for students from different subject areas.",

    "summary": "The module explores the art and archaeology of Sparta and Laconia from the Geometric through the Classical period. Through the study of archaeological, art-historical, and textual sources, we will think of the image and reality of Spartan austerity, the relationship of Sparta and its perioikic neighbours in Laconia and Messenia, issues of art and craft production, social divisions, and Laconia's connections with the wider Mediterranean. The material will be placed in a political, social, and religious context.",
    "course_description": "Sparta's image as an austere society devoid of architectural embellishments and artistic production is known from the famous passage of the Classical-period author, Thucydides (1.10.2). However, the archaeological evidence from the eighth, seventh, sixth, and early fifth centuries BCE show that Sparta in the preceding centuries, had a rich local tradition in the arts and crafts, such as vase-painting, bronze work, bone and ivory carving, and sculpture. Its temples were embellished with elaborate architectural and decorative programs that show that Sparta, although had knowledge of current trends in the Greek world, it also followed a distinct local artistic and architectural tradition. Thus, Classical Sparta's image as we read in later sources, where it features as a Greek polis, which saw the militarisation of its male citizens and with no interest in art, does not translate into the previous centuries.This course will study the art and archaeology of Sparta and the region of Laconia from the Geometric through the Classical periods. It will be an interdisciplinary course where archaeological, textual, and art-historical sources will be used to consider several themes, such as the myth of the Spartan austerity, the relationship of Sparta and its perioikic neighbors in Laconia and Messenia, Spartan and Laconian sanctuaries and cults, burial customs, issues of art and craft production, social divisions (homoioi, perioikoi, helots, and women) and Laconia's connections with the wider Mediterranean especially, but not exclusively, through trade. We will pay special attention to the well-known Laconian black-figure vase painting, which, with its distinct shapes and iconography, was exported in the Greek world and beyond, and we will study the art and craft of bronze vessels and the impact of Laconian art abroad.",

    "course_description": "In many parts of Eurasia, the 1st millennium BC marked a fundamental turning point that was accompanied by the appearance of a whole range of phenomena that were to play an important part in shaping our world. Some of the key elements we might mention are early state formations, urbanisation, coinage, and intercontinental trade networks. In temperate Europe, this age of increasing mobility of people, ideas and goods saw the development of the first urban agglomerations, the appearance of sumptuous aristocratic burials, and close contacts with the Mediterranean world.This course provides an overview on the main developments that took place between c. 800 BC - AD 50, from the centralisation processes of the Hallstatt period (the so-called 'princely seats') to the development of Celtic art, the rise of the Late Iron Age oppida, and finally the Roman conquest.

    "course_description": "On 17 December 2014, US President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro announced that a new era in Cuban-US relations was to begin. In their speeches they owed that their shared troubled history no longer presented an insurmountable obstacle to the normalisation of diplomatic relations. This course will examine their relationship from 1898 (the end of Spanish colonial rule) to 2014. It will discuss how two dominant but competing narratives have shaped the interaction between these neighbours. On the one hand, US policymakers believed that they had given Cuba freedom in 1898 and the subsequent close political, economic and cultural ties were a reflection of mutual understanding and friendship. In this view, Fidel Castro was a tyrant who imposed a dictatorship. On the other, Cuban nationalists argued that US intervention in 1898 was intended to prevent a separatist victory; the subsequent Cuban Republic was a protectorate designed to serve the interests of the US. In this view, Castro's Revolution of 1959 was the fulfilment of the mutilated victory of 1898; Cuban identity and the Revolution were inseparable. This course will make extensive use of primary sources to analyse the two main phases of Cuban-US relations. The first part discusses the extent to which the US could impose its will on the Cuban Republic; in particular students will re-consider the career of Fulgencio Batista, traditionally the arch-villain of Cuban history. The second part deals with impact of the Cuban Revolution and will discuss the obstacles to  rapprochement between the two states.Seminar Outline:1. Introduction2. War and Occupation 1898-19023. The Platt Era 1902-334. The Cuban Revolution 19335. A New Deal for Cuba? 1934-526. Batista, Castro and Eisenhower 1953-597. The Breakdown, 1959-618. The Cuban Missile Crisis, 1962.9. The Revolution Under Siege 1963-8810. From Cold War to Colder War 1989-200011. The Same Old Story? 2001-14Content note: This course will expose students to a considerable variety of approaches in the field of international history, including, but not limited to ideological conflict, political discord and war. Students taking the course need to be prepared to engage with historical actors on their own terms and grapple with ideas and movements with which they may personally disagree. Engaging with a diverse range of viewpoints is integral to the study of History at a university.

At the end of the course students will be familiar with current academic discussions about (1) the character and periodization of the Cold War in Latin America, (2) the escalation of Cold-War conflict and violence, (3) the ideology and practice of Latin American militant groups and authoritarian or semi-authoritarian governments during the Cold War, (4) the Cuban Revolution and its impact on the region, (5) the role of the superpowers in shaping Latin America's Cold-War experience, and (6) the impact of the Cold War on current political imaginaries in the region.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

This course aims to provide an advance introduction to some of their major themes, their evolution through the central Middle Ages (11th-13th centuries), and their interpretations by scholars. They will include topics such as management, legitimacy, criticism, the background of the participants, warfare, relations with non-Christians, non-Latin Christians and Christian dissenters, as well as the legacy of the crusades to the present day. Indeed, it will not focus only on the crusades directed to the Holy Land, but will rather take a pluralist approach that considers other theatres too, from the Iberian peninsula, to the Baltic Sea and the Byzantine world, as well as campaigns that targeted heretics and political enemies of the Papacy from within Western Christendom. The same variety will apply to the range of primary sources that will be examined, which includes Western, Jewish, Byzantine and Muslim accounts, thus considering a great variety of views and different perceptions of the phenomenon. Indeed, in the period examined by this course the crusades became quite a pervasive phenomenon of medieval society, to the extent that, in many ways, this course constitutes, through the lens of the crusades, an advance introduction to European and the Mediterranean worlds of the central Middle Ages in general.Week 1 Introduction: what were the crusades?Week 2 Authority, legitimacy and management: popes, kings, barons, and popular crusades [asynchronous forum seminar]Week 3 Who were the crusaders?

The purpose of this course is to complicate that view by recovering some less familiar beliefs and ideas that did not contribute to the 'modernity' of the European Enlightenments, but were an integral part of them.",
    "course_description": "In public discourse the Enlightenment continues to be regarded (and usually celebrated) as a key moment in the transition to modernity. As a result, discussions about the Enlightenment have a tendency to turn into debates about the benefits and disadvantages of modernity, understood in a particular way. The defenders of modernity will emphasise the importance of, for example, rationalism, tolerance, scientific and technological progress, and political and economic freedom, all of which, it is said, are modern values that were promoted or even invented by the Enlightenment. Critics of modernity will accuse its defenders of shallow optimism and of turning a blind eye to the harmful effects of modernity, among which they may include the environmental costs of technological change, a casual disregard for the dangerous uses to which scientific discoveries can be put, a narrowly economic understanding of well-being, or an arrogant belief in the superiority of 'the West' over other cultures. The conflation of Enlightenment with a certain kind of modernity also explains why in recent years the Enlightenment has been held up as an antidote to religious (mainly Islamic) fundamentalism and political populism.The purpose of this course is to complicate those views by focusing on ideas and beliefs which were clearly part of the eighteenth-century European Enlightenments, but are not compatible with their reputation for promoting modernity.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: racial discrimination; gender-based discrimination, slavery, war and violent conflict. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

Has keyword searching reshaped the questions we ask about the past? Do maps and graphs provide a more accessible and objective way to present our findings than traditional linear texts? How can historians tackle things such as digital ethics, information overload and algorithmic bias?This course offers a comprehensive look at the challenges and opportunities of doing history in this new environment, with a particular focus on the study of the medieval and early modern periods. It is structured around the lifecycle of a research project. The first few weeks focus on how to approach and manipulate sources by digital means, followed by sessions on digital analysis and interpretation, mapping and visualisation, communication and collaboration. As the semester unfolds, students will have the chance to develop a project of their own, and practice critical skills in the production and dissemination of knowledge in today's digital world.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

Did comparable 'renascences' take place outside of Europe and how do these affect European narratives of modernity? In this challenging course you will be encouraged to question traditional histories of the Italian Renaissance by means of a thorough engagement with new critical perspectives, the reading of a well focused range of secondary material, and sustained reflection on original sources, representations and objects. Emphasis shall be placed on debate and reflection in seminars and in weekly online forum posts which will be continually assessed and form 30% of the final mark.",
    "course_description": "The origins and nature of the Italian Renaissance have been regularly debated since the highly influential statement made by Jacob Burckhardt in The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy: An Essay (1860). For example, medieval historians have questioned the supposedly exceptional nature of the Renaissance by asserting that cultural renaissances also took place in parts of Europe during the eighth or twelfth centuries. However, some of the most interesting contributions to this debate have recently been stimulated by the 'global turn' in Renaissance studies. Historians and social scientists have challenged the universalising view that the Renaissance helped to foster global 'modernity' and they have also attacked the Eurocentric model of the Renaissance, which has been applied to other civilisations, including China and India. This course provides an introduction to these important debates in the field of Renaissance history. Students shall move from a broad conceptual grounding in the first part (Weeks 1-3) to a consideration of primarily Italian evidence for, and textual or artistic representations of contact with the world in the second part (Weeks 4-6), before considering how contacts with the world impacted on Italian economic, intellectual, and cultural histories (Weeks 7-9). In this part greater emphasis will be placed on the view of Italy from the rest of the world culminating (Weeks 10-11) in a discussion about the validity of the Italian Renaissance model for Italy or for the rest of the world.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

    "course_description": "This course explores the many ways in which eighteenth-century Britons travelled to and encountered the European continent. Starting with an overview of eighteenth-century attitudes towards travel and the foreign, it explores the Grand Tour, the period's most famous culture of travel shared by young elite men that held enormous social and cultural influence over Britain's political, economic, and cultural systems, alongside the development of more diverse forms of travel: the 'professional' travels of diplomats, soldiers, explorers and merchants, the rapidly rising culture of pleasure travel amongst older elites, middling sorts, women and families, the development of domestic travel, and the more hidden travel experiences of numerous attending servants and even pets. Uncovering the rich, varied and well documented travel cultures of eighteenth-century Britain, it ends by pondering the implications of the Napoleonic War and rise of Romantic travel at the end of the long eighteenth century, and the afterlife of travel once travellers had returned safely home.In this course, we will use a wealth of primary sources and a range of interdisciplinary methods to explore the rapidly developing historiography of travel history. We will situate the practices, writings and cultures of travel within the wider context of eighteenth-century Britain and engage critically with the diverse methodological and theoretical approaches that scholars are currently using to revise and develop this field of scholarship. The course offers a chance to examine a fascinating phenomenon that has left a rich legacy of printed, manuscript, artistic, architectural and other material traces, and provides a timely opportunity to explore how British people saw themselves and their changing relationships with continental Europe across the eighteenth century.",

    "course_description": "This course explores the role of the city, the Greek polis, in the Hellenistic world. Many have thought that the polis ended with Alexander, so the validity of this position will be examined. Key themes will include civic identity, the interaction between cities and with kings, cult and euergetism and the spread of Greek culture, but the selection of themes will also vary according to the interests of those taking the course. Other possible topics would include specific cities such as Athens or Alexandria, education, food supply, diplomacy, philosophers, public buildings, democracy, leagues and federations. An understanding of the Hellenistic world is particularly important for understanding the development of the Roman empire in the East. All taking the course will be expected to do a presentation on a subject of their choice.",

The course will consider the emergence of urban centres in the \"Assyrian Colonies Period\", the unification of the Hittite kingdom, the import of Mesopotamian concepts of kingship, religion and society, and peaceful and violent interaction with neighbouring peoples. The course will also consider the Hittites' interaction with their fragile environment and the factors which eventually led to the kingdom's collapse.",
    "course_description": "The course provides an in-depth survey of Hittite civilisation, one of the most powerful Near Eastern empires of the Late Bronze Age. The course examines the emergence of urban civilisation in the highlands of central Anatolia (modern Turkey), the development and introduction of writing systems in this area, the role of technological innovation and ideological changes through the successive stages of development of Hittite civilisation until its rise to prominence in the 'Empire Period' (ca 1400-1200 BC) and final collapse around 1200 BC. The evidence considered is primarily from the excavation of settlement sites, monumental artwork, iconography and textual sources. Questions and debates about state formation and collapse are of particular importance, as well as Hittite adaptation to an economically challenging and difficult-to-control environment, the background of the gradual importation of Mesopotamian concepts about society and religion, and Hittite general interaction with powerful neighbours in Mesopotamia, Syria, the Levant and Egypt.This course is meant to be of interest for students who wish to learn more about early Near Eastern and Mediterranean civilisations, the development and interaction of urban, state-level societies in the Old World, and their material and textual legacy. Weekly topics include: The (re-) discovery of Hittite civilisation, Assyrian trade colonies and local communities in early second millennium Anatolia, the rise of the Hittite State, languages and writing systems, Hittite society and settlement, Hittite economy, the military, Hittite religion between traditional piety and imperial ideology, Hittite monuments, northern and western neighbours of the Empire and the collapse of the Hittite Empire.",

It will address important historical questions about the ideological framework of Nazi antisemitism, the motivation of perpetrators, the experience of the victims and the various forms of commemoration of the Holocaust in different societies and in different political contexts. Drawing on published and translated source collections, testimonies of survivors and other documentation this course will generate a comprehensive assessment of the Holocaust.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: discrimination, antisemitism, racism and racial violence, graphic descriptions of violence and death and discussions of trauma. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "course_description": "The history of the Western Isles in the medieval period is intriguing. For much of the period the Hebrides lay outside the political, administrative and social structures and cultural developments of the emergent monarchies, particularly the Scottish and English kingdoms, that dominated the British Isles and Ireland. The chief men of the Isles maintained a high degree of autonomous power despite living in a maritime world subject to the ambitions of the Norse, Scottish and English monarchies and Irish provincial kings. The complex and fluid nature of claims to 'sovereignty' and social pre-eminence in the Western Isles means that the region does not fit comfortably, if at all, into the 'national' narratives around which most modern historical writing has been organised. The chronological coverage of the course spans almost two centuries. Its opening date is provided by the first use of the Latin phrase 'Dominus Insularum', lord of the Isles, in documents of 1336 and its closing date, 1545, by the final failed attempt to revive the lordship, which had been forfeited to the Scottish crown in 1493.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. The course organiser has not identified any sensitive content within this course's focus, however course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "course_description": "The Lydian Empire stretched from the Mediterranean coast to the Halys river in the Anatolian interior. Our understanding of the empire has long been filtered by the Greek perspective and, in particular, Herodotus' Lydian Logos (Hdt. 1:6-94), written by the historian about 120 years after the fall of the empire. There he describes in remarkable detail the close entanglement of the Lydian elites with the Greek world. He reports on, for example, the Lydian kings visiting the oracle of Apollo in Delphi or a conversation that supposedly took place between Lydian king Kroisos and the Athenian statesman Solon. The one-sided perspective sometimes obscures as well as reveals: while Lydians were admired for their proverbial wealth and luxurious textiles, Greek authors looked down on the effete lifestyle of their elite and consequently to members of the Greek elite that emulated this idle leisure. This form of moralizing tells us more about the Greeks than the Lydians, and detracts from their unique contributions, including the fact that the Lydian state was the first to use coinage and famously extracted their gold from the river Pactolus that flows through their capital at Sardis. Over the last 50 years, archaeological research in Lydia has begun to transform our understanding of the empire. This course will familiarise students with the material culture (e.g. architecture, pottery, metalwork, coinage) and social and religious customs of Lydia during the archaic period and investigate the interactions with their Greek neighbours (most of all Karians and Ionians) through the analysis of reciprocal influence visible in the material culture.",

This course discusses recent advances made in Historical and Archaeological scholarship that elucidate both the events themselves and the context in which they unfolded.",
    "course_description": "The traditional narrative surrounding the Maccabaean Revolt is fairly simple. A Greek king wanted to eradicate Judaism, but the Jews, led by the heroic Maccabees, fought back and prevailed. This story still has its uses in modern foundation myths, but it has long been argued that things were in fact much more complex. The motivations of Antiochus IV on the one hand and the resistance fighters of the other have been interpreted in various ways, leading to wildly different conceptions of the whole sequence of events. New narratives have recently been published that call into question the very reality of the persecution, and give completely different accounts of the real reasons for the revolt. While no new consensus is in sight, a number of new finds - inscriptions, archaeological remains, previously unrecognized parallels elsewhere - shed important light on this crucial moment in Hellenistic history. Focusing on a very limited timespan (ca. 200 to 152 BC), this course explores how recent advances and old insights can help to understand the events in their historical context.",

This course addresses such questions, focusing on a millennium between the eighth and eighteenth centuries and drawing from an exciting array of primary and secondary sources. It delves into major debates and issues in the emerging field of oceanic histories, with an emphasis on the Indian Ocean, the oldest in terms of human usage and voyage and the largest in terms of its coastal population.",
    "course_description": "Oceans play a central role in world history, shaping human life across time. Many seas and oceans profoundly influence life on earth; civilizations rise and fall and countless individuals thrive or perish along their waters and shores. Long before the Age of Discoveries and Explorations, the Indian Ocean served as a vital maritime zone, facilitating the exchange of commodities, communities and ideas across the globe. For over 5000 years, its rhythmic patterns of the monsoon winds have influenced interactions among diverse continents, countries and contexts. Traders, sailors, slaves, scholars, adventurers, pirates, and others who traversed this ocean, whether by choice or coercion, left enduring impacts on the majority who remained ashore. The monsoons have shaped shared systems on its islands, coasts, and hinterlands in Asia, Africa, and Australia, fostering intertwined lives, livelihoods, cultures, and economies that have been influenced by broader changes in climate and environment.Through a close examination of many exciting primary sources, this course highlights the richness of global interactions across the Indian Ocean world in premodern centuries. The framework of oceanic histories provides insights into the long trajectories of human and geographical past, transcending national and continental boundaries. By exploring interactions among Asian, African, Australian, and European communities in the medieval era, it facilitates a nuanced understanding of the Global South on its own terms. The course also offers a longue-durÃ©e perspective on ongoing global climate changes and the strategies developed by people in the oceanic region to prevent, overcome or adapt to catastrophes.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: castration, slavery, sexual and racial violence.

    "summary": "The tenth to fourteenth centuries in Europe witnessed the emergence of a distinctive Latin Church. The product of an intense process of reform which inspired new and vibrant cultures of belief, the architects of this Church also built inequality into its very structure and oversaw the violent persecution of the 'unorthodox'. This course traces this turbulent shift by reading the lives of nine infamous ecclesiastical figures from the margins of medieval society.",
    "course_description": "In this course, we will examine the emergence of the Latin Church in the central-late Middle Ages through the lives of nine figures. Reading the wide variety of sources for these lives from the perspectives of the less powerful groups with which these people collaborated, slandered, praised, and persecuted, we consider how inequality was woven into the fabric of the nascent Latin Church as it carved out a distinct identity. From Peter Damian's misogynistic invective against priests' wives, to Elizabeth of Hungary and Francis of Assisi's injunction to identify with the poor and sick, to Stephen of Bourbon's exhumation and burning of the bones of a sacred dog, we explore the roles played, consciously and unconsciously, by the marginalised in the formation of the Church. In so doing, students will gain confidence in tracing longue durÃ©e histories of inequality, and in thinking against and beyond standard archives, as well as gaining or enhancing their knowledge of the medieval Church.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner.

The course explores key themes in the archaeology of the Neolithic drawn from case studies across the Near East and Europe.",
    "course_description": "This course will investigate the key thematic, regional, and chronological dimensions of the Neolithic. Through looking across multiple regions, the real benefit of the diversity of the course is clear in that expressions of the 'Neolithic' are vastly different, more or less prevalent, intra- as well as inter-regionally. Regional studies that will be reflected through this course, reflect the myriad of differing ways in which communities have, or have not, taken up multiple aspects of what was once described as the 'Neolithic package', and will tackle the reasons for this. What has been described as Neolithisation is a very inconsistent phenomenon in so far as the archaeological record is concerned, if a phenomena at all. The geographical diversity of the course - through modern Europe, the Mediterranean, Middle East and North Africa, highlights the transition to more highly settled communities, while allowing students to investigate reasons for the highly variably regional take up of new ways of life.The subject will be explored through a mixture of screencasts and discussion seminars. Screencasts will cover major themes, with focus on the key aspects of the Neolithic and critical assessment of how this is evidenced and investigated from the archaeological record. These insights will be expanded through in-depth discussions in seminars to explore key debates. These seminars will address key conceptual and evidential challenges to understanding the Neolithic.",

The problems of securing balanced and equitable economic growth since the end of the colonial period, the impact of 'liberalisation' and globalisation, and the evolution of the conflicts between the nations of the subcontinent, which have most recently acquired a thermo-nuclear dimension, will also be considered. Additionally the course will examine the evolution of society at a local level, such as the struggle for the rights and freedoms of women and the lower castes, and the changing nature of what it means to be Indian, Pakistani, Hindu or Muslim, a Mohajir, Bengali or Tamil, adivasi or dalit in contemporary South Asia.",

    "summary": "What do processes of archive building and history writing tell us about the Arabic-speaking world in the modern period? This course looks at the emergence of history as significant space for the articulation of the region's presents and futures. Using an in-depth case-study approach, it interrogates the construction of the region's historiographical ecosystems as a space where different actors negotiated their visions of self, state, and society.",
    "course_description": "The course examines how writing history in the Arabic-speaking world was itself a historical process, one that is deeply intertwined with political, social, and material processes that have made the modern Middle East. Taking an in-depth case-study approach, it explores the evolution of history writing in different settings and at different moments in time. The course spans the eighteenth century to the present, and includes case studies from Syria, Egypt, Palestine, Algeria, and Saudi Arabia. Each case elucidates the stakes involved in writing history, and sheds light on the changing authority to tell the past (and use it to shape the present).The course examines the development of historiography along two axes. The first is the development of the field from pre-modern Arabo-Islamic modes of writing history, tracing the syncretic manner in which the modern professional discipline was developed using the methods and forms of older traditions of knowledge. The second is tracing the use of history by states and non-state actors in particular moments of upheaval and transition -- collapse of empires, nation-state building, revolutions, regime consolidation -- as an entry point to unpacking the narrative battles before the consolidation of now-hegemonic narratives. Overall, it unpacks history's relationship to power in the modern Middle East. The course seeks to expand the history of historiography of the Middle East beyond historians, their methods, and their texts. It examines the broader historiographic ecosystem from which historical knowledge emerged, this includes the compilation of collections, the establishment of institutions, the formation of scholars, the reordering of urban space, and the dissemination of knowledge. It explores how men (and some women) have contributed to processes of telling the past, and how these processes provide a glimpse into their view of their self, their society, the states that were (re)forming, and their encounter with the colonising other.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: racial, colonial, and state violence.

The Templars were a monastic order of warrior-monks, who epitomised the military-religious ideology of Latin Christendom, yet they were also prominent bankers and traders whose networks stretched from Britain to the Levant, and helped connect Christendom to the Islamic world.

Within years the Templars had become a significant force in Syria, Palestine and in the West, forging a reputation for military prowess as well as accumulating vast wealth and influence. However, in 1307 the Templars in France were arrested on the orders of King Philip the Fair. In the name of the Inquisition, their property was seized and the men charged with a host of severe heresies, including the denial of Christ, homosexuality and idol worship. Confessions extracted under torture were brought before royal and papal tribunals, and although defences were mounted in their support, in 1312 Pope Clement V officially dissolved the Order. In March 1314, Jacques de Molay, the last Grand Master of the Templars, was burned at the stake in Paris.Seven hundred years after the suppression of the Order, the trial of the Templars still arouses enormous controversy and speculation. This course will cut through the rumours and myths surrounding the Templars to examine their rise to power and uncover the causes for their subsequent destruction. It will begin with the establishment of the crusader states and the foundation of the Templars, before exploring their role in the crusades of the thirteenth century and the fall of the Holy Land in 1291. The course will then focus on the situation in Europe at the turn of the fourteenth century, especially the growing influence of the French Crown over the papacy. The arrest and trial of the Templars from 1307-1312 will then be analysed in detail, drawing from a range of sources, including trial records, arrest warrants, confessions, inquisitorial accounts and diplomatic correspondence. The course will end with a look into the trial of the Templars in Scotland and the formation of myths surrounding the last members and the legacy of the Order.

As well as analysing the activities of the Republican Party in power and in pursuit of power, the course explores the development of conservative ideas and of conservative movements over time.",
    "course_description": "Conservatism is currently among the most fertile fields of study on twentieth-century U.S. political history. In 1994, historian Alan Brinkley observed that scholars of the United States during the twentieth century had largely failed to explain the strength of conservative politics, generally choosing to focus instead on liberals and liberalism. Since then, this literature has undergone a significant transformation, as historians have tackled many of the oversights identified by Brinkley and have pursued other research questions as well. The result is an increasingly sophisticated body of work. This course will encourage students to explore the historiography of modern American conservatism and to engage with key debates within this literature. It will help students to identify research topics for further investigation. The course will investigate the modern history of conservative ideas in the United States, the strategies of conservative politicians in pursuit of power and their actions once they won power, and the development of movements that sought to mobilise grassroots support for conservative ideas. The most intensely contested debate that the course analyses involves the reasons for the decline of liberalism and the rise of conservatism from the 1960s onwards. The course will explore methodologies and approaches taken by scholars - including not only historians but also those working within other disciplines, notably that of politics - to their investigations of the subject. It will also explore the nature of the primary material available to historians in studying different aspects of the subject.",

This course will examine the possibilities and limitations of employing history as a toolkit to develop, and reflect on, practical skills for the conduct of statecraft. It will use an interdisciplinary approach and draw upon a large and diverse body of writings composed from antiquity to the present.",
    "course_description": "This course uses history as a lens to examine the conduct of leadership and statecraft. John Robert Seeley told his students that history is 'the school of statesmanship'. R.G. Collingwood wrote that historical insight enables us to see 'the tiger in the grass'. And Thucydides intended his history to be a possession 'for all time'. Reflecting seriously upon historical examples offers many profound insights into the dilemmas involved in political decision-making. Students will range widely, examining the impressive possibilities and acute limitations of 'the lessons of history'; explore a set of important case studies of modern statecraft (principally in the United States and Great Britain); and ponder the practical skills involved in successful leadership.Content note: This course will expose students to a considerable variety of approaches in the fields of political and strategic history. Students taking the course need to be prepared to engage with historical actors on their own terms and grapple with ideas and movements with which they may personally disagree. Engaging with a diverse range of viewpoints is integral to the study of History at a university. Seminars on the course often range widely, and discussion will proceed in a free and spontaneous fashion.",

    "summary": "Modern Western science has a number of characteristics that distinguish it from other scientific cultures. It ascribes its tremendous success to sophisticated experiments and meticulous observation. These unique achievements, so the current narrative goes, were the product of the 'Scientific Revolution' of the 17th century. In this course we will examine this premise and consider its supporters and detractors before turning to the way western science was exported to other countries, with particular reference to China and South America. This comparative perspective will allow us to assess and evaluate a number of historiographical issues that have engaged historians of science in recent years.",
    "course_description": "In the 1940s the influential Cambridge historian Herbert Butterfield argued that the Scientific Revolution \"outshines everything since the rise of Christianity and reduces the Renaissance and Reformation to the rank of mere episodes, mere internal displacements within the system of medieval Christendom.\" A number of historians since have vigorously challenged this grand narrative, while a minority of historians have enthusiastically revived it in recent years. This course will review the main aspects of this historiographical debate before analyzing key aspects of the Scientific Revolution in early modern Europe, and then broaden out to consider examples of the history of science in global perspective, focusing mainly on the period 1450 to 1800. Some representative topics may include, depending on the year: early scientific institutions, art and science, Renaissance natural history, science and religion, non-western knowledge systems, science and race, and so on.",

The history of interwar Europe will be a familiar story to many students.

This enables students to more fully contextualise the major developments in European history during this period.  The course will look to cover the legacy of the Great War, the survival and failure of democracy, the formation and fate of the 'Versailles system', the causes and consequences of the Great Depression, the establishment and nature of anti-democratic regimes, changes to interwar society and culture and the origins of the Second World War.",

    "course_description": "The course focuses on US foreign policy in the Cold War. Rather than being thematically and chronologically exhaustive, the programme singles out key events and historiographical controversies, such as the origins of the Cold War, crisis management, modernization theories, the Vietnam War, dÃ©tente, and the end of the Cold War. One of the central questions of the course is how the United States understood the dangers and challenges it was confronting, and what measures it devised in order to counter those threats. The course also contextualises these interpretations and foreign policy strategies with \"traditional\" US foreign policy and self-images in order to gain a broader understanding of how Americans interpreted their own role as global actor. In line with recent scholarship, the course also discusses in how far the Cold War intersected or conflicted with other important global developments in the 20th century, most notably the end of empires, decolonization, and development in the Global South. In order to analyse these questions, the course centers primary sources and provides the opportunity to approach the subject through the lens of different sub-disciplines and methodologies, e.g. cultural and gender history.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: war, violence and racial stereotyping. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

The course will focus on providing a basic solid grounding on the chronology, geography, society and political organisation of Egypt during this period. It will furthermore look to aspects of religion, daily life, and provide some insights into art and literature, particularly pertinent for the Middle Kingdom, the classic period of Egyptian literature. Discussion of recent theories and debates will be a key part of the MSc seminar that is additional to the lecture/seminar attended by MA students as well.",

The course will also promote familiarity with archaeological sites, and the history of their excavation, as well as bringing students into contact with artefacts through images, publications and museum collections online.Proposed course syllabus:1) Introduction to course aims and weekly topics. Overview of the natural and political geography of Egypt, her environment, and its importance for studying ancient Egypt. The origins of the Egyptian state. (The chronological framework - sources and limitations of the historical chronology.

    "course_description": "The 'dark century' has been illuminated by brightly shining ideologies. Nationalism, imperialism, fascism, communism, liberalism and other 'isms' have sometimes shaped, and often reflected, the most dynamic social and political forces of the century. One way to approach the 20th century is by following the now decayed paths and bridges between political thinking and the socio-political realities targeted by this thinking. This class will do so by studying and discussing the texts of one of Europe's best known, contested and famous political analysts and thinkers. Hannah Arendt combined a restless biography, clear-sightedness, unusual overviews, visionary moments, and a powerful style, with a capacity that was rather infrequent throughout the 20th century: independent thinking far from or against the mainstreams of their time. Reading Hannah Arendt (1906-1975) presents the 20th century in a different manner to modern textbooks. The work of Arendt has known an important renaissance throughout the last 20 years apart from an ever-growing intellectual universe even through several cinema adaptations. The seminar will discuss chosen key-phenomena (imperialism, anti-Semitism, racism, propaganda, total power) along with some of the more abstract concepts (freedom, acting, common decency, human rights). These terms are as central to Arendt's work as they are to any analysis of the 20th century. The readings will require students to engage with chapters from the original texts as well as with some of the more recent literature by historians. The class will also debate strengths and limits of intellectual history.",

    "summary": "This course offers an introduction to Greek ('Byzantine') literature of the Middle Ages. This literature, which used to enjoy a rather bad press is now becoming an increasingly popular and innovative field of scholarship. While until recently it was often characterised as a literature 'without any literary merit, without a public, without a drama, without historical accuracy, without a point', and indeed perceived as 'escapist, fantastic', and 'always at least one stage removed from reality', this was based on a gross misunderstanding of the historical and cultural circumstances in which this literature was produced. Over the past two decades, a younger generation of scholars has begun to assert their voices more confidently, moving beyond the modern dictate of 'originality' and promoting the appreciation of Byzantine literature and rhetoric on their own terms. All source texts will be read in English translation.",
    "course_description": "This course offers an intensive introduction to Byzantine literature and to provide criteria of how to interpret and analyse medieval literature critically and with attention to its historical and cultural conditions of production and circulation. The course, covering some eleven hundred and fifty years from the second sophistic and late antiquity to the end of the Byzantine empire in the early Renaissance period, must by necessity be selective. It offers a chronological survey of changing literary practices and tastes by throwing five spot-lights on seminal 'threshold' periods of Byzantine literary production, followed by five sessions devoted to current debates in scholarship.In the first part, the focus will be on the production of rhetorical texts of various genres in changing socio-historical settings: deigning deuterosophistic rhetoric - and its Attic models - and patristic writings as the 'archive' of Byzantine literature, the class shall survey the introduction of Christianity into public discourse; the construction and deconstruction of Christian imperial ideology; as well as issues of power/canonisation (who decides what is written, read, performed, preserved), propaganda (who sings the emperor's praises for which reasons?) and learning: how did Byzantine students become accomplished rhetoricians, and why would they have wanted to compose rhetoric in an 'artificial' sociolect (i.e, a socially conditioned form of language, as, e.g. opposed to a dialect) imitating the ancient Attic dialect? Participants are asked to browse excerpts from the sources in translation and read recent scholarship by means of preparation; at the beginning of every session, the instructor will provide a kick-off lecture summarizing the major trends and developments and presenting his ideas for discussion.In the second part, the focus will move to recent and current debates in the field. In this section, the focus is altogether more on recent and/or seminal secondary literature.1. Introduction. 'The archive': the sophists & the fathersI.

It is empirically oriented, and will draw on a wide range of textual and material evidence in order to gradually build up a working knowledge of the fine details of labour in a range of occupations, from crafts and services to retail and market gardening. It will also explore the role of the state in shaping economic life, in particular at Piraeus, where Athens' massive navy required a concentration of labourers not only to provide naval manpower, but in the provisioning of the navy and furnishing of its various raw materials.The citizen component of Athens' and Piraeus' working population exercised a disproportionate influence over democratic politics due to their proximity to the institutions of the state, and particularly the Assembly. This course will explore how the collective interests of these labourers were brought to bear in the quotidian operation of Athenian democracy.",

    "summary": "This course explores the history of engagement by women writers and artists with the place, idea, and myths of Greece. We first read ancient female writers -- preeminently Sappho -- and examine the representation of women in ancient texts; we then trace the multiple strategies through which \"Greece\" allows later women writers to assert their authority and authorship, question gender hierarchies and political/sociocultural paradigms, and lay a claim to the classical tradition. We consider how ancient writing affects contemporary understandings of identity and gender, and how modern works, from novels to plays to films, shape our view of the ancient world.",
    "course_description": "In \"Women, Writing, Greece\" we'll be looking at the history, influence, and reception of Greek literature through a female point of view. As we make our way through this history, the course will highlight the different perspectives and positions (in terms of gender identity, race, or even academic discipline and literary genre) from which women authors approach the \"classics.\" One important guiding figure throughout the course will be ancient poet Sappho, and the way in which her example informs -- even allows or authorizes -- later literatures, arts, identities, and sexualities; we'll be looking, for example, at the late-nineteenth-century Sapphic poems of \"Michael Field\" (joint penname of the lovers Katherine Bradley and Edith Cooper) and at the lesbian communities of Paris in the early twentieth century. By unraveling the complex gender and power dynamics of the past we will develop a better understanding of such issues in the present.We'll be thinking a lot about questions of access to a \"classical education\" -- as raised, e.g., by Virginia Woolf in A Room of One's Own and in \"On Not Knowing Greek,\" but also, in a different way, by the exceptional eighteenth-century example of the enslaved Phillis Wheatley or the nineteenth-century Greek writer Elisavet Moutzan-Martinengou. Similarly, we'll be thinking about who can claim a \"Greek\" identity, particularly through the examination of Modern Greek female writers. Consideration of translation, seen as a creative act but also often a gendered one, will form a large part of such conversations; all reading from languages other than English will be done in translation and we will be using female translators, examining their self-positioning towards Greek literature while also comparing selected excerpts with older and/or more traditional translations.",

We trace contacts between these courts, the exchange of objects and ideas, and the ensuing cultural rivalry and competition focusing on five themes: palaces as loci of power; those living in the palaces: rulers, their wives, and their courtiers (bearded, eunuchs); visitors from abroad: embassies and diplomatic gifts; objects and artefacts of court culture; medieval science as part of court culture.",
    "course_description": "In the (later) ninth and especially tenth centuries, interimperial competition (beyond the battlefield) and diplomatic exchange between the imperial courts of the early Islamic world and at Constantinople intensified; as Abbasid rule began to weaken, especially the Andalusian Umayyad court at CÃ³rdoba at the far end of the Mediterranan emerged as an ever closer contact for the Byzantine emperors. Embassies went to and fro, and with the ambassadors and their retinues, objects and ideas travelled, too.From a firmly comparative perspective, this course brings to life the courts at CÃ³rdoba and Constantinople and traces their diplomatic interactions and the cultural competition that ensued, before long, between them. Approaching these courts comparatively allows us to identify common features of early Islamic and Byzantine, and more generally medieval, court culture, and to throw the idiosyncracies of each culture into sharp relief. While the focus will be on CÃ³rdoba and Constantinople, further comparative glances will be thrown at other courts and cultures, especially the Abbasid court at Baghdad and courts of the Latin Middle Ages.The course is organised into five units, each lasting two weeks. The first week of each unit is dedicated to CÃ³rdoba, and the second to Constantinople. After an introduction that sets the ninth and tenth century Mediterranean scene, you will (1) start by studying the architecture and layout of palace buildings across the medieval Islamic and Byzantine worlds as loci of power, conceived and furnished as palatial stages for the lavish ceremonies that played out in them; (2) learn about the conditions of life in the palaces by looking closely at some of those who lived and worked in them: rulers and their wives, (bearded) courtiers and eunuchs in particular; (3) follow the embassies that went from CÃ³rdoba to Constantinople and vice versa and study, via the gifts they traded and the messages encoded therein, the language of medieval diplomacy; (4) closely analyze examples of artefacts and manuscripts produced for wealthy patrons at either court; (5) and, finally, explore the roles learning and science played at both the Islamic and Byzantine courts and, especially, in their vying for cultural superiority.The course introduces you to comparative historical analysis and to interpreting visual, material, and textual evidence from the medieval Islamic and Byzantine worlds. A visit to the National Museum of Scotland, to examine medieval Islamic and Byzantine artefacts, is part of this course.",

    "summary": "The course aims to consider the way in which the UK government dealt with the problems of the Scottish highlands in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The response of the people of the region lie at the heart of the course. The issues relating to the highlands will be treated in a comparative context.",
    "course_description": "In the immediate aftermath of the potato famine in the Scottish Highlands a Report on Highland conditions by Sir John MacNeill recommended that assisted emigration should be employed to deal with the 'surplus population of the region'. In 1953 a Commission of Enquiry into Crofting Conditions considered the issue of how to reform land tenure in order to revitalise the Highlands. Between these two dates the Scottish Highlands were one of the major issues in Scottish politics. The bulk of this course will consider the period from 1880 to c1925, encompassing the Crofters' War, the granting of security of tenure to Highland crofters and government attempts to place more land at the disposal of crofters. The main theme will be the variety of approaches adopted by governments of the period to cope with the problems presented by the Highlands. The background to the problems which the government perceived will be examined in depth. A key component of the course will be to place the developments in a wider context, for example, in terms of changes in landownership in Scotland and Britain, the relationship between the Highland land issue, party ideology and Westminster Politics, or the development of policy in other areas of the British Isles, e.g. Ireland or Wales, and the British Empire At the end of the course we will think about this historical material in the context of the current debate on land reform in Scotland.Content note: This course will expose students to a considerable variety of approaches in the field of the history of the Scottish highlands and appropriate comparative contexts, including, but not limited to, polemical debate, protests on the land question (sometimes violent) and depictions of scenes of eviction. Issues around the land question remain politically relevant in contemporary Scotland. Students may discover the involvement of previous generations of their family in some of the events dealt with in this course. Students taking the course need to be prepared to engage with historical actors on their own terms and grapple with ideas and movements with which they may personally disagree. Engaging with a diverse range of viewpoints is integral to the study of History at a university. Seminars on the course often range widely, and discussion will proceed in a free and spontaneous fashion.",

    "course_description": "This course examines the way Scotland was transformed in the period from the Stuart Restoration until the first quarter of the eighteenth century, not least as a result of its relations abroad. The self-conscious ways in which politicians, intellectuals and professionals expressed their concern with Scotland and its place in the world, both in relation to England, Europe and the emerging Atlantic empires, sets this period apart from the sixteenth and earlier seventeenth centuries, and arguably led to a pre-occupation with improvement. The course examines the interplay between challenges at home and the impact of the country's exchanges in people, goods and ideas, especially with the Continent. Amongst others, it looks at the language and intellectual underpinnings of such various projects of improvement as the quest for a Scottish colony, the reform of the universities, the development of the legal and medical professions and the Union debate.The course aims to:- develop an in-depth knowledge and an advanced, critical understanding of processes of modernisation and change in Scotland between c. 1660 and c. 1730;- deepen students' knowledge and understanding of early modern Scottish history;- develop students' skills and confidence in interpreting primary texts;- develop students' analytical, critical and communication skills, in both written and verbal forms.Topics and outline:Historiography; Restoration Scotland; Economic ambitions; Revolution; Political change; Civic aspirations; The Universities; Darien; Union; Post-Union Scotland; Improvement & Enlightenment",

    "summary": "The course compares the way in which the native 'Celtic' aristocracies of the British Isles responded to the political, economic and cultural pressures and opportunities created by the burgeoning power and ambition of the emergent 'national monarchies' of England and Scotland. Within this broad framework the course focuses on a number of specific themes such as the decay of native kingship, the success or failure of attempts at aristocratic integration, and the emergence of minority political cultures whose key features were a sense of decline and exclusion.",
    "course_description": "The course engages with the methodologies and conclusions of the wave of historical studies, pioneered by Rees Davies and Robin Frame, that address the history of the medieval polities of Britain and Ireland as an inter-connected whole rather than a series of discrete 'national' stories.  The course is organised into three sections, covering the relationship between 'Frankish' lordship, embodied in the post conquest English monarchy and aristocracy, and the nobility of Wales, Ireland and Scotland in turn. The Welsh section covers, inter alia, the rise of the thirteenth-century Princes of Wales and the rebellion of Owain Glyn Dwr. The Irish section examines the declining status of Irish kings after 1170, the notion of the so-called 'Gaelic Resurgence' of the fourteenth century, and the ambivalent role of and cultural identity of the 'English of Ireland'. The Scottish material looks at the Lordship of the Isles and the emergence of the idea of the Highlands. The course thus gives students the opportunity to consider the implications of the so-called 'New British History' for the study of medieval history in the British isles and Ireland.",

    "summary": "This course examines the origins, ideas and contexts of the Scottish Enlightenment.  After introducing the historical debates surrounding the Scottish Enlightenment, the course traces the impact of seventeenth-century philosophies in the development of eighteenth-century thought.  It then assesses the full spectrum of Scottish intellectual innovation, ranging from such fundamental subjects as knowledge and morals to history, science and the arts.",
    "course_description": "Why did Scotland become one of the leading centres of the eighteenth-century European Enlightenment?  This course allows students to examine the origins, ideas and contexts of what historians have called the 'Scottish Enlightenment'.  The course pays particular attention to the legacies of seventeenth-century thought in eighteenth-century Scotland, and studies the social and cultural changes that shaped the careers of such thinkers as David Hume, William Robertson and Adam Smith.  There is an emphasis on the close reading of primary texts, in extracts reflecting the wide range of contemporary attitudes and ideas.After an introductory week in which students consider problems of definition and causation, the course introduces a series of contexts.  These contexts are both intellectual - the impact of the thought of Bacon, Newton, Locke and Montesquieu - and social and institutional.  In weeks 5-11, the course surveys a large range of Scottish thought.  Each week, a range of short extracts illustrating a particular theme is specified.  The course is structured as follows:Week 1: The debate about the Scottish EnlightenmentWeek 2: Intellectual contexts 1: Bacon and NewtonWeek 3: Intellectual contexts 2: Locke and MontesquieuWeek 4: Social and institutional contextsWeek 5: KnowledgeWeek 6: MoralsWeek 7: Religion and mannersWeek 8: History and politicsWeek 9: The progress of societiesWeek 10: Aesthetics and literatureWeek 11: Science and the natural world",

    "course_description": "This course explores the history of that iconic era, the 1960s. It examines the myths and stereotypes of the 'swinging sixties' and seeks to understand how and why it became and remains such a mythologised, celebrated and contested era. The course covers a range of topics, including affluence, permissiveness, secularisation, class, race and immigration, and the growing significance of youth in society. A number of key social, cultural, economic, and political shifts are identified and explored in order to assess both continuity and change during the 'long sixties' (c. 1956-1974). Throughout the course, students will reflect on the dominant narratives and images found in the historiography of the sixties and evaluate these against evidence, examples and key case studies from around Britain. Did permissiveness reach Scotland, for example? Were youths in working-class communities as affluent as commentators believed? Did Britain 'swing'? The course will also explore how the 1960s were (and continue to be) represented in the media, film and wider popular culture and thus will draw upon film and television footage, photographic material and newspaper clippings alongside other historical sources in order to critically analyse the 'swinging sixties'.Content note: The study of History inevitably involves the study of difficult topics that we encourage students to approach in a respectful, scholarly, and sensitive manner. Nevertheless, we remain conscious that some students may wish to prepare themselves for the discussion of difficult topics. In particular, the course organiser has outlined that the following topics may be discussed in this course, whether in class or through required or recommended primary and secondary sources: social inequality and social change, sex and sexuality including contraception, race and racism, feminism and sexism. While this list indicates sensitive topics students are likely to encounter, it is not exhaustive because course organisers cannot entirely predict the directions discussions may take in tutorials or seminars, or through the wider reading that students may conduct for the course.",

    "course_description": "Since the Second World War, culture and the arts have occupied increasingly visible and important roles in Scottish society. The introduction of state funding for the arts through the Arts Council of Great Britain, increased leisure time arising from a range of wider social and economic changes, and effects of the upheavals and challenges of the 1960s resulted in culture becoming a significant part of local and Scottish-national government policy. During the same period, the arts became a crucial space in which to test out, express and challenge ideas about and representations of Scots and Scotland. This class explores culture and the arts in relation to changing practices of the arts and ideas about the role of culture in society, broader social change, and debates around Scottish national identity. The first part of the class explores key concepts, themes and developments in culture and the arts in the period c. 1945-1997, including the creation and development of cultural policy, the challenges and upheavals of the 1960s, and the growing use of culture in urban regeneration and city branding. The second part of the class applies these understandings to examples of the arts in practice, with students having the opportunity to examine a range of dramatic performances, theatres, visual arts, films and television programmes, and arts festivals. By exploring these interactions between the arts and society, students will develop new perspectives on the history of post-war Scotland.",
