The teaching is organised thematically, covering the phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics of English as the principal components of linguistic structure.1. Phonology: introduces some key ideas from phonological theory within the broader context of the study of linguistic structure. Material will consider some of the main characteristics of the phonology of English and will present some of the central concepts in phonological analysis.2. Morphology: explores some central aspects of the morphological structure of English words, examining some of the traditional elements of morphological analysis.3. Syntax: presents syntactic properties of major constructions in English, including a thorough grounding in syntactic structure.4. Semantics: develops a logical analysis of the meaning of English sentences and its relationship to syntactic structures.",

They will also develop an understanding of systematic variability of speech sounds in a variety of contexts, and will learn how to use transcription to indicate similarities and differences among (categories of) sounds.  In the lab reports, students will develop their written communication skills, and learn how to adapt their writing style to the structure of a report. Students will need to be respectful of other languages and cultures as they explore phonological concepts from across the world. Students will also learn how to use and analyse data which comes in different formats than what they might be used to. Students learn a key skill in how to use excel (inputting data, creating graphs, complete statistical tests), and use it to analyse the data theyÂ¿ve received.Core skills gained on this course:Data collection, data analysis, excel skills, using software, cultural sensitivity, clear written communication, report writing, problem solving, trying new techniques, critical analysis, considering alternate perspectives, initiative, independence, research skills, being open-minded.",

It addresses issues of theory construction more broadly and in linguistics specifically, methods in the study of typological variation, and approaches to explanation. In particular, the course considers the tension between 'grammar-internal' and 'grammar-external' explanations in linguistic theory, with reference to questions of innateness, emergence of linguistic structure, domain-specificity of linguistic knowledge, the role of processing ease and other psycholinguistic factors, the importance of developmental data, and diachronic/historical explanations for patterns of linguistic diversity.In addition to these overarching questions, the course also equips students with knowledge and skills related to the description and theoretical analysis of specific phenomena in a diverse range of languages.",

In this course, you'll become familiar with the principles of cognitive linguistics and the central areas of inquiry in the field. These include subjects such as:- language as a cognitive network- usage-based approaches to language structure- categorisation and prototypicality- frequency effects and entrenchment- metaphor and metonymy- idioms and constructionsYou will also learn a system of analysis that is consistent with the principles of cognitive linguistics, which is known as Word Grammar. Each week you'll learn more about the principles of Word Grammar, and how to analyse data using that framework. As you develop this skill, you'll learn more about the relationship between language and general cognition, and come to a better understanding of what our capacity for language tells us about being human.",

    "course_description": "This course covers basic high-level concepts of computer programming in general and practical training for writing code in the Python language in particular. The goal is for students to learn to think in terms of computational approaches for solving problems, and then to implement those approaches by writing Python code.We begin with the basics of computation (e.g. what is a computer? what can it do? how can a question be framed in computational terms?), and then move on to studying the tools that Python offers us as programmers for most of the semester (e.g. data structures, flow control, file input and output, object oriented design, regular expressions and other useful modules, etc). Examples and test problems are frequently taken from the context of speech and language processing, and we focus specifically on processing text and speech audio using Python for a week respectively.The course does not assume prior experience with Python or any other programming language, so is suitable for beginners in that regard. Note, however, it aims to teach students enough Python to write varied and useful programmes by the end, so the pace must be fast to cover all the required topics. It can be challenging for a beginner to build up the necessary knowledge and skill in the space of a single semester.  Sustained commitment to several hours of study and practice each and every week is therefore essential.",

    "course_description": "Students will explore a range of contexts which represent different patterns of contact with English and different outcomes. Typical case studies include Singapore, India, Nigeria, South Korea and China. In each of these situations, there is a code which has become associated with a pan-ethnic or national identity. This may be a creole such as Nigerian Pidgin English, a substrate influenced English such as Colloquial Singapore English or Â¿SinglishÂ¿, or dense code-mixing such as Hindi-English code-mixing (Â¿HinglishÂ¿) in India. In contexts without a long colonial period of contact this emergent code is restricted to certain media e.g. K-pop, or Â¿translanguagingÂ¿ in Chinese social media. Use of these codes can be mapped onto salient local distinctions in class, education, and global outlook. Students will initially produce a focused literature review on their chosen context, and then for their final project they will analyse the use of English together with other languages in a chosen medium, usually film, music or social media.",

    "course_description": "This course provides students with the opportunity to become more familiar with theories and/or methods in a particular subdiscipline of Linguistics and English Language. It serves as an 'umbrella' course for a number of seminars, each of which will be run by a member of the LEL academic staff. Students are required to choose one of these seminars. Since these seminars will vary (depending on staff availability and research interests), the precise details of each seminar will be made available via the Honours handbook. Although the topics will vary, the principles behind the course and the means of assessment remain the same in each case. The principles are as follows: to introduce students to key concepts and/or methods in a particular area within the discipline of Linguistics and English Language; to enable students to become familiar with current research in that area; and to prepare students to undertake their own research in that area, should they wish to. The course is not associated with formal lectures, though students will have regular meetings with the academic member of staff leading the seminar. The number of contact hours is lower than with other Honours courses, as a higher proportion of the work for the seminar (compared to a standard Honours course) will involve independent study on the part of the student. It is envisaged that the course should provide useful preparation for dissertation work in the subdiscipline, but students are equally encouraged to take this course at any stage of their Honours study, and to select a seminar topic that does not relate to their anticipated or current dissertation topic.",

Since these seminars will vary (depending on staff availability and research interests), the precise details of each seminar will be made available via the Honours handbook. Although the topics will vary, the principles behind the course and the means of assessment remain the same in each case.

The course is not associated with formal lectures, though students will have regular meetings with the academic member of staff leading the seminar. The number of contact hours is lower than with other Honours courses, as a higher proportion of the work for the seminar (compared to a standard Honours course) will involve independent study on the part of the student. It is envisaged that the course should provide useful preparation for dissertation work in the subdiscipline, but students are equally encouraged to take this course at any stage of their Honours study, and to select a seminar topic that does not relate to their anticipated or current dissertation topic.",

Languages are never stable but ever changing; this brings home SaussureÂ¿s notion of Â¿the arbitrariness of the signÂ¿, i.e. the lack of an intrinsic relationship between a linguistic form (in oral languages, a specific sequence of sounds) and a particular meaning. Instead, meanings are attributed to forms purely by convention, and conventions can, and do, change. Even if meanings are stable, changes in linguistic forms happen in ways that are not random but shaped by other systems - by the limitations of the articulatory system, by acoustic effects, or, in the case of morphology and syntax, by human cognition. The course provides a survey of the various ways in which languages may change, which challenges ingrained, unquestioned, and often implicit beliefs that some languages or varieties are intrinsically better than others. Instead, languages or varieties will be seen to acquire prestige and status as the result of social and economic factors, rather than because of any intrinsic characteristics of the linguistic forms themselves. This may help students get a clearer sense of what drives their own reactions to hearing accents that are different from their own, and hence their judgements of other people that are based solely on their speech.Core skills gained or developed on this course:Challenging own perspectives and assumptions; Critical thinking; Critical analysis and evaluation; Data analysis and evaluation; Ethics and research ethics; Formulating original arguments and justifying it; Academic reading skills; Research skills; Understanding broader perspectives; Written communication; Writing clearly and concisely.",

    "summary": "This course looks at linguistic and philosophical issues concerning the nature of word meaning, arguably one of the most intractable and controversial topics in linguistic theory. Beginning with the standard view of sense as sets of meaning relations between words, the course explores problems posed by the interaction of syntactic constructions and meanings, the vagueness inherent in certain word meanings, the context dependence involved in interpreting polysemous meanings and finally looks at whether words as isolated forms really can be considered to have any semantic meaning at all.",
    "course_description": "This course explores the semantics and pragmatics of words: what they can mean; how their meanings can be described; and how their meanings can change in context. It starts with a look at the nature of lexical relations and whether they can furnish us with a theory of word meaning and then goes on to explore some of the linguistic controversies surrounding word meaning: the differences in meanings expressed by content words and grammatical words; the nature of events described by words; argument alternations; homonymy, polysemy and vagueness. Philosophical conundrums are also explored such as the nature of causation in word meaning; whether word meanings are atomic or decomposable; whether any exhaustive definition of a word's meaning is possible in principle; and the pragmatics of lexical meanings.",

    "summary": "In this course, students gain expertise in methodologies that enable them to study linguistic phenomena first-hand, using data that they themselves collect from a native-speaker consultant and then proceed to process and analyse. Through sessions with a native speaker of an unfamiliar language, the students experience the stages of discovery, confusion, and hypothesis-testing that are inherent to the study of undocumented language phenomena. The lectures and the readings support this process, by offering insight into a wide range of language structures at different levels of the grammar.The course covers the following general topics: (1) approaches and issues in fieldwork data collection; (2) analysing the sound system of an unfamiliar language; (3) analysing the morphology, syntax, and semantics of an unfamiliar language. These topics are explored through lectures, data collection sessions with a native speaker consultant, readings, and two project papers.",
    "course_description": "There are two main components to this course: data collection sessions (two classes per week) and discussion sessions (one class per week).The data collection sessions with a native speaker consultant form the backbone of this course. Active participation is essential here. Initially, students take turns eliciting data from the speaker. It is the responsibility of each student to plan their data collection, and to analyse the data. These sessions will be recorded, and the data will be made available to all students after the session. The class works together to process, store, and distribute the data. Towards the end of the course, students work with the speaker to analyse a naturalistic text in the target language, which complements the elicited data.In the discussion sessions, the class meets without the native speaker consultant. The format of these sessions varies, depending on what challenges the data present. For example, we might discuss possible analyses of the data, formulate hypotheses, and plan what data we could collect to choose between competing hypotheses. Sometimes there may be mini-lectures on a particular phenomenon that we have come across in the target language, to help guide students in their analysis of the data.The classes are supplemented by additional weekly readings, which will help to broaden and deepen studentsÂ¿ skills in data collection and analysis.",

With respect to inflection, the various classes of inflection that we see cross-linguistically will be discussed, and phenomena such as syncretism, multiple exponence, and agreement will be analysed. The relation of morphology to other components of grammar (syntax, phonology and semantics) will also be discussed. The general outlook will be a formal theoretical one, but no particular conception of morphology will be singled out to the exclusion of discussion of others.

We show that a great deal of phonetic variability can be explained through an understanding of phonological structure, and that phonological questions can be answered using phonetic data. We explore these issues through the study of the the phonetic realization of a) constituent structure and b) suprasegmental contrasts.",

In LEL2B, students have learned about acoustic representations, and gotten a first experience with making measurements on these. That basic level expertise forms the foundation of the practical component of Phonetics & Laboratory Phonology, where it will be developed in a number of ways. Students will explore issues of experimental design, process audio recordings using Praat software, and learn to automate acoustic measurements, in part or in full, depending on the nature of the measurement. In the process, they will learn how to script within the Praat software environment. For many this will be their first experience with programming.

Building on concepts such as phonemes and distinctive features, students will become familiar with architecture of generative phonology (the notion of phonological computation, underlying and surface representations) and elements of phonological analysis (segments, various approaches to featural structure including models of feature geometry, syllabic, moraic and foot structure, stress, tone etc.). The course uses data from a broad range of typologically diverse languages to make students aware of the range of cross-linguistic variation in phonology, introduce relevant analytical concepts, and provide training in their use for phonological analysis. Students will also become familiar with some key questions bearing on the interaction of phonology with other components of the language faculty and with important theoretical controversies (markedness, abstractness, phonological and phonetic representations etc.).Over the course of the semester, students will work with scholarly literature to extract information regarding the phonological patterns of a language of their choice.

This course considers and reconsiders many of the major phonological phenomena found in varieties of English (segmental inventories, syllabic structure, realisational processes, stress and foot-based generalisations) in order to better understand them. In doing this, we will always have an eye on (i) the issues that arise when we deal with the variation that exists between the 'varieties' of a 'language', and (ii) general issues in theoretical phonology. We will thus investigate both a number of characteristics of the accents considered (mainly from England, Scotland and North America) and also a number of crucial concepts from phonological theory (opacity and rule ordering, featural phonology, extreme phonotactics, foot-structure).",

It provides students with an opportunity to acquire a reading knowledge of Old English, together with a command of central aspects of its grammar.  In addition, they will learn to transcribe passages from facsimiles of Old English manuscripts, and they will prepare a 'student edition' of one such short passage.",
    "course_description": "The course will start by concentrating on the rapid acquisition of essential basic grammar, consolidated through exercises, and on the translation of short passages of simple Old English prose. Once the basics are in place, the level of difficulty and length of the passages will increase. Less central aspects of the grammar will be dealt with gradually, over the course of the semester. At this stage, we will also begin with work on transcribing and analysing Old English from facsimiles of manuscripts, which will alternate with the translation work using printed texts.",

Students will need to take responsibility themselves for learning paradigms as and when these are introduced in the grammar covered in the course, which will involve practising self-discipline.  The course is linguistically focused and includes developing abilities to analyse Old English data morphologically and syntactically rather than just the ability to translate it.  The work with facsimile material provides additional challenges that will encourage a willingness to review initial assumptions and to explore alternatives.Core skills gained or developed on this course:Preparation, planning and organisation; Time management; Workload management; Data analysis and evaluation; Challenging own perspectives and assumptions; Diligence",

It should be completed by all undergraduate students who plan to conduct a research project, prior to the submission of their ethical protocol for panel review by the LEL Ethics Committee. The course introduces students to the complex issues around the ethics of conducting research with live, human participants, and further guides students in the planning and organization processes of linguistic research. Competency in research ethics is of increasing professional importance, and the entirety of the course constitutes a valuable transferable skill.The course is specifically aimed at Dissertation students, but it can be completed by any undergraduate student who is expecting to undertake an individual research project that involves ethical considerations, even if the project is for coursework. The decision of whether or not a student should take the training module is up to the instructor or supervisor, whichever is more relevant to the situation.The module contains some information about what research ethics is and then asks the student to take a couple short quizzes to gauge comprehension. Once the students have passed those quizzes satisfactorily, they are guided through questions related to the ethical considerations of their specific research project. Students can take the quizzes as many times as they need to. For students who approach the task fully prepared, it is expected that the total completion of the module should take no more than an hour.",

Although the main focus of this course is the structural properties of signed languages, students will also gain a basic familiarity with secondary topics such as the history of sign languages, variation in sign language, the acquisition of sign languages and cross-linguistic comparison of sign languages.The main text for the course is The linguistics of British Sign Language by Sutton-Spence & Woll (see bibliography below).N.B.  This is not a practical introduction to BSL.  Students need have no prior knowledge of BSL or other sign language to take this course.  However, students may find it advantageous to devote some time to learning some basic BSL independently, for example by attending an introductory BSL course or using online materials.",

    "course_description": "The study of the origins and evolution of language has seen a resurgence of interest in recent years. Part of the reason for this has been the application of new techniques from computer modelling to test out different hypotheses about how language is learned and evolves. This allows researchers to run experiments on populations of simulated individuals, essentially rerunning competing proposed scenarios for the evolution of language.In this course, we will build and run experiments with very simple models that nevertheless cast light on a wide range of puzzles - from how we learn word meanings, to how the language faculty evolves. Each of these models will build on the previous ones and at each step we will relate the practical work we are doing with the existing literature on simulating language, as well as broader issues in the scientific understanding of the origins and ongoing evolution of language.This course will be suitable for anyone interested in the dynamic processes underpinning language, including individual learning, cultural transmission, and biological evolution. It will involve a mix of practical work and lectures.Experience of programming (using any language) would be an advantage, but is not a prerequisite. Students will be shown how to modify pre-existing simulation models (written using Python notebooks), and in the process learn the skills to eventually run their own simulation experiments.",

    "graduate_attributes_and_skills": "This course trains students to build and run computational models that test a range of linguistic theories including language learning, change, and evolution. This is done primarily through the use of already coded models. The course trains students to understand existing code and how it works. In some cases, the models need to be tweaked slightly which requires students to be brave enough to explore and change pre-existing code. Labs guide students through this exploratory approach. There is a lot of emphasis on learning by doing in the labs, and also in figuring out ways to visualise the results of running models in such a way as to support or disconfirm central theoretical ideas in linguistics and cognitive science more broadly. The lectures build on labs and vice versa, and students are expected to be able to express the relationship between theories on the one hand, and models on the other. Writing is expected to be both concise and precise, with the emphasis on using model results and visualisations to support arguments. The course builds a complete theoretical model for the evolution of language piece by piece over the semester, with every part of the course relying on understanding of the previous parts so students will learn to manage their time in order to develop their modelling skills in step with the lectures.Core skills gained or developed on this course:Adapting presentation or writing tone/style to audience; Being open to different perspectives; Challenging own perspectives and assumptions; Critical thinking; Critical analysis and evaluation; Data analysis and evaluation; Enhanced programming/coding skills; Preparation, planning and organisation; Problem solving; Academic reading skills; Research skills; Resilience; Statistical analysis; Time management; Workload management; Written communication; Writing clearly and concisely; Data visualisation; Model building",

The instructions are deliberately somewhat under-specified, to encourage students to develop their own independent preparation, planning, organisation, and execution skills. The assignment is written up in the style of a journal paper.Core skills gained or developed on this course:Critical thinking; Critical analysis and evaluation; Data collection; Data analysis and evaluation; Enhanced programming / coding skills; Independence; Preparation, planning and organisation; Problem solving; Academic reading skills; Report writing; Research skills; Resilience; Time management; Workload management; Written communication; Writing clearly and concisely; Group work (delegation, influencing, conflict resolution, motivating others, taking responsibility)Critical reading of recent research publications, Scientific writing, following a journal style guide, Designing and implementing an original algorithm, Using a professional recording studio, Experimental design, including the use of human subjects for perceptual testing.",

The aim of the course is to combine a descriptive survey of some of the core constructions of English, with an exploration of current syntactic theory as it can be used to analyse these phenomena.  It deals mostly with syntax, touching on morphological and semantic issues as necessary, and is intended both to provide students with the background necessary to approach the primary literature and to give them experience in developing skills in data analysis and syntactic argumentation.",
    "course_description": "In trying to make a syntactic theory work, we are looking to see how we can create a restrictive framework which allows us to model (accurately and parsimoniously) the various phenomena of the language or languages that we are exploring. In the early years of modern syntax, all manner of new phenomena were discovered in English which hadn't, before, been noticed let alone analysed. Several of these constructions now number among the core problems of modern linguistic theory, and in this course we shall explore a number of these constructions. To give an example, we shall explore issues in English data such as why we can say \"He bought a car and drove a motorbike\" but not \"*what did he buy and drive a motorbike\" when we can say both \"he bought a car and drove it\" and \"what did he buy and drive\". Such issues do not only exist in the phenomena, though: they need to be analysed and understood, and it so we shall also investigate how modern linguistic theory accounts for the various phenomena that we explore, and set out to understand what a theory should be able to do, what might falsify a proposal, and how we can set about evaluating competing analyses.",

Students taking this course will already be familiar with a number of important syntactic phenomena and with some of the important concepts and terms that make it possible to describe the syntax of human languages in a precise way, and to understand descriptions in the current literature.  In this course we will be building on these foundations, in order to gain an understanding of how researchers have tried, and are trying, to address questions such as: What is a possible syntactic system? What are the primitives of syntax? How different can the syntax of one language be from the syntax of another?The course will set out in a systematic way a generative approach to these questions, with the aim of bringing students to the point at which they will be able to begin to read, in a critical way, the primary literature in the field. At the same time, there will be an emphasis throughout on understanding how hypotheses about syntax - syntactic analyses - are developed, tested, compared, and evaluated.",

Across two assessments, students will independently develop a concise written proposal for a novel piece of research and then work in groups to develop a subset of these proposals into a written mock journal article. This course therefore develops a range of skills including academic reading, writing, and research skills as well as planning, time and workload management, in the context of both independent and group work.Core skills gained or developed on this course:Being open to different perspectives; Challenging own perspectives and assumptions; Critical thinking; Critical analysis and evaluation; Formulating original arguments and justifying it; Group work (delegation, influencing, conflict resolution, motivating others, taking responsibility); Independence; Preparation, planning and organisation; Academic reading skills; Research skills; Understanding broader perspectives; Written communication; Writing clearly and concisely; Workload management; Time management.",

    "course_description": "This course covers basic high-level concepts of computer programming in general and practical training for writing code in the Python language in particular. The goal is for students to learn to think  in terms of computational approaches for solving problems, and then to implement those approaches by writing Python code.We begin with the basics of computation (e.g. what is a computer? what can it do? how can a question be framed in computational terms?), and then move on to studying the tools that Python offers us as programmers for most of the semester (e.g. data structures, flow control, file input and output, object oriented design, regular expressions and other useful modules, etc). Examples and test problems are frequently taken from the context of speech and language processing, and we focus specifically on processing text and speech audio using Python for a week respectively.The course does not assume prior experience with Python or any other programming language, so is suitable for beginners in that regard. Note, however, it aims to teach students enough Python to write varied and useful programmes by the end, so it must move fairly  quickly to cover all the required topics. It can be challenging for a beginner to build up the necessary knowledge and skill in the space of  a single semester, and therefore sustained commitment to several hours of study and practice each and every week is essential.",

We are going to focus, in particular, on two types of naturally-occurring discourse-spoken (e.g. small talk, professional interaction, media interviews, etc.) and computer-mediated (e.g. text and multimedia messaging, social media postings, etc). The course will cover three main components:1.\tWhat is discourse and discourse analysis: introducing key concepts in discourse analysis such as written vs. spoken discourse, small d and big D discourse, cohesion, turn-taking, etc.;2.\tWhat are the main approaches to discourse analysis: e.g. Conversation Analysis, Interactional Sociolinguistics, Computer-mediated Discourse Analysis, Critical and Multimodal Discourse Analysis, Corpus-assisted Discourse Analysis;3.\tHow to design and carry out a discourse analysis project: the ethical and practical considerations of collecting spoken, text messaging and social media data in different contexts, transcribing spoken and multimodal data, analyzing naturally-occurring discourse data adopting one of the main DA approaches.The course is highly hands-on. The students will learn to apply linguistic skills they have learned in this and other courses to examine real-life questions.",

They will receive practical sessions on how to access resources, and how to manage data. There will be a strong emphasis on group work and cohort building throughout.Outline Content:Approximately half of the contact hours will be dedicated to the dissertation process. This will include sessions such as the following:Overview of the dissertation process and timelineExamining past dissertations for structure and organisationDeveloping a research questionOverview of available topics and supervisorsPutting together a proposalThe writing up processManaging your supervisionManaging your timeThe other half of the contact hours will be data-oriented. This will include sessions such as the following:Data collection methodsEthics and ethical approvalData managementSpreadsheets in LinguisticsManaging your data through codingOnline resources and reference managersStatistics in MSc dissertations Â¿ deciding whether you need statistics and where to get itDisseminating your research and public engagementStudent Learning Experience:There will be a strong emphasis on building connections within the cohort, and therefore groupwork will be an important part of these training sessions.

Students will choose one of an array of topics (each linked to a research interest of a member of the department) as their focus for this course. Having become familiar with the basic concepts, they will then go on to develop a better understanding of the main theoretical and/or methodological issues associated with research in that field, by following a set of guided readings and/or practical exercises. This will enable students to be better prepared to undertake research in the discipline.",
    "course_description": "This course provides students with the opportunity to become more familiar with theories and/or methods in a particular subdiscipline of Linguistics and English Language. It serves as an 'umbrella' course for a number of seminars, each of which will be run by a member of the LEL academic staff. Students are required to choose one of these seminars. Since these seminars will vary (depending on staff availability and research interests), the precise details of each seminar will be made available online. Although the topics will vary, the principles behind the course and the means of assessment remain the same in each case. The principles are as follows: to introduce students to key concepts and/or methods in a particular area within the discipline of Linguistics and English Language; to enable students to become familiar with current research in that area; and to prepare students to undertake their own research in that area, should they wish to. The course is not associated with formal lectures, though students will have regular meetings with the academic member of staff leading the seminar. The number of contact hours is lower than with other 10-credit MSc courses, as a higher proportion of the work for the seminar (compared to a standard course) will involve independent study on the part of the student. It is envisaged that the course should provide useful preparation for dissertation work in the subdiscipline, but students are equally encouraged to take this course at any stage of their study, and to select a seminar topic that does not relate to their anticipated or current dissertation topic.",

Through sessions with a native speaker of an unfamiliar language, the students experience the stages of discovery, confusion, and hypothesis-testing that are inherent to the study of undocumented language phenomena. The lectures and the readings support this process, by offering insight into a wide range of language structures at different levels of the grammar.The course covers the following general topics: (1) approaches and issues in fieldwork data collection; (2) analysing the sound system of an unfamiliar language; (3) analysing the morphology, syntax, and semantics of an unfamiliar language. These topics are explored through lectures, data collection sessions with a native speaker consultant, readings, and two project papers.",
    "course_description": "There are two main components to this course: data collection sessions (two classes per week) and discussion sessions (one class per week).The data collection sessions with a native speaker consultant form the backbone of this course. Active participation is essential here. Initially, students take turns eliciting data from the speaker. It is the responsibility of each student to plan their data collection, and to analyse the data. These sessions will be recorded, and the data will be made available to all students after the session. The class works together to process, store, and distribute the data. Towards the end of the course, students work with the speaker to analyse a naturalistic text in the target language, which complements the elicited data.In the discussion sessions, the class meets without the native speaker consultant. The format of these sessions varies, depending on what challenges the data present. For example, we might discuss possible analyses of the data, formulate hypotheses, and plan what data we could collect to choose between competing hypotheses. Sometimes there may be mini-lectures on a particular phenomenon that we have come across in the target language, to help guide students in their analysis of the data.The classes are supplemented by additional weekly readings, which will help to broaden and deepen studentsÂ¿ skills in data collection and analysis.",

We explore these issues through the study of the the phonetic realization of a) constituent structure and b) suprasegmental contrasts.",

We assume that students taking this course will have an understanding of acoustic representations, and gotten a first experience with making measurements on these.That basic level expertise forms the foundation of the practical component of the current course, where it will be developed in a number of ways. Students will explore issues of experimental design, process them using Praat software, and learn to automate acoustic measurements, in part or in full, depending on the nature of the measurement. In the process, they will learn how to script within the Praat software environment. For many this will be their first experience with programming.",

    "summary": "The general area of this course is the relation between phonology (i.e., the system of sound contrasts, as well as their ordering, groupings, and relative prominence within a planned utterance), and phonetics (the realization of utterances in articulation and acoustics). We show that a great deal of phonetic variability can be explained through an understanding of phonological structure, and that phonological questions can be answered using phonetic data. We explore these issues through the study of the the phonetic realization of a) constituent structure and b) suprasegmental contrasts.",
    "course_description": "The goal is not just to offer insight into this topic area, but also to equip students with the skills and expertise to carry out research independently, for example in an MSc dissertation project. We assume that students taking this course will have an understanding of acoustic representations, and gotten a first experience with making measurements on these.That basic level expertise forms the foundation of the practical component of the current course, where it will be developed in a number of ways. Students will explore issues of experimental design, process them using Praat software, and learn to automate acoustic measurements, in part or in full, depending on the nature of the measurement. In the process, they will learn how to script within the Praat software environment. For many this will be their first experience with programming.",

Building on concepts such as phonemes and distinctive features, students will become familiar with architecture of generative phonology (the notion of phonological computation, underlying and surface representations) and elements of phonological analysis (segments, various approaches to featural structure including models of feature geometry, syllabic, moraic and foot structure, stress, tone etc.). The course uses data from a broad range of typologically diverse languages to make students aware of the range of cross-linguistic variation in phonology, introduce relevant analytical concepts, and provide training in their use for phonological analysis. Students will also become familiar with some key questions bearing on the interaction of phonology with other components of the language faculty and with important theoretical controversies (markedness, abstractness, phonological and phonetic representations etc.).Over the course of the semester, students will work with scholarly literature to extract information regarding the phonological patterns of a language of their choice. The assessment will require them to present this data, offer an analysis and provide theoretically informed discussion of any issues that it raises.",

This course considers and reconsiders many of the major phonological phenomena found in varieties of English (segmental inventories, syllabic structure, realisational processes, stress and foot-based generalisations) in order to better understand them. In doing this, we will always have an eye on (i) the issues that arise when we deal with the variation that exists between the 'varieties' of a 'language', and (ii) general issues in theoretical phonology. We will thus investigate both a number of characteristics of the accents considered (mainly from England, Scotland and North America) and also a number of crucial concepts from phonological theory (opacity and rule ordering, featural phonology, extreme phonotactics, foot-structure).",

It provides students with an opportunity to acquire a reading knowledge of Old English, together with a command of central aspects of its grammar. In addition, they will learn to transcribe passages from facsimiles of Old English manuscripts, and they will prepare a student edition of one such short passage.",
    "course_description": "The course will start by concentrating on the rapid acquisition of essential basic grammar, consolidated through exercises, and on the translation of short passages of simple Old English prose. Once the basics are in place, the level of difficulty and length of the passages will increase. Less central aspects of the grammar will be dealt with gradually, over the course of the semester. At this stage, we will also begin with work on transcribing and analysing Old English from facsimiles of manuscripts, which will alternate with the translation work using printed texts.",

The completion of training is required for the submission of an ethical protocol for review by the PPLS Ethical Review Panel.The course introduces students to the complex issues around the ethics of conducting research with live, human participants, and further guides students in the planning and organizing skills of linguistic research. Competency in research ethics is of increasing professional importance, and the entirety of the course constitutes a valuable transferable skill.The module contains some information about what research ethics is and then asks the student to take a couple of short quizzes to gauge comprehension. Once the students have passed those quizzes satisfactorily, they are guided through questions related to the ethical considerations of their specific research project. Students can take the quizzes as many times as they need to. For students who approach the task fully prepared, it is expected that the total completion of the module should take no more than an hour",

Linguistics has been twinned with semiotics throughout its history, and in this course the focus is on linguistic semiotics, broadly defined.

    "summary": "In this course, we will build and run experiments with very simple models that nevertheless cast light on a wide range of puzzles - from how we learn word meanings, to how the language faculty evolves. Each of these models will build on the previous ones and at each step we will relate the practical work we are doing with the existing literature on simulating language, as well as broader issues in the scientific understanding of language development, and the origins and ongoing evolution of language.",
    "course_description": "The study of the origins and evolution of language has seen a resurgence of interest in recent years. Part of the reason for this has been the application of new techniques from computer modelling to test out different hypotheses about how language is learned and evolves. This allows researchers to run experiments on populations of simulated individuals, essentially rerunning competing proposed scenarios for the evolution of language.In this course, we will build and run experiments with very simple models that nevertheless cast light on a wide range of puzzles - from how we learn word meanings, to how the language faculty evolves. Each of these models will build on the previous ones and at each step we will relate the practical work we are doing with the existing literature on simulating language, as well as broader issues in the scientific understanding of the origins and ongoing evolution of language.This course will be suitable for anyone interested in the dynamic processes underpinning language, including individual learning, cultural transmission, and biological evolution. It will involve a mix of practical work and lectures.Experience of programming (using any language) would be an advantage, but is not a prerequisite. Students will be shown how to modify pre-existing simulation models (written using Python notebooks), and in the process learn the skills to eventually run their own simulation experiments.",

The course will cover topics including language, gender, and sexuality; language, politics, and ideology; language and social identity (age, gender, class, region); language contact; and multilingualism. Students will gain an overview of foundational and contemporary theoretical and methodological developments in the field.",
    "course_description": "This course introduces students to the study of language in society - Sociolinguistics - by exploring the social and cultural embedding of language. Students will have the opportunity to engage with diverse areas of sociolinguistic inquiry by exploring the social and linguistic constraints of language variation as well as the socio-political implications of language use in society. This will include consideration of how linguistic varieties are used by individuals in everyday life and also how those varieties are perceived by others. Readings will cover key issues and current debates in the field of sociolinguistics such as multilingualism, politeness, identity, code-switching/mixing, translanguaging, and style-shifting.Throughout the course, there is an emphasis on collaborative learning. You are expected to participate fully in discussions in the class, and occasionally to present material to the class as a whole. Students will be particularly encouraged to apply the course concepts to novel datasets and reflect critically on their own sociolinguistic experiences. The content of this course is intended to provide students with a strong grounding in a research area that complements 'Language Variation and Change' (LASC11141).Assessment will include a written assignment and a short research project.",

    "course_description": "This course will give students the opportunity to acquire in-depth knowledge of the structure of a selected language and to build their skills in linguistic analysis and in communicating specialist information to a variety of audiences. Students will be provided with the support and resources that will enable them to engage in the analysis of textual or other kind of material in the target language. Students will be able to develop their understanding of the language's structure and relevant grammatical concepts, and to apply this knowledge as they engage with a varied set of data. Coupled with additional readings, this will enable them to gain an in-depth understanding of the language's structure, as well as to engage, as appropriate, with relevant sociolinguistic, historical, and cultural context as well as the diachronic development of the language.The choice of language will vary from year to year: information will be provided in advance to allow students to make an informed choice.The course will be focused primarily on developing structural understanding rather than practical mastery of the language; students will be required to engage closely with linguistic theory throughout the course. Students should expect a significant independent study component in preparation for the teaching sessions.",

Students taking this course will already be familiar with a number of important syntactic phenomena and with some of the important concepts and terms that make it possible to describe the syntax of human languages in a precise way, and to understand descriptions in the current literature. In this course we will be building on these foundations, in order to gain an understanding of how researchers have tried, and are trying, to address questions such as: What is a possible syntactic system? What are the primitives of syntax? How different can the syntax of one language be from the syntax of another?The course will set out in a systematic way a generative approach to these questions, with the aim of bringing students to the point at which they will be able to begin to read, in a critical way, the primary literature in the field. At the same time, there will be an emphasis throughout on understanding how hypotheses about syntax-syntactic analyses' are developed, tested, compared, and evaluated.",

When reading, students will learn how to read a text to fully understand and deconstruct the argument, and then assess its validity - bringing this skill to the assessment. They will continue developing their analytic skills, learning how to consider different sides and perspectives to an argument before deciding on their stance. Tutorials allow students to develop their ideas, test theories, discuss, debate and consider others' perspectives to cement their understanding of a theory. The tutorials may link the theories with contemporary social and political issues, which could be difficult for some students. They will learn how to manage their well-being and resilience when dealing with these topics. In the assessments students will develop their written communication and argumentation skill - being able to formulate their own argument and be able to justify it.Core skills gained on this course:Critical thinking, critical analysis, considering alternative perspectives, developing arguments/argument critique, looking for the wider context, being open minded, challenging assumptions, deconstructing complex theories, public speaking, discussing and debating respectfully, clear written communication, writing concisely, well-being management.",

It does not aim to communicate results about logical systems but instead it aims to impart a skill the ability to recognise and construct correct deductions and refutations. We will proceed via a graduated but unified development of logic from the basics of the sentential logic up to (monadic) predicate logic. Along the way we will take short diversions into the historical issues that led to various logical developments (e.g. the insights of Aristotle, the Stoics, Leibniz, Frege, Jaskowski, and Tarski).",

The students will learn about different approaches to philosophy developed by ancient Greek and Roman thinkers, will understand the differences between philosophical schools, and will critically examine some of the main ideas and arguments. Each week has its own set of readings which will be discussed in class and in the tutorial groups. The course will help to develop and perfect the students' analytical, presentation and writing skills. In particular, the work with ancient texts where the argument can often be reconstructed in several different ways, will help developing a clearer and more nuanced sense of the argument, which is useful as a background for future work in philosophy, but also has a great value as a transferable skill in many areas.Core skills gained or developed on this course:Being open to different perspectives; Challenging own perspectives and assumptions; Critical thinking; Critical analysis and evaluation; Formulating original arguments and justifying it; Independence; Oral communication (discussion, debating respectfully, influencing); Preparation, planning and organisation; Presentation skills ; Problem solving; Academic reading skills; Research skills; Resilience; Self-reflection; Taking initiative; Time management; Understanding broader perspectives; Workload management; Written communication; Writing clearly and concisely; Reading and analysing difficult and unfamiliar texts where some context or data can be missing: this takes the analytical skills to a new level and develops exegetical skills.",

His teachings spread throughout the vast continent of Asia (including Central, East, and Southeast Asia), and were critically appropriated by, while also shaping, many of the cultural, intellectual, and religious traditions and languages which had been flourishing in these regions. The historical development of Buddhist thought is complex, as is manifest in the rise and the fall of numerous schools, set against the backdrop of multiple intellectual traditions. Its significance for the formation of Asian cultures and philosophies cannot be overestimated. This course will focus on several specific themes in the history of Buddhist philosophy (the themes chosen may vary from year to year). This will allow students to pursue a two-fold objective: (1) to deepen their knowledge of the ways in which Buddhist thinkers articulated their problems (and, sometimes, solutions) in their distinct intellectual and historical contexts; (2) to engage in their own versions of Buddhist thinking by reflecting on, and responding to, these problems and the (possible) solutions proposed by philosophers in the multi-faceted history of Buddhism. This course does not require any previous knowledge in the area. All readings will be in English translation.",

The course content will demand students to think beyond the confines of Anglo-European philosophy, which for many of them would mean to going beyond their familiar social, cultural, linguistic, and even philosophy backgrounds, thus engaging in the intellectual EDI. They will also have an opportunity to cultivate this cross-cultural thinking inter-subjectively through a group presentation and to think about the real-life application of the acquired knowledge on Buddhism through research output. This course will prepare Year 4 students not only for a graduate program in humanities but also for the non-academic world in which they have to pursue their career with a degree in philosophy.Core skills gained or developed on this course:Adapting presentation or writing tone/style to audience; Being open to different perspectives; Challenging own perspectives and assumptions; Critical thinking; Critical analysis and evaluation; Data collection; Data analysis and evaluation; Enhanced programming / coding skills; Ethics and research ethics; Formulating original arguments and justifying it; Group work (delegation, influencing, conflict resolution, motivating others, taking responsibility); Independence; Oral communication (discussion, debating respectfully, influencing); Preparation, planning and organisation; Presentation skills ; Problem solving; Public speaking; Academic reading skills; Report writing; Research skills; Resilience; Self-reflection; Taking initiative; Understanding broader perspectives; Written communication; Writing clearly and concisely; Knowledge impact; Employability.",

    "summary": "This course will explore philosophical issues in consciousness studies, with particular attention to recent approaches that foreground the roles of life, biological organisation, and embodied activity in their explanations of the character or emergence of conscious experience. The first weeks of the course will introduce students to the functionalist and computationalist approaches to consciousness of the late 20th century, and the philosophical puzzles that those approaches raise. The remainder of the course will introduce students to several different approaches within recent science and philosophy of consciousness that emphasise the importance of life, activity, embodiment, or some combination of these, and consider whether and/or how they help us to explain how consciousness fits into the natural world.",
    "course_description": "How does consciousness fit into the natural world? Philosophical and scientific thinking about this question is in an exciting period of transition. The emergence of modern neuroscience and the computational theory of mind in the 20th century aroused hopes of a rigorous, scientifically-informed and materialist explanation of consciousness: what it is, how it arises, and what sorts of things have it. But that explanatory project appears to face stubborn in-principle obstacles - how can any amount of physical, structural, or functional information about a system tell us anything about what it is like to *be* that system? In recent years, theorising about consciousness has increasingly turned to considering its potential links to life - to the evolutionary history of conscious organisms, to the particular ways in which conscious organisms interact with their environments, to the distinctive organisational structure of living systems, or to some combination of these. In this course we will start by looking at the 20th century scientific and philosophical origins of consciousness studies, before turning to more recent 'biological' approaches and considering whether they make old philosophical puzzles about consciousness go away, or look easier. Readings will be a mixture of philosophy and accessible, philosophically-inflected, cognitive science. Each week, after a brief introductory presentation by the seminar leader, class time will be mostly devoted to group discussion of questions about the readings for that week.",

We expect to see significant changes in our society as AI systems become embedded in various aspects of our lives. This course will cover philosophical issues raised by current and future AI systems. Questions we consider include:- How do we align the aims of autonomous AI systems with our own?- Does the future of AI pose an existential threat to humanity?- How do we prevent learning algorithms from acquiring morally objectionable biases?- Should autonomous AI be used to kill in warfare?- How should AI systems be embedded in our social relations? Is it permissible to fall in love with an AI system?- What sort of ethical rules should a self-driving car use?- Can AI systems suffer moral harms? And if so, of what kinds?- Can AI systems be moral agents? If so, how should we hold them accountable?- Which ethical norms should we program into our AI, if any?",

The main questions we will consider are listed in the course summary. No previous familiarity with the literature on AI will be assumed.The classes will be primarily discussion based, so students are expected to have done the reading in advance of class. During class, students will work in small teams to answer a question (approximately 1 per team) based on the reading for the week. They may be instructed to argue for a particular case (pro or contra). They may be asked to assess the merits of a given view. They may be asked to look for counterexamples to a generalisation or fallacies with a specific argument. In second part of the class, we will come together to discuss what each group has achieved to see how it helps us to answer our questions.Topics covered in class:- Robot rights- AI existential threats- Biases in learning algorithms- Ethics of AI in warfare- Ethics of AI in self-driving cars- Moral harms to AI- Falling in love with AI- AI and future of human jobs",

    "summary": "The average person in industrialized societies will spend the equivalent of eleven years working during her lifetime, but work and labour are often marginalized in mainstream philosophical discourse. This course engages with fundamental philosophical questions concerning the nature and value or work, with a particular eye toward the state of work and labour in contemporary society. By considering both historically influential and present day sources, the course invites students to develop a more informed and reflective stance on their own working lives and the place of work and labour in community life.",
    "course_description": "Work is a formative human experience but has often received only sporadic attention from philosophers. This course uses historically prominent frameworks (ancient virtue ethics, the Protestant work ethic, Marxism, etc.) to motivate rival views about workÂ¿s nature and value, such as that work is a burden or a curse, a calling or vocation through which one develops and exhibits personal virtues, a purely instrumental means for acquiring income, etc. This investigation will enable students to articulate contrasts between work on the one hand and play or leisure on the other, as well as to consider different normative grounds for evaluating work (good work, virtuous work, meaningful work, etc.). The course also considers the morality of work, pursuing such questions as whether there is a duty to work, whether there is a right to work (for example, by way of a job guarantee) or a right to forego work, the right to strike, the ethics of choosing specific jobs or careers, productive justice and the societal allocation of Â¿badÂ¿ jobs, and the just distribution of power and authority within the workplace. Special attention will be given to how these questions intersect with race and gender. The course concludes by critically projecting alternative futures for work, including the possibility and desirability of a Â¿post-workÂ¿ future.",

    "course_description": "This course provides an introduction to the problems of free will and moral responsibility - some of the deepest and hardest (and most discussed) problems in all of philosophy.  Broadly speaking, the problems arise through reflection on what William James called 'the dilemma of determinism': if determinism is true, then it can seem that nothing we do is genuinely 'up to us', and accordingly that no one is fairly blamed or praised.  On the other hand, how does indeterminism help with free will and moral responsibility?  Wouldn't indeterminism simply imply that everything we do is a matter of chance or luck?  In short, the thought that we are free, responsible agents is arguably a fundamental aspect of our conception of ourselves and our place in the universe.  But is this conception indeed justified?  We will investigate the main contemporary theories regarding the relationships between free will, moral responsibility, and determinism. In this course, we will approach these problems through two key texts: Four Views on Free Will (edited by Manuel Vargas), and Susan Wolf's book, Freedom Within Reason.",

The seminar-based course is oriented around the discussion of focal works by mostly twentieth-century philosophers.  The guiding idea is that understanding these concepts provides insights into different constructions of legitimate government and political authority. We will consider each concept several times to understand the varieties of ways in which the concepts may be defined.  The course will begin with a discussion of the idea of political philosophy and conclude with a consideration of the extent to which the political can be treated separately from the moral where similar considerations of freedom, consent and obligation exist.",

In this course, we will look at the early history of this movement, as reflected in the works of Frege, Russell, and Moore.This tradition emerged from two trends. One trend was a rejection of the idealism that had become popular in philosophy in the 19th century. Idealism holds that the world is somehow dependent on our conception of it. Frege, Russell, and Moore each developed frameworks according which the world is objective, and is not altered by what we think about it. The other major trend was that philosophers sought to apply developments in logic and the study of language to traditional philosophical problems. Difficulties in understanding the foundations of mathematics led Frege and Russell to develop rigorous new ways of thinking about logic and language. These tools form the foundation of many developments in contemporary logic and linguistics.  But Frege and Russell went beyond the investigation of logic, mathematics, and language. We will see how these tools were put to use in understanding the structure of human thought and the world it represents, and in resolving scientific puzzles.This course will cover the philosophical climate in which these philosophers developed, their views on traditional philosophical issues, and the distinctive debates that arose within the emerging tradition.",

This will allow students to pursue a two-fold objective: (1) to deepen their knowledge of the way in which Japanese thinkers articulated their problems (and sometimes solutions) in their distinct intellectual and historical context; (2) to engage in their own versions of cross-cultural thinking by reflecting on, and responding to, these problems and the (possible) solutions proposed by philosophers in the history of Japan.This course will not assume any previous knowledge in the area.

The course will introduce students to the historical context of his work and its legacy, particularly the Essay's role as the most influential statement of empiricism in the early modern period. Students will also be exposed to early responses to Locke and contemporary secondary literature.",
    "course_description": "This class will offer a close reading of Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, with a focus on appreciating the aims and coherence of the work as a whole. Topics specifically addressed may include: Locke's arguments against innate ideas and innate knowledge; the nature of ideas; the primary-secondary quality distinction; our ideas of substance and of natural kinds; personal identity; language and meaning; the nature of knowledge; mathematical knowledge; perceptual knowledge; action and the will; knowledge of moral truths; probable judgment and the nature of probability; and, finally, Locke's contributions to political philosophy and their connection to his metaphysics and epistemology.Students will work on developing the skills necessary to interpret historical texts and will learn techniques and tools commonly used in the history of philosophy. In addition, students will learn how to read and carefully assess secondary literature, and to critically evaluate competing interpretations of primary sources. Finally, students will have the opportunity to do research in the history of philosophy, developing an original topic, formulating and defending a thesis, and making use of relevant secondary literature.",

    "course_description": "This course will focus on key metatheoretical results linking computability and logic. In particular, Turing machines and their formalization in first-order logic, linking uncomputability and the halting problem to undecidability of first-order logic. We will then study recursive functions and their construction, followed by  first-order formalizations of arithmetic, particularly Robinson arithmetic and Peano arithmetic. We will then turn to the topic of the arithmetization of syntax and the diagonal lemma, before proceeding to prove some of the main limitative results concerning formal systems, in particular G?del's two incompleteness theorems, along with allied results employing the diagonal lemma, including Tarski's Theorem and Lob's Theorem.",

These will include 'fitting attitude' analyses and interpretative analyses.-\tSubstantive theories of the meaning of life and meaning in a life, including theological/supernaturalist theories, narrative theories, and hybrid theories which blend subjective and objective elements (e.g. taking satisfaction in engaging with objectively valuable ends and projects).-\tThe phenomenology of meaning - what experiences go hand in hand with finding one's life meaningful - or, on the other hand, meaningless.-\tThe relationship between meaning in a life and achievement and goal-oriented activity (related: meaning in different stages of life and the idea of a 'mid-life crisis').-\tWhether evil lives can be meaningful.-\tWhether yearning for meaning in one's life can be pernicious and whether we might not be better off aiming for happiness and well-being and transcending our attempts to find meaning.The organization of these topics may vary from year to year.",

    "summary": "Philosophy of measurement is one of the fastest growing areas of philosophy of science.  Measurement is philosophically important as the locus where scientific theories make empirical contact with the world, and forms the lynchpin for any theory of scientific evidence.  More recently, the broader social importance of measurement, and its complex role in policy and the institutionalization of implicit value judgments has been recognized, critiqued, and philosophically reconceived.  Especially important examples here include educational testing, diagnosis of mental disorders, and large scale, policy determining measures of well-being, poverty, quality of life, and other value-laden concepts.",
    "course_description": "This course will introduce key debates in the philosophical foundations of measurement.  General topics covered will include the difference between scale types, the problem of nomic measurement, and the realism debate.  In addition to these general issues, more specific topics will be addressed, which may vary from year to year.  Possible further topics include: the epistemic significance of the New SI, which defines measurement units by fixing the values of physical constants; the metaphysics of quantities; the quantity objection in psychology, namely the worry that psychological attributes aren't conceptualized as quantitative, so cannot legitimately be measured; and the question whether ethical considerations on the measurement of thick concepts, such as well-being or poverty, require that measurement instruments are co-created by the subjects of measurement in collaboration with scientists.While exact topics may vary year to year, the course will always draw on examples from both the physical and human sciences and address debates that are distinctive to both kinds of scientific inquiry.",

The course builds on students' prior study of  core issues and theories. (For background, students are encouraged to consult chs. 0-1 and 6 of  M. Chrisman What Is This Thing Called Metaethics.) In addition to students interested in ethical theory, this course will be relevant to those interested in metaphysics, epistemology, and the theory of  meaning.",
    "course_description": "The precise topics for this course vary from year to year, as the intention is to introduce students to recent topics and cutting-edge research in the area. Some indicative topics are: (i) Is morality an ideology?, (ii) can there be pure moral testimony?, (iii) how does moral virtue relate to human nature?, (iv) can there be moral obligations without an authoritative lawgiver?, (v) what does it take to have the standing to make moral judgments?, (vii) whatÂ¿s the semantic relation between moral Â¿oughtÂ¿s and imperatives?, (viii) how to understand the content of  thick ethical concepts?, (ix) do evolutionary considerations debunk moral realism? We will sometimes focus on a specific author or set of  authors and seek to understand their metaethical views well.Please consult the course guide for precise topics for this year.The primary goal of  this course is to develop your critical and analytical thinking skills. You will also develop these skills through in-class discussion and by arguing in your written work for the ideas you find most persuasive and challenging ideas you think are incorrect. Excelling in the course will demonstrate your growing precision in thought, an ability to interpret a text charitably and reconstruct the arguments found in that text and critically engage with those arguments, the capacity to develop your own convincing arguments for theses you find plausible, and anticipate the most powerful objections to your arguments and counter them, among other core philosophical skills. The course should be especially useful in honing your ability to think comparatively about the relative costs and benefits of  various theories competing for roughly the same logical space.",

    "course_description": "This course introduces leading philosophical accounts of objectification, dehumanisation, and othering, and investigates the degree of overlap betThis course looks at three ways that certain behaviours, attitudes, institutions, representations, and ways of using language have been morally criticised. At a first approximation, to objectify is to treat or represent a person as a mere thing; to dehumanise is to treat or represent a person as lacking in humanity, for example, as animal-, insect-, or disease-like; while to treat someone as the Other is to enjoy and depend on their recognition of oneself as a subject, while failing to fully reciprocate this recognition. However, these initial characterisations leave crucial questions unanswered. ItÂ¿s left unclear what it is to treat people in these ways, in what ways such treatment might be morally problematic, and to what extent these three notions overlap (and whether weÂ¿re really dealing with three distinct notions here at all). Moreover, philosophers such as Kate Manne and Mari Mikkola have recently denied the significance of objectification and dehumanisation, while Nancy Bauer has questioned whether philosophers can say anything true and significant about them. This course introduces leading philosophical accounts of objectification, dehumanisation, and othering, and investigates the degree of overlap between the three notions. We will also examine scepticism about the moral, social, and philosophical significance of these notions, looking closely at a number of case-studies in order to assess the plausibility of this kind of scepticism. These case-studies will include pornography, epistemic injustice (Miranda FrickerÂ¿s term for ways in which one can be harmed in oneÂ¿s capacity as an epistemic subject), and the roles of dehumanising language and imagery in oppression and violence.",

    "summary": "Naturalism as a philosophical doctrine has no one precise definition. Minimally, naturalism suggests that philosophy should in some sense be guided by science, with different forms of naturalism offering a range of proposals as to what such guidance might entail. 'Naturalism' is widely viewed as a positive term, and that a view counts as naturalist carries great weight across diverse philosophical debates.This course will expressly interrogate the notion of naturalism itself, as well as the role that naturalism plays in a number of different debates. We will consider such questions as: What is the distinction, and relation, between ontological and methodological naturalism? What is the relation between naturalism and physicalism? What arguments are offered for different forms of naturalism? How do different conceptions of naturalism impact on realism/anti-realism debates across different areas of philosophy? What alternatives to naturalism have been proposed? What implications does methodological naturalism have for philosophy itself?",
    "course_description": "The aim of the course will be to consider and critically assess both the concept and different forms of naturalism. Naturalism as a philosophical doctrine has no one precise definition. At the same time, 'naturalism' is widely viewed as a positive term, and that a view counts as naturalist carries great weight across diverse philosophical debates. The term typically conveys some kind of connection with science. On the one hand there is the claim that we ought not to count as part of the content of reality things that are not somehow countenanced by science. There is no place in reality for \"spooky\" or \"supernatural\" entities. On the other, there is the claim that the scientific way of investigating reality is superior to all others. Both of these claims are philosophical claims and hence need to be subjected to philosophical scrutiny. Naturalism raises two broad groups of questions:(1) Questions about the relationship between philosophy and science: How might philosophy be guided by the sciences? Are science and philosophy methodologically continuous?(2) Questions about how to explain or accommodate entities and phenomena that are not obviously countenanced by science (e.g. some mental facts, normative and evaluative facts, mathematical facts, modal facts). Do they have to be reducible to natural (or physical) facts to count as natural and thus real?This course will engage both types of questions.Representative topics: ontological naturalism, methodological naturalism and the relation between them; physicalism, naturalism and the relation between them, reductive and non-reductive naturalism, different conceptions of naturalism (e.g. disciplinary, causal, Quinean); the relation between philosophy and science; naturalism in action in specific debates (e.g. ethics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of maths, modality)",

This will help them understand broader perspectives, as well as foster an understanding of the role of philosophy in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding. In tutorials, students will learn how to evaluate arguments for and against viewpoints, how to articulate cogent arguments;  how to allow themselves to be challenged by views they may disagree with. In preparation for tutorials, students are asked to read research articles and book chapters, which will help them learn how to critically read and analyse difficult texts and how to evaluate arguments for and against viewpoints. As this is a metaphilosophical course, this will include different viewpoints on philosophical methodology. Through the written assessments, students will learn how to write clear and structured arguments;  how to show an understanding of the materials;  how to formulate original arguments;  how to manage time and workload.Core skills gained or developed on this course:Challenging own perspectives and assumptions; Critical analysis and evaluation; Formulating original arguments and justifying it; Academic reading skills; Research skills; Resilience; Self-reflection; Time management; Understanding broader perspectives; Written communication; Writing clearly and concisely; Oral communication (discussion, debating respectfully, influencing); Preparation, planning and organisation; Reflecting on research methodology; Understanding the role of philosophy in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding",

These questions lie at the centre of the Philosophy of Action, a branch of philosophy that brings together issues in the philosophy of mind, metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics.The course will consider questions such as: If something is an intentional action, in virtue of the agent's comprehensions of the reasons for performing it, then how is irrational action possible? How are we to make sense of unconsciously motivated action and unfree action? How are we to make sense of alienation from action, and what does it take to identify oneself with one's actions in such a way that one thereby attains a sense of self?

This course will address questions such as the following. What is the metaphysical and epistemological status of the conception of the person employed in economic models? What is the subject matter of economics, if any? What distinguishes economic methodology from the methodologies of formal disciplines, empirical disciplines, philosophical disciplines? To what extent are economic theories value-laden? What is exchange? What is a market? What are the ethical limits or shortcomings with markets? What kinds of alternatives to markets are there? What is the practical significance of results in decision theory and game theory? To what extent can economics guide or be guided by political philosophy and moral philosophy?",
    "course_description": "The course will be divided into three main parts, each of which will be addressed, although the exact distribution of topics and the emphasis may vary in any given year.1. Methods and Epistemology of EconomicsThis part of the course addresses the distinctive metaphysical and epistemological questions concerning the nature and method of standard economic analysis. We will discuss questions such as: What is utility, and how do economists measure it? Does evidence of widespread `irrationality' from behavioural economics undermine standard microeconomic theory? Can idealised models teach us anything about real-world phenomena? If yes, how? How should we measure important economic variables, such as inflation? How do we best find out what interventions work in development? What is the practical significance of results in decision theory and game theory?2. Welfare EconomicsThe second area of focus is on welfare economics, and the ethical assumptions and implications of economics. We will cover questions such as: Is getting what you want always good for you? Can you be harmed by something if you never know about it? Does it make sense to say that eating pizza gives me more happiness than going to the movies gives you? Is it possible to combine the preferences of individuals into an overall 'social' preference? Does it matter if the well-being of some people is less than that of others? When and why are markets desirable? Is paternalism always bad, and does welfare economics really avoid it? How should we resolve collective action problems? What is a fair way to distribute the tax burden?3. Market and Non-Market SystemsWhat is exchange? What is a market? How do 'invisible hand' explanations work? What are market failures? Consider various market-based and non-market-based responses to market failures. What is the significance of the welfare theorems? What are property rights, and how do they differ from other kinds of rights, if at all? What is the labour theory of value? What might non-market-based economic systems be like?",

    "summary": "Friendship seems to be an indispensable part of a good life. We will discuss whether friendship is indeed necessary for a good life or whether it is possible for a solitary life to be a good life as well. If it is part of a good life, what precisely is its value? In addition to its value, we will discuss the nature of friendship. One crucial feature of friendship is the fact that it unites some, but not all, people and thus brings about a distinction between friends and non-friends. The partiality of friendship in this sense leads to problems with regard to the impartiality of rationality and of morality: We will discuss epistemic and practical tensions between friendship and rationality. We will also consider how moral theories that require impartiality deal with the partiality of friendship and ask whether conflicts between friendship and morality can be resolved by deontologists and by consequentialists.",
    "course_description": "In this course, we will explore a number of key issues in the philosophy of friendship. Typical topics will include: the nature of friendship; the unity and partiality of friendship; the relation between friendship and reason; the relation between friendship and morality. We will ask what role friendship has in a good life and whether it is necessary for a good life or whether it is possible for a solitary life to be a good life as well.Typical topics1. The nature of friendshipAristotle famously distinguishes between three kinds of friendship: friendship based on virtue, on usefulness, and on pleasure. Modern accounts find the foundation of friendship in such things as trust (Thomas 2013) or plural agency and interpersonal emotion (Helm 2009). We will discuss a number of competing accounts of what friendship is.2. The unity of friendshipWhat unites friends? According to Aristotle, a friend is another self; Montaigne goes further by claiming that a perfect friendship is kind of fusion where friends become one in a much stronger sense: The friend is no longer another self. Plato (Lysis and Republic V) and Helm (2009) think that the unity consists in common action and emotion.3. Friendship and reasonSince friends are united and since we cannot be friends with everyone, friendship brings about a distinction between friends and non-friends. Some philosophers see a tension between friendship and reason. One of these debates concerns the epistemic partiality of friendship. In certain circumstances, we tend to evaluate the same evidence differently depending on whether it concerns a friend or a non-friend. Some scholars argue that this sort of epistemic partiality is irrational (Slote (2013)) while others consider it rationally justifiable (Brown (2013)).4. Friendship and moralityMoral theories tend to demand impartiality. This leads to problems of the following sorts: First, from a moral point of view, we ought to treat our friends no different from our non-friends, but often giving preference to friends seems to be the right thing to do. Second, there is, as Williams (1981) points out, a problem of motivation. If I visit a friend in the hospital (as I ought to), wouldn't it be wrong to motivated by obeying a moral law or maximising goodness instead of just doing it because I care? Wouldn't being morally motivated be 'one thought too many'? We will discuss answers that defenders of the major moral theories give to such challenges.5. Friendship and the good lifeWhat is it that makes friendship good? Is this good necessary for a good life? Is there a specific value to friendship or is friendship valuable because it provides us with other generic goods (e.g. pleasure, virtue, or knowledge)? We will look at different theories of the value of friendship (e.g. Stoics, Hurka (2013)). We will also discuss whether there is an aesthetic value to friendship.",

    "summary": "This course examines different conceptual analyses of information and their implications for issues in cognitive science, epistemology, and internet ethics.  The material divides roughly into two units.  In the first unit, we cover the use of information as a foundational concept for grounding theories of knowledge and mental representation.  In the second unit, we examine the way ethical considerations are transformed by informational interactions, addressing questions such as: Do interactions in virtual realms (chatrooms, MMORPGs, Second Life) carry the same ethical obligations as physical interactions? How does the algorithmic structure of social media accelerate the spread of fake news? and How does generative AI change our perspective on human creativity?",
    "course_description": "This course addresses philosophical questions around information of two different kinds.  The first half of the course considers information as a passive resource flowing through nature, and thereby potentially grounding theories of knowledge, inference, and mental representation.  Topics covered in this unit of the course typically include Shannon information, semantic information, the distinction between natural and non-natural meaning, and the factivity (or not) of information.",

    "summary": "The aim of this course is to discuss topics in the Philosophy of Science for Honours students. In any year, it can cover various areas of the philosophy of science. Pre-honours Philosophy of Science 1 is not a prerequisite.In the mid-20th century new tools, such as X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy brought about a paradigm shift in biology by allowing scientists to look inside the cell and to understand life, not as a mysterious 'vital' force, but rather as the operation of complex molecular machinery Â¿ programmed by a genetic code and directed by the same forces that apply throughout all of the physical universe. The core targets of biology were no longer living organisms but rather the molecular units, such as genes, that compose them.  More recent developments, however, have called into question the tenability of this reductionist approach. This course will consider such developments, the extent to which they do or do not undermine accepted frameworks in biology, and what the prospects are for third-way between non-naturalistic 'vitalism' and reductionism in the science of life.Potential questions include:1) Is the genome best understood as a code, and, if not, what role does it play in the cell?2) Are organisms just 'evolved machines'? And, if not machines,  then what are they?3) Is cognition only an attribute of creatures with a nervous system?4) How do we identify biological individuals?5) To what extent do the experimental tools available to scientists constrain their theorizing?6) What are the limits of formal models when it comes to understanding living systems?",
    "course_description": "This course aimsa) To look at how philosophical tools can aid in the revision of scientific concepts and frameworks when they are rendered untenable by new empirical discoveries.b) To consider how these discoveries may also prompt a revision to more foundational philosophical theories, for instance regarding our understanding of individuality, agency, rationality, anthropocentrism, and the relation between models and reality.c) To consider real-world examples of the factors that either drive the revision of scientific concepts or guard them against revision in the face of new evidence.",

    "summary": "Philosophy of Science has historically been shaped by questions arising from the natural sciences, and in particular the physical sciences. By contrast, this course addresses philosophical questions arising from the distinctive methods and subject matter of the social sciences. How do social scientists go about finding out about the social world? What particular epistemological challenges do they have to confront? What is the ontological status of this social world? Do social entities simply reduce to natural entities? How do the values embedded in our social world shape social science? How should social science aim to shape this social world? This course provides the opportunity to engage with some of the diverse and controversial answers philosophers have given to these questions. Suitable case studies from different social sciences will be used to illustrate and motivate the philosophical questions.",
    "course_description": "The course will be divided into three main parts, each of which will be addressed, although the exact distribution of topics and the emphasis may vary in any given year.1. Methods and Epistemology of Social ScienceThis part of the course addresses the distinctive epistemological challenges arising from scientific research in the social sciences. The following is a representative list of topics, at least two of which will usually be covered:a) Experimentation: What are Randomized Controlled Trials and are they really the gold standard of evidence in social science? Can social experiments in the laboratory tell us much about human interactions in the wild?b) Measurement: We all know how to use a yard stick, but how do you measure intelligence, political freedom, or poverty, and what does it mean to do so?c) Replication: Is there a replication crisis in the social sciences? What might be the reasons?d) Modelling: How do social scientists build and reason with models?e) Data: How does the 'data revolution' affect the social sciences?2. Subject Matter and Metaphysics of Social ScienceThis part of the course addresses the distinctive epistemological challenges arising from scientific research in the social sciences. The following is a representative list of topics, at least two of which will usually be covered:a) Holism/Individualism: Are social groups and institutions just collections of individuals?b) Reductionism: Can the social sciences ultimately be reduced to the natural sciences? Are there even genuinely 'social' sciences?c) Classification: Are social kinds social constructs?d) Causation: What makes a correlation between two factors causal as opposed to spurious?e) Laws: Are there economic or psychological laws like there are laws in physics?3. Values and Ethics of Social ScienceThis part of the course addresses the distinctive epistemological challenges arising from scientific research in the social sciences. The following is a representative list of topics, at least two of which will usually be covered:a) Value neutrality: Can social science be value neutral? Should it be?b) Responsibility: Do social scientists have particular ethical obligations when choosing what research questions to pursue?c) Public Policy: How should social science inform public policies?d) Expertise: How does the expertise of social scientists relate to the self-knowledge of their subjects?",

    "graduate_attributes_and_skills": "This course will enable students to approach research coming from the social sciences with a critical mindset. They will be aware of important differences in the methods used by social scientists compared to natural sciences, which will allow them to evaluate information and results provided by social science research effectively and to communicate potential concerns clearly, both orally and in writing. Students will be able to engage critically with the contemporary philosophical literature on social science, and to connect it to particular examples of scientific research. They will be able to apply abstract philosophical reasoning skills to concrete problems arising in the social sciences.",

    "summary": "In this course we investigate the very concept of a game and the way in which games figure in the good life.  The primary text will be Bernard Suits' underappreciated masterpiece, The Grasshopper.  Written in the style of a Socratic dialogue, The Grasshopper attempts to turn the classic Aesop's Fable of the ant and the grasshopper on its head.  The dialogue opens with the Death of the Grasshopper, in which The Grasshopper is surrounded by his followers and explains why his ideas are worth dying for, and why the life of the ant is so deeply misguided even paradoxical.  The analogy with Plato's The Crito is unmistakable, and very well done.  Indeed, The Grasshopper is a masterpiece not only in terms of its philosophical content, but in terms of its literary style.  The opening chapter provocatively conveys the idea that playing games holds the key to a meaningful life.Suits engages directly with WittgensteinÂ¿s thesis that 'game' cannot be defined.  Wittgenstein admonishes us not to just assume there must be some definition in the offing but to look and see.  Suits takes him at his word, and looks much more carefully than Wittgenstein himself seems to have.  He carefully develops and defends his definition against a battery of objections from his interlocutors and then explains why the life of the Grasshopper, which consists in playing games rather than working, is superior to the life of the ant.  The dialogue concludes with some discussion of Utopia, in which the Grasshopper argues that the playing of games is a kind of master value for human beings which would play a central structuring role in Utopia.  Along the way, we consider an earlier essay by Suits in which he argues provocatively that life itself can usefully be understood as a kind of game.In addition to the central core of the course built around SuitsÂ¿ masterful work, we will also consider some of the more interesting uses to which the concept of a game, and the closely associated concept of a constitutive rule, in other areas of philosophy.  Here we shall focus mainly on two areas: moral philosophy and the philosophy of language.  In the former case, we consider the Kantian idea that the rules of morality are constitutive of rational agency in the same ways that the rules of a game (like chess) can be constitutive of playing the game. This, in turn, leads naturally into a discussion as to whether morality is well understood in terms of rules or principles at all.  In the latter case, we examine the metaphor of a 'language game,' compare this evocative metaphor with Mark Lance's metaphor of language as sport.  We also consider the ways in which the concept of a 'language game' can usefully structure a debate in applied ethics, feminist theory and political philosophy; namely, the debate over whether some forms of pornography subordinate women.",
    "course_description": "In this course we investigate the very concept of a game, the relationship between that concept and the concept of play, the way games figure in the good life and the normative role of games and play in Utopia.  We also discuss some of the more interesting uses to which the concept of a game, and the closely associated concept of a constitutive rule, have been put in other areas of philosophy - e.g. moral theory and the philosophy of language.  The aim is to bring insights from the philosophy of games proper to bear on the use philosophers working in other areas have made of the concept of a game.",

    "course_description": "Paradoxes have formed a central topic of philosophical investigation, stretching back from Zeno of Elea up to David Lewis. Paradoxes figure both in influential arguments for philosophical theses and in famous (alleged) refutations of philosophical theses. Bertrand Russell advised that one should \"stock the mind with as many puzzles as possible, since these serve much the same purpose [in philosophy] as is served by experiments in physical science\". This course provides an overview of a number of famous philosophical puzzles and paradoxes and important attempts to solve them. In so doing students will be introduced to some important issues in philosophy of language, philosophical logic, decision theory, and formal epistemology. The course will put emphasis on both methodology and philosophical content: (i) method: emphasis will be put on the deployment of logical and formal methods in the service of philosophical problems, (ii) content: the main philosophical themes will center around the nature of reference, truth, rational belief, and knowledge. The puzzles and paradoxes to be discussed include Russell's paradox, the liar paradox, the sorites paradox, Cartwright's paradox, Bhartrhari's paradox, Frege's puzzle, the puzzle of empty names, the surprise exam paradox, the paradox of knowability, the preface paradox, the St. Petersburg paradox, among others. With critical engagement as a primary goal the course sessions will be discussion oriented and include various peer-teaching activities.In addition to online papers reading will include the following books:- Sorensen (2005) A Brief History of the Paradox: Philosophy and the Labyrinths of the Mind, Oxford University Press.- Sainsbury (2009) Paradoxes, Cambridge University Press.",

What is truth in science? and why do experts disagree on scientific evidence? what good might relativism be? The course is structured in two Parts. In Part I, we read some classical texts (from Quine's ontological relativity, to Goodman's ways of worldmaking and Rorty's epistemic relativism, among others). Part II of the course zooms into contemporary debates on realism in science and on the values of truth, objectivity, disagreement and progress in scientific research.",

Is our scientific knowledge relative to different  principles endorsed by rival scientific communities? When it comes to allocating research funds for scientific programmes, what principles should guide policy-making?  Join this course to explore these cutting-edge questions for contemporary science.  The course will map the territory of the vast debate between realism and relativism in science, with a focus on both classic texts and more contemporary approaches.",

We will examine the mid-century decline of logical empiricism, and the canonical arguments in favour of realism. We will finish with an assessment of contemporary varieties of realism: structuralism (considering, in particular, its origins in neo-Kantian philosophy of science), perspectival realism, and recent attempts to align realism with a pragmatist approach to truth.Students will learn through independent reading of challenging historical texts, discussion of those texts in class, presentations delivered by the instructor, and student presentations.",

Moreover, epistemology has often pursued answers to these questions that abstract away from social context. In response, this course focusses on the ways social context is important for thinking about justification, knowledge, and understanding. We consider topics such as the role of testimony in transmitting and expanding knowledge within groups of people, the idea of aggregating judgment within a group to form a collective opinion and realise the possibility of common knowledge and group understanding , the challenge of identifying and relying on experts, the role of social-political structures in enhancing or detracting from individual and group knowledge and understanding, and the phenomena of echo chambers and epistemic bubbles in the formation of political beliefs.",
    "course_description": "Epistemology has traditionally focussed on individuals and asked what it takes for their beliefs to be justified, count as knowledge, and contribute to understanding. Moreover, epistemology has often pursued answers to these questions that abstract away from social context. In response, this course focusses on the ways social context is important for thinking about justification, knowledge, and understanding.The precise topics covered may vary year to year and depending on who is teaching, but they will typically include 3-4 of the following:1. Epistemology of testimony: Much of what we know comes from relying unquestioningly on the word of others, but not everyone is trustworthy. So does knowledge acquired through the testimony of require prior grounds for the reliability of the source, or is testimony a freestanding and fundamental source of knowledge. So here we consider various answers to this question.2. Judgment aggregation and the wisdom/stupidity of crowds: What does the jury think about the guilt of the defendant, what does the scientific community think about the truth of some hypothesis, what does the market regard as a fair price for the commodity? Questions like these require a theory of how to aggregate diverse views of some group in order to articulate the group's view. So here we investigate several theories of how to do this and consider some of the many challenges to doing so well.3. The challenge and importance of identifying experts: When forming beliefs about something complex and difficult, it is generally good to rely on the word of people that know more about the topic than you do, but how do you tell who the 'experts' are? And how can diverse expertise be integrated across various topics and fields, so that groups of people can advance their holistic understanding of multifaceted phenomena such as climate change, immigration, mental health, etc.? So here we evaluate several theories of expertise that seek to answer questions such as these.4. Social structures and the promotion/deterioration of knowledge and understanding: One of the mantras of the philosophical and political enlightenment of the 18th century was that people should throw off the shackles of indoctrination and take responsibility for thinking for themselves in order to become free. But we know that what and how one thinks is hugely influenced by family, educational, cultural, and economic factors. So here we examine what kinds of social structures promote/undermine more knowledge and understanding, both in individuals and groups.5. Democracy, markets, and knowledge: Generally, decisions based on knowledge are better than those based on ignorance. But voters in democracies are often thought to make their political decisions with relatively low levels of relevant knowledge, whereas consumers in capitalistic markets are often thought to make their economic decisions with relatively high levels of relevant knowledge (especially of comparative values and opportunity costs). Nevertheless, many would be loathed to say that market forces rather than political forces should be relied on for making collective decisions about how to live together. So here we explore this rich and thorny issue.6. Echo chambers, epistemic bubbles, and polarisation: The contemporary (social-) media landscape has been described as creating echo chambers, wherein one only hears others who have similar views to oneself. This can have the effect of intensifying one's political views and the confidence with which one holds them. But there is different phenomenon of epistemic bubbles whereby one hears views that disagree with one's own but all too quickly discounts their reliability because they come from sources whose trustworthiness has been undermined in some way by one's original source of information. This sometimes has the effect of perpetuating conspiracy theories or epistemic injustice. So here we examine these phenomena and consider what might be done to mitigate their bad effects.",

    "course_description": "People do not typically live as isolated individuals, but as part of larger social groups; families, communities, groups, and societies. This may seem like an obvious point, but some areas of philosophy have been accused of neglecting our fundamentally social nature, and of failing to treat this as worthy of philosophical attention in its own right. Social philosophy treats our socially-embeddedness as something which philosophers should explore and try to understand, and also as a crucial starting point for philosophical inquiry. It includes areas such as feminist philosophy, critical race theory, philosophy of race, and philosophy of disability, but social approaches in areas like ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, political philosophy, and the philosophies of language and mind. For example, social metaphysics asks what social groups are, how social practices categorize people, and what ethical and political consequences follow, and social epistemology looks at the ways in which we can gain knowledge from others through testimony, how we can identify experts, how our views can be challenged by disagreement with others, and the distorting effects of systems of oppression, prejudices, and ideologies on what people do or don't believe and what they do or don't know. This topics-based course introduces student to issues in social philosophy, either generally or through attention to particular social groups. The precise focus of the course within social philosophy will shift from year to year, depending on the interests and expertise of the course organiser.",

Despite the wide range of issues addressed in Lewis' work there is a unifying method and systematicity.

Examination of the work of Spinoza and Leibniz will allow us to assess the degrees to which they succeeded in this quest, examining how, for instance, the metaphysical monism of Spinoza leads to a necessitarianism that poses difficulties for individual ethical agency and freedom and how Leibniz sought through his metaphysical pluralism to overcome these problems.",

    "summary": "We will examine how the methodologies of philosophy and psychology have been deployed to investigate how we - human subjects - experience and think about time, and how we conceptualise our lives and experiences as themselves unfolding over time. Given the wide interest in time and temporal cognition across disciplines, our topics will also overlap with research undertaken in metaphysics, ethics, and economics.- Students will be expected to engage critically with the main arguments and findings of the selected texts, and to articulate their own views of the relative strengths and weaknesses of these proposals.",
    "course_description": "This module begins by discussing problems concerning our distinctly temporal experiences - i.e., experiences of motion and change - looking at historically significant contributions (Locke, Reid, James) and contemporary points of debate (Prosser, Phillips, Grush). This will broadly range over points of debate concerning our experience of, and the profile of our experience in, time; students will benefit from an multidisciplinary focus, as relevant philosophical and empirical work will be drawn upon. While remaining on the topic of 'temporal experience', we will consider how appeal to aspects of our temporal experience has been put to work in debates in aesthetics - concerning the presentation of appearances of motion/change in still and moving images. In the second half of the course, consideration will be given to issues of inter-temporal choice, concerning temporal asymmetries in hedonic preferences, their (ir)rationality, and competing explanations of their origins. Again, multidisciplinary work in philosophy, psychology, and behavioral economics will be discussed. Finally, a couple of weeks will be spent discussing influential appeals to temporal experience in the context of metaphysical debates about time, requiring students to connect work concerning temporal experience with other relevant work in philosophy.",

They may be instructed to argue for a particular case (pro or contra). They may be asked to assess the merits of a given view. They may be asked to look for counterexamples to a generalisation or fallacies with a specific argument. In second part of the class, we will come together to discuss what each group has achieved to see how it helps us to answer our questions.Some representative topics include:-\tCan AI systems have agency? Can they be responsible for their actions?-\tWhen is using AI good or bad for someone's personal wellbeing?-\tIs AI a threat or an opportunity for democracy?-\tDo future AI systems pose an existential threat to humanity?-\tShould we focus on existing ethical problems with AI, or more speculative future issues?-\tWhat is algorithmic bias, and what can be done about it?-\tDo current or potential future AI systems think?-\tDo Large Language Models (LLMs) mean what they say?-\tCan AI be truly creative?-\tWhat is the ethical status of AI therapists, or AI lovers?",

    "course_description": "People do not typically live as isolated individuals, but as part of larger social groups; families, communities, groups, and societies. This may seem like an obvious point, but some areas of philosophy have been accused of neglecting our fundamentally social nature, and of failing to treat this as worthy of philosophical attention in its own right. Social philosophy treats our socially-embeddedness as something which philosophers should explore and try to understand, and also as a crucial starting point for philosophical inquiry. It includes areas such as feminist philosophy, critical race theory, philosophy of race, and philosophy of disability, but social approaches in areas like ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, political philosophy, and the philosophies of language and mind. For example, social metaphysics asks what social groups are, how social practices categorize people, and what ethical and political consequences follow, and social epistemology looks at the ways in which we can gain knowledge from others through testimony, how we can identify experts, how our views can be challenged by disagreement with others, and the distorting effects of systems of oppression, prejudices, and ideologies on what people do or don't believe and what they do or don't know. This topics-based course introduces student to issues in social philosophy, either generally or through attention to particular social groups. The precise focus of the course within social philosophy will shift from year to year, depending on the interests and expertise of the course organiser.",

    "course_description": "Decision theory systematizes the connection between belief, desire, and rational choice, very roughly, that rational agents act in a way that would bring them closer to satisfying their desires if the world were as they believe it to be. After introducing the basic framework of decision theory, this coursewill focus on two questions. First, does rationality impose constraints on what an agent may believe or desire, and if so, what are these constraints? Second, can we turn around the principles of decision theory and define (or explicate) an agent's beliefs and desires in terms of their choices?Decision theory has proved useful in many areas of philosophy, from philosophy of science to epistemology to political philosophy. Unfortunatelythe literature is often difficult and technical. A central aim of this course is to isolate the simple ideas behind those technicalities.",

    "course_description": "Buddhism is based on the teachings of Siddhartha GautamaÂ¿the BuddhaÂ¿who lived in Northern India approximately 2500 years ago. His teachings spread throughout the vast continent of Asia (including Central, East, and Southeast Asia), and were critically appropriated by, while also shaping, many of the cultural, intellectual, and religious traditions and languages which had been flourishing in these regions. The historical development of Buddhist thought is complex, as is manifest in the rise and the fall of numerous schools, set against the backdrop of multiple intellectual traditions. Its significance for the formation of Asian cultures and philosophies cannot be overestimated.This course will focus on several specific themes in the history of Buddhist philosophy (the themes chosen may vary from year to year). This will allow students to pursue a two-fold objective: (1) to deepen their knowledge of the ways in which Buddhist thinkers articulated their problems (and, sometimes, solutions) in their distinct intellectual and historical contexts; (2) to engage in their own versions of Buddhist thinking by reflecting on, and responding to, these problems and the (possible) solutions proposed by philosophers in the multi-faceted history of Buddhism.Â¿This course does not require any previous knowledge in the area.

We will unpack the arguments of these texts and critically assess the views they put forward. This will lead us to explore topics like:Â¿\tHuman nature: Are humans inherently selfish, inherently altruistic, or something else? What role does culture play in shaping who we are?Â¿\tVirtue: How can we become better people? What would the mind of a truly wise person be like? Do feeling and emotion play an important role?Â¿\tIneffability: Can the bounds of good ethical conduct be conveyed through language? Can the nature of reality? If not, then what role (if any) can philosophy play in helping us to grasp them?The course does not assume any previous knowledge in the area. All reading will be in English translation.",

We expect to see significant changes in our society as AI systems become embedded in various aspects of our lives. This course will cover philosophical issues raised by current and future AI systems. Questions we consider include:- How do we align the aims of autonomous AI systems with our own?- Does the future of AI pose an existential threat to humanity?- How do we prevent learning algorithms from acquiring morally objectionable biases?- Should autonomous AI be used to kill in warfare?- How should AI systems be embedded in our social relations? Is it permissible to fall in love with an AI system?- What sort of ethical rules should a self-driving car use?- Can AI systems suffer moral harms? And if so, of what kinds?- Can AI systems be moral agents? If so, how should we hold them accountable?- Which ethical norms should we program into our AI, if any?",
    "course_description": "The aim of this course is to introduce students to a range of ethical issues that arise regarding current and future artificial intelligence (AI). The main questions we will consider are listed in the course summary. No previous familiarity with the literature on AI will be assumed.The classes will be primarily discussion based, so students are expected to have done the reading in advance of class. During class, students will work in small teams to answer a question (approximately 1 per team) based on the reading for the week. They may be instructed to argue for a particular case (pro or contra). They may be asked to assess the merits of a given view. They may be asked to look for counterexamples to a generalisation or fallacies with a specific argument. In second part of the class, we will come together to discuss what each group has achieved to see how it helps us to answer our questions.Topics covered in class:- Robot rights- AI existential threats- Biases in learning algorithms- Ethics of AI in warfare- Ethics of AI in self-driving cars- Moral harms to AI- Falling in love with AI- AI and future of human jobs",

We expect to see significant changes in our society as AI systems become embedded in various aspects of our lives. This course will cover philosophical issues raised by current and future AI systems. Questions we consider include:- How do we align the aims of autonomous AI systems with our own?- Does the future of AI pose an existential threat to humanity?- How do we prevent learning algorithms from acquiring morally objectionable biases?- Should autonomous AI be used to kill in warfare?- How should AI systems be embedded in our social relations? Is it permissible to fall in love with an AI system?- What sort of ethical rules should a self-driving car use?- Can AI systems suffer moral harms? And if so, of what kinds?- Can AI systems be moral agents? If so, how should we hold them accountable?- Which ethical norms should we program into our AI, if any?",
    "course_description": "The aim of this course is to introduce students to a range of ethical issues that arise regarding current and future artificial intelligence (AI). The main questions we will consider are listed in the course summary. No previous familiarity with the literature on AI will be assumed.The classes will be primarily discussion based, so students are expected to have done the reading in advance of class. During class, students will work in small teams to answer a question (approximately 1 per team) based on the reading for the week. They may be instructed to argue for a particular case (pro or contra). They may be asked to assess the merits of a given view. They may be asked to look for counterexamples to a generalisation or fallacies with a specific argument. In second part of the class, we will come together to discuss what each group has achieved to see how it helps us to answer our questions.Topics covered in class:- Robot rights- AI existential threats- Biases in learning algorithms- Ethics of AI in warfare- Ethics of AI in self-driving cars- Moral harms to AI- Falling in love with AI- AI and future of human jobs",

    "summary": "The course covers the main issues in the philosophical debates about freedom, determinism, and moral responsibility. Among the more specific topics that may be addressed: Formulations of determinism; historical responses; Frankfurt style examples (designed to show that moral responsibility for an action does not require the ability to act differently); Strawson's account of the reactive emotions; compatibilist theories about the nature of responsibility and freedom; moral luck; the difference between excuses and justifications; the relevance of ignorance; collective responsibility.",
    "course_description": "This course provides an introduction to the problems of free will and moral responsibility - some of the deepest and hardest (and most discussed) problems in all of philosophy. Broadly speaking, the problems arise through reflection on what William James called 'the dilemma of determinism': if determinism is true, then it can seem that nothing we do is genuinely 'up to us', and accordingly that no one is fairly blamed or praised. On the other hand, how does indeterminism help with free will and moral responsibility? Wouldn't indeterminism simply imply that everything we do is a matter of chance or luck? In short, the thought that we are free, responsible agents is arguably a fundamental aspect of our conception of ourselves and our place in the universe. But is this conception indeed justified? We will investigate the main contemporary theories regarding the relationships between free will, moral responsibility, and determinism. In this course, we will approach these problems through two key texts: Four Views on Free Will (edited by Manuel Vargas), and Susan Wolf's book, Freedom Within Reason.",

It offers independent solutions to many philosophical problems which remain crucial for contemporary readers. Starting with a historical overview of the most important figures and schools, this course covers central topics of Islamic philosophy, such as (the selection of topics may vary from year to year):- faith and reason- philosophy and political authority- free will and determinism (incl. the problem of evil)- scientific knowledge and empiricism- materialism (atomism) and sortal essentialism- self-awareness, personal identity, and the immateriality of soul- proofs for God's existencePrimary sources will be read in English translation.",

Modern Japanese philosophy also engages with an influx of Anglo-European philosophical concepts against the backdrop of East Asian traditions. The upshot of this is that the emergence of many philosophical concepts in the intellectual history of Japan has been shaped, to a greater or lesser degree, by some form of cross-cultural thinking.This course will focus on one such theme in the history of Japanese philosophy (the theme chosen may vary from year to year). This will allow students to pursue a two-fold objective: (1) to deepen their knowledge of the way in which Japanese thinkers articulated their problems (and sometimes solutions) in their distinct intellectual and historical context; (2) to engage in their own versions of cross-cultural thinking by reflecting on, and responding to, these problems and the (possible) solutions proposed by philosophers in the history of Japan.This course will not assume any previous knowledge in the area.

These will include 'fitting attitude' analyses and interpretative analyses.- Substantive theories of the meaning of life and meaning in a life, including theological / supernaturalist theories, narrative theories, and hybrid theories which blend subjective and objective elements (e.g. taking satisfaction in engaging with objectively valuable ends and projects).- The phenomenology of meaning - what experiences go hand in hand with finding one's life meaningful - or, on the other hand, meaningless.- The relationship between meaning in a life and achievement and goal-oriented activity (related: meaning in different stages of life and the idea of a 'mid-life crisis').- Whether evil lives can be meaningful.- Whether yearning for meaning in one's life can be pernicious and whether we might not be better off aiming for happiness and well-being and transcending our attempts to find meaning.The organization of these topics may vary from year to year.",

    "summary": "Philosophy of measurement is one of the fastest growing areas of philosophy of science.  Measurement is philosophically important as the locus where scientific theories make empirical contact with the world, and forms the lynchpin for any theory of scientific evidence.  More recently, the broader social importance of measurement, and its complex role in policy and the institutionalization of implicit value judgments has been recognized, critiqued, and philosophically reconceived.  Especially important examples here include educational testing, diagnosis of mental disorders, and large scale, policy determining measures of well-being, poverty, quality of life, and other value-laden concepts.",
    "course_description": "This course will introduce key debates in the philosophical foundations of measurement.  General topics covered will include the difference between scale types, the problem of nomic measurement, and the realism debate.  In addition to these general issues, more specific topics will be addressed, which may vary from year to year.  Possible further topics include: the epistemic significance of the \"New SI,\" which defines measurement units by fixing the values of physical constants; the metaphysics of quantities; the \"quantity objection\" in psychology, namely the worry that psychological attributes aren't conceptualized as quantitative, so cannot legitimately be measured; and the question whether ethical considerations on the measurement of thick concepts, such as well-being or poverty, require that measurement instruments are \"co-created\" by the subjects of measurement in collaboration with scientists.While exact topics may vary year to year, the course will always draw on examples from both the physical and human sciences and address debates that are distinctive to both kinds of scientific inquiry.",

Normative ethics seeks general accounts of right / wrong and good / bad; practical ethics seeks to answer specific practical questions from an ethical point of view. By contrast, metaethics prescinds from these first-order questions to ask second-order questions about the 'status of morality'. Core issues in metaethics arise in each of the following areas as applied to morality: (a) metaphysics, (b) epistemology, (c) the philosophy of language, and (d) the philosophy of mind. In this course, we consider several traditional metaethical theories, including nonnaturalism, the error-theory, fictionalism, expressivism, and naturalism. We will also consider more contemporary theories that don't fit well into the more traditional categories. These include so-called 'hybrid theories,' constructivist theories, and pragmatist theories.",

    "course_description": "This course will introduce students to the 20th century philosophical movement of Phenomenology. Originating with the work of Edmund Husserl, Phenomenology attempts to ground substantive philosophical claims concerning metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, and beyond, in a careful articulation of the ways in which our experience of the world is structured. After introducing Phenomenology via some key ideas from Husserl's work, the course will focus on Merleau-Ponty's influential 1945 work, Phenomenology of Perception. There, Merleau-Ponty argues that proper attention to the structures that characterize thought and experience reveals that we are fundamentally embodied creatures, and that this has important consequences for our understanding of mind, language, metaphysics and epistemology. After spending the majority of the course (weeks 2-8) exploring ideas and arguments of key sections of Phenomenology of Perception in detail, the final weeks of the course will consider how Merleau-Ponty applied his views to aesthetics and ethics, and how other thinkers such as Heidegger and Sartre pursued Husserl's research programme in different ways.",

    "summary": "This course offers an introduction to philosophical methodology, with a particular focus on thought experiments, conceptual analysis and the role of rational intuitions. Conceptual analysis was once considered to be of primary concern to philosophers: to understand what a particular property is, such as being morally good, being conscious, being caused, or being known, one must produce necessary and sufficient conditions for something to fall under the concept of that property. Moreover, such conditions must be spelled out in a way that is independent of the concept in question. Many analyses have been confronted with counterexamples that rely on rational intuitions about how to describe possible cases. In response, some philosophers have given up on conceptual analysis altogether, some have adopted various weaker kinds of conceptual entailments, and some have argued that such intuitions are defeasible if the conceptual analysis in question leads to an otherwise explanatorily powerful philosophical theory about the property in question. These are some of the central issues in contemporary philosophical methodology, which we will be addressing in this course. We will examine the rational intuitions that particular thought experiments are meant to elicit, and we will assess the role of these intuitions in supporting or criticising a philosophical theory, or even in adjudicating between rival philosophical theories.",

    "summary": "Naturalism as a philosophical doctrine has no one precise definition. Minimally, naturalism suggests that philosophy should in some sense be guided by science, with different forms of naturalism offering a range of proposals as to what such guidance might entail. Naturalism is widely viewed as a positive term, and that a view counts as naturalist carries great weight across diverse philosophical debates.This course will expressly interrogate the notion of naturalism itself, as well as the role that naturalism plays in a number of different debates. We will consider such questions as: What is the distinction, and relation, between ontological and methodological naturalism? What is the relation between naturalism and physicalism? What arguments are offered for different forms of naturalism? How do different conceptions of naturalism impact on realism/anti-realism debates across different areas of philosophy? What alternatives to naturalism have been proposed? What implications does methodological naturalism have for philosophy itself?",
    "course_description": "The aim of the course will be to consider and critically assess both the concept and different forms of naturalism. Naturalism as a philosophical doctrine has no one precise definition. At the same time, naturalism is widely viewed as a positive term, and that a view counts as naturalist carries great weight across diverse philosophical debates. The term typically conveys some kind of connection with science. On the one hand there is the claim that we ought not to count as part of the content of reality things that are not somehow countenanced by science. There is no place in reality for spooky or supernatural entities. On the other, there is the claim that the scientific way of investigating reality is superior to all others. Both of these claims are philosophical claims and hence need to be subjected to philosophical scrutiny. Naturalism raises two broad groups of questions:(1) Questions about the relationship between philosophy and science: How might philosophy be guided by the sciences? Are science and philosophy methodologically continuous?(2) Questions about how to explain or accommodate entities and phenomena that are not obviously countenanced by science (e.g. some mental facts, normative and evaluative facts, mathematical facts, modal facts). Do they have to be reducible to natural (or physical) facts to count as natural and thus real?This course will engage both types of questions.Representative topics: ontological naturalism, methodological naturalism and the relation between them; physicalism, naturalism and the relation between them, reductive and non-reductive naturalism, different conceptions of naturalism (e.g. disciplinary, causal, Quinean); the relation between philosophy and science; naturalism in action in specific debates (e.g. ethics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of maths, modality)",

Discussion of animal communication and recent research on animal languages will be followed by discussion of moral considerability of animals and the question whether animals themselves can be held morally responsible for their actions and choices.

We will discuss whether friendship is indeed necessary for a good life or whether it is possible for a solitary life to be a good life as well. If it is part of a good life, what precisely is its value? In addition to its value, we will discuss the nature of friendship. One crucial feature of friendship is the fact that it unites some, but not all, people and thus brings about a distinction between friends and non-friends. The partiality of friendship in this sense leads to problems with regard to the impartiality of rationality and of morality: We will discuss epistemic and practical tensions between friendship and rationality. We will also consider how moral theories that require impartiality deal with the partiality of friendship and ask whether conflicts between friendship and morality can be resolved by deontologists and by consequentialists.",
    "course_description": "In this course, we will explore a number of key issues in the philosophy of friendship. Typical topics will include: the nature of friendship; the unity and partiality of friendship; the relation between friendship and reason; the relation between friendship and morality. We will ask what role friendship has in a good life and whether it is necessary for a good life or whether it is possible for a solitary life to be a good life as well.Typical topics1. The nature of friendshipAristotle famously distinguishes between three kinds of friendship: friendship based on virtue, on usefulness, and on pleasure. Modern accounts find the foundation of friendship in such things as trust (Thomas 2013) or plural agency and interpersonal emotion (Helm 2009). We will discuss a number of competing accounts of what friendship is.2. The unity of friendshipWhat unites friends? According to Aristotle, a friend is another self; Montaigne goes further by claiming that a perfect friendship is kind of fusion where friends become one in a much stronger sense: The friend is no longer another self. Plato (Lysis and Republic V) and Helm (2009) think that the unity consists in common action and emotion.3. Friendship and reasonSince friends are united and since we cannot be friends with everyone, friendship brings about a distinction between friends and non-friends. Some philosophers see a tension between friendship and reason. One of these debates concerns the epistemic partiality of friendship. In certain circumstances, we tend to evaluate the same evidence differently depending on whether it concerns a friend or a non-friend. Some scholars argue that this sort of epistemic partiality is irrational (Slote (2013)) while others consider it rationally justifiable (Brown (2013)).4. Friendship and moralityMoral theories tend to demand impartiality. This leads to problems of the following sorts: First, from a moral point of view, we ought to treat our friends no different from our non-friends, but often giving preference to friends seems to be the right thing to do. Second, there is, as Williams (1981) points out, a problem of motivation. If I visit a friend in the hospital (as I ought to), wouldn't it be wrong to motivated by obeying a moral law or maximising goodness instead of just doing it because I care? Wouldn't being morally motivated be 'one thought too many'? We will discuss answers that defenders of the major moral theories give to such challenges.5. Friendship and the good lifeWhat is it that makes friendship good? Is this good necessary for a good life? Is there a specific value to friendship or is friendship valuable because it provides us with other generic goods (e.g. pleasure, virtue, or knowledge)? We will look at different theories of the value of friendship (e.g. Stoics, Hurka (2013)). We will also discuss whether there is an aesthetic value to friendship.",

    "summary": "This course examines different conceptual analyses of information and their implications for issues in cognitive science, epistemology, and internet ethics.  The material divides roughly into two units.  In the first unit, we cover the use of information as a foundational concept for grounding theories of knowledge and mental representation.  In the second unit, we examine the way ethical considerations are transformed by informational interactions, addressing questions such as: Do interactions in virtual realms (chatrooms, MMORPGs, Second Life) carry the same ethical obligations as physical interactions? How does the algorithmic structure of social media accelerate the spread of fake news? and How does generative AI change our perspective on human creativity?",
    "course_description": "This course addresses philosophical questions around information of two different kinds.  The first half of the course considers information as a passive resource flowing through nature, and thereby potentially grounding theories of knowledge, inference, and mental representation.  Topics covered in this unit of the course typically include Shannon information, semantic information, the distinction between natural and non-natural meaning, and the factivity (or not) of information.The second unit considers the active role of information flow as it mediates human interactions on the internet, and how this active role interacts with cognitive biases to change our behavior, our interests, and our obligations.  Topics will change from year to year to reflect current events, technological innovations, and student interest.  Topics covered in recent years include: the role of social media in the spread of disinformation and fake news; political and ethical implications of the economic structure of the internet, including surveillance capitalism; information warfare; and the epistemology of Wikipedia.In the final paper, students will be encouraged to pursue their own interests in information, combining distinctions and insights about information introduced in the course with their own relevant background experience through a self-designed research topic.",

Is it in the head or can it extend beyond my skull and into the world?-\tWhat is innate knowledge, and do we have any?-\tWhat is the nature of introspection?These issues bring together traditional concerns from the philosophy of mind and findings from psychology and neuroscience, and we will draw on a variety of sources in exploring possible answers to these questions.",
    "course_description": "Students will learn about core topics in philosophy of mind and cognitive science, e.g. representational theories of mind, theories of consciousness, the relation between conscious and non-conscious processes, levels of analysis of the mind, and evolutionary considerations in cognitive science.",

This literature will serve the starting point for this course, but we will go on to consider a much broader range of sources Â¿ drawing upon psychology, risk management and legal theory.  Specific topics to be covered will vary from year to year but may include the ethics of risk imposition, risk-taking in extreme sport, the legal distinction between attacks and endangerments and whether there is such a thing as a Â¿de minimis riskÂ¿ Â¿ a risk that is so small that it can be rationally ignored.",

In some recent philosophical literature, however, the dominance of this probabilistic approach has been challenged, and certain non-probabilistic conceptions of risk have been proposed Â¿ such as the modal account, the normic account and the relevant alternatives account.  This literature has also explored the possibility of a pluralism about risk, on which there are several distinct but equally legitimate conceptions of risk.This course will begin with an exploration of this recent literature.  We will look at the viability of various different conceptions of risk, and investigate the prospects for a risk pluralism.  This material will then be used to offer a new perspective on a number of well known topics in philosophy and beyond.  The precise topics will vary from year to year but may include the ethics of risk imposition, the question of whether we have a right that others not impose risks upon us, the psychology of risk-taking, risk-taking in extreme sport, the legal significance of risk, including the distinction between attacks and endangerments, and the question of whether there is such a thing as a Â¿de minimis riskÂ¿ Â¿ a risk that is so small that it can be rationally ignored.This is an interdisciplinary course.  As well as drawing upon literature in philosophy, we will also be using sources from psychology, risk management and legal theory.",

How do we know that our world is not a virtual world? Would it even matter if it was? Can one lead a meaningful life in a virtual world? This course provides the opportunity to engage with some of the diverse and controversial answers to these questions. In doing so, we will make connections to, and be guided by, doctrines and positions from the history of philosophy.",
    "course_description": "The course will be divided into four main parts, each of which will be addressed, although the exact distribution of topics and the emphasis may vary in any given year.1. Knowledge and virtual worldsThis part of the course addresses the distinctive epistemological issues arising from virtual worlds. The following are representative topics which will usually be covered:a) How do we know we aren't in a simulation?b) Is it likely that we are in a simulation?2. Reality and virtual worldsThis part of the course addresses the distinctive metaphysical issues arising from virtual worlds. The following are representative topics which will usually be covered:a) What is reality?b) What is virtual reality?c) Can virtual things be real?3. Mind and virtual worldsThis part of the course addresses the distinctive issues in the philosophy of mind arising from virtual worlds. The following are representative topics which will usually be covered:a) How do mind and body interact in a virtual world?b) Can there be consciousness in a simulation?c) Does augmented reality extend the mind?4. Value and virtual worldsThis part of the course addresses the distinctive moral issues arising from virtual worlds. The following are representative topics which will usually be covered:a) Can one lead a good life in a virtual world?b) Do simulated lives matter?",

Through looking at its historical development, we can examine whether the victory of scientific realism is deserved, or if other historically significant views should be endorsed once again.",

We will begin by examining the forms of realism that emerged at the start of the century, and how they interacted with rival empiricist, phenomenological and neo-Kantian approaches. We will examine the mid-century decline of logical empiricism, and the canonical arguments in favour of realism. We will finish with an assessment of contemporary varieties of realism: structuralism (considering, in particular, its origins in neo-Kantian philosophy of science), perspectival realism, and recent attempts to align realism with a pragmatist approach to truth.Students will learn through independent reading of challenging historical texts, discussion of those texts in class, presentations delivered by the instructor, and student presentations.",

    "summary": "There is a distinctive experience that humans have when they think about situations that seem to involve moral considerations. While these experiences may be amenable to theoretical formalisation, there is important philosophical reflection to be done without theory. What do people understand when they understand a situation as demanding moral consideration, reflection or decision? This course aims to make progress with this and related questions and in the process complement our other, more formal, courses in moral philosophy.",
    "course_description": "The central question with which this course is concerned is: what is the nature of the understanding someone has when they engage with their moral concerns? These moral concerns are considered to arise in relatively ordinary situations of the kinds presented in life, literature and film. These situations include decisions about what to do; wondering how to live; questions of whether one is under a moral obligation; contemplation of shame or guilt.In this sense, this course is a philosophical examination of various phenomena - moral phenomena - about which philosophical theories are constructed. The main goals will be to focus on the nature of the understanding we have of these phenomena with a view to clarifying which are their essential features and which do not distinguish them. Central to this examination, the course will consider how other philosophers have tried to delimit the phenomena or characterise our moral understanding.",

If so, what does philosophical progress consist in? If philosophy doesnÂ¿t make progress, what does that imply about the value or significance of philosophical reflection?4.\tWhat, if anything, distinguishes philosophy from other disciplines?5.\tWhat is the relationship between questions about the nature of philosophy and philosophy itself?6.\tIs there a correct philosophical method? If so, what is it?Students will be invited to think about these questions in the context of the particular subfields of philosophy or philosophical debates they have studied or are particularly interested in. They will be expected to reflect on the significance of their answers to these and related questions for their own philosophical outlooks and interests.  Students will be asked to write and discuss with their peers several short reflective essays exploring the topics of the course and developing their own views. These short essays will serve as the basis for a longer summative essay.Readings for the course will be drawn from a variety of historical and contemporary sources. Readings may include texts from: Hume, Carnap, Wittgenstein, Cavell, Feyerabend, Van Fraassen, Rorty, Chalmers, Beebee, Williamson, and contemporary contributions to meta-metaphysics.",

Critical engagement with the works of Spinoza and Leibniz will allow us to assess the degrees to which they succeeded in this quest, examining how, for instance, the metaphysical monism of Spinoza leads to a necessitarianism that poses difficulties for individual ethical agency and freedom and how Leibniz sought through his metaphysical pluralism to overcome these problems.",

Gods and Religion.After the first three sessions, presented by the lecturer, students will be asked to research and present one topic each. Normally, this will then lead to their essay, although students are not obliged to write on the topic if they wish to pursue something else.

They will also start learning how to build experiments to collect data. During tutorials, students will learn to work as a group to understand the readings and dissect the writer's arguments. They will learn to discuss/debate respectfully and develop their public speaking skills to articulate their points. In the assessments, they have a strict word count to follow. They start developing clear written communication, how to convey their arguments succinctly, adapt their writing style to the audience, and how to bring clarity and structure to the essay.Core skills gained on this course:Critical thinking, critical analysis, considering alternative perspectives, formulating arguments, independence, taking initiative, learning from mistakes, taking on feedback and improving, problem solving, discussing/debating respectfully, clear written communication, having clarity and structure, adapting style to audience, resilience, workload management, programming/coding skills, data analysis, building experiments.",

In semester 1, lectures cover fundamental principles of describing data and of probability theory. In semester 2, lectures build up to discussion of how we make inferences about our hypotheses in psychology, dealing with probability distributions, sampling, and hypothesis testing. The course then introduces simple statistical tests for two variables by way of example. The course starts from scratch, assuming no knowledge of programming.In the practical lectures and labs, the course introduces the fundamental principles of R programming, with a focus on understanding in a general way how R works, such that these principles can be applied to the use of R for applied data analysis. Students will apply this learning to topics such as basic calculation, data management, plotting and use of simple statistical tests.Collectively the course will teach basic programming and data analysis skills, including the principles of applying quantitative analysis to answering research questions, and the fundamentals of writing up and reporting results in an accurate way.",

    "summary": "This course focuses on the psychological processes that underlie human learning, reasoning and decision-making. A major theme is the central role played by causal models in cognition: how people learn models from uncertain data, and use these models to draw inferences and make decisions.The course will explore the role of causal theories and reasoning in both adults' and children's cognition, as well as in underpinning the methodologies we use as cognitive psychologists to understand the human mind.",
    "course_description": "The search for a causal understanding of the world is at the heart of human cognition.  It shapes learning throughout development and guides intelligent behaviour by allowing cognisers to predict outcomes, selectively gather information, attribute blame and credit, and imagine hypothetical and counterfactual situations. Causal reasoning is also central to the scientific method, underpinning how we, as scientists, design experiments, build and evaluate theories including the ones we use to describe and understand our own minds.This course will make sense of the cognitive processes involved in learning and representing a causal model of the world. This will involve introducing formal frameworks from computational cognitive science including Bayesian probability theory and causal graphical models. Alongside this, the course will involve critiquing a number of behavioural experiments that have probed how adults and children learn through interacting with causal systems and how they use their causal knowledge to solve problems and gather rewards.This course takes a broader, more philosophical, perspective on cognition than many other psychology electives, so offers an opportunity to reflect on psychology as a whole and to connect its topics under a unified scientific perspective. Indeed, the course touches on all six of the British Psychological SocietyÂ¿s core topic areas.  Its primary basis is in cognitive and developmental psychology and statistics. However, it also has clear links to social psychology (through issues of responsibility attribution), differential psychology (though the statistical challenges of inferring the causes and consequences of personality) and biological psychology (through questions of how the structure of our representations reflect the structure of the brain and the environment). The course will provide lots of opportunity to build up critical thinking and academic writing skills.The course will cover a range of topics related to causality in thought, including (but not limited to):(a) A history of philosophical ideas about causality.(b) How causal models support learning, thinking and reasoning.(c) How learning in humans goes beyond model-free behaviourist and conditioning accounts.(d) The key difference between learning from observation (correlational data) vs. learning from intervention (experimental data).(e) The 'child as scientist' theory, and how causal learning shapes learning development across childhood.(f) The role of time in causal learning and reasoning.(g) How our causal beliefs and theories colour how we interpret new evidence.(h) How causal models and counterfactuals shape judgments of responsibility and blame.",

    "summary": "This course outlines Discursive Social Psychology and Critical Social Psychology. It examines how these approaches have changed our understanding of social psychological topics with reference to empirical studies of self and social identities; gender; prejudiced attitudes; inequality and power; thinking, subjectivity and emotion. It discusses key debates to which these different approaches have given rise.",
    "course_description": "This course draws on ideas and arguments from other disciplines (such as studies of science, social constructionism, Foucault, and 'the turn to language') to examine the basis and nature of social psychological knowledge, how it affects individuals' lives, the role of language, and assumptions about self that underpin psychological theory and research. We ask whether social constructionism and the analysis of discourse can provide an alternative approach for social psychologists. If so, what kind of discourse analysis? We explore how these different discursive approaches have been used empirically in studies of gender and other identities; attitudes and prejudice talk; power; subjectivity, memory, and emotion. This course includes lectures, in-class and online discussions, and debates about key issues.Regular class work and formative feedback will help students develop skills in critical analysis, presenting and structuring arguments, understanding, verbal communication, and group work/collaboration. The short coursework assessments and final essay will help to develop further skills in information integration and writing.",

    "course_description": "DAPR3 builds on the content of DAPR2 and covers more advanced methods that are invaluable for analysing many types of psychological study, preparing students for their dissertations.This course offers students a solid foundation in multilevel modeling, expanding the linear model to analyze 'hierarchical data.' Such data often involves observations clustered within higher-level groups, such as trials within participants, timepoints within individuals, or children within schools. In the second half of the course, we delve into data reduction techniques. These methods allow us to effectively summarize multiple correlated variables, either through weighted composites or by positing underlying latent factors. Additionally, students will gain insights into crucial concepts, including measurement error, validity, reliability, and replicability. These concepts are especially essential for researchers in psychology, where surveys or questionnaires are used to conduct studies of underlying constructs that cannot be directly measured.The semester-long course will be taught via a combination of lectures and practical labs. The latter is designed to help students put learning into practice and get hands-on experience with implementing the techniques they learn about in the lecture in R. Suggested readings will be provided for each topic. In addition, attendance at lecturer and/or teaching co-ordinator office hours and engagement with the online Discussion board for the course is encouraged.",

    "course_description": "This course will explore the production and comprehension of human speech from the perspectives of cognitive psychology and social communication.  A particular focus of the course is those aspects of speech which are not conveyed in writing, such as the ways in which we speak (intonation, loudness etc.) the noises we make which are not conventionally written down (*um*, *uh*, and other disfluencies), and the gestures and movements we make while speaking.The course has three parts.  In the first, we will explore how words and sentences are produced, what humans do beyond language to support that production (managing rhythm, holding the floor), and what happens when the production system runs into difficulties.  We will also investigate how aspects of speech which are not typically written down can be used to influence the meaning of what is said (for example, when attempting to deceive the listener).In the second part, we will focus on the comprehension of human speech, looking at how words and sentences are deciphered and focusing particularly on the non-written aspects:  Are listeners able to use signs of difficulty to help them understand speakers intentions?  Are they sensitive to cues about floor-holding and turn-taking?  Are they able to discern cues that the speaker doesn't literally mean what they are saying?In the final part of the course, we will explore how written language is changing  to become more speech-like, for example by including written disfluencies, and by adding emoji to convey emotions.The course will be delivered as a series of 10 1-hour lectures and 10 1-hour seminars.  The seminars will typically cover one or more relevant papers, and will include content on research design:  How can we design experiments to evaluate the ways in which human speech is produced and understood?",

Specifically, this course will explore the cognitive, relational, emotional, and behavioural effects shared social identities can have, and how social identities emerge and develop. A fundamental question is what makes collective behavior possible in a variety of situations, and how examples from recent empirical research on collective behavior can enhance our knowledge of existing identity theories. This course will critically review the scope and limitations of identity theories through different crowd contexts: mass gatherings, collective action, and responses to mass disasters. It will provide students with a strong understanding of key theories in identity research, and the ability to critically evaluate their strengths and weaknesses through recent high-impact empirical research drawing on a range of methodologies.",
    "course_description": "In this course, we will explore the reasons that people come together as crowd and the processes that underlay collective behaviour. We will cover fundamental theories used in identity research, particularly the social identity approach, and how they can be used to understand collective behaviour based on empirical evidence using a range of methodologies.We will focus on a variety of crowd contexts to examine phenomena such as the emotional and relational effects that being in a crowd can have (e.g. in festivals and mass gatherings), norm creation and empowerment (e.g. in protests and riots), and social support and resilience in disasters (e.g. flooding and emergency evacuations). Throughout the course, we will assess current myths of collective behaviour such as irrational panic behaviour and mindless violence. Crucially, we will use research on collective behaviour as an analytic lens to measure the strengths and weaknesses of current identity theories.The course will consist of lectures, seminars, and large and small group discussions and debates to fully engage with the course content. The assessments will focus on knowledge and understanding, writing skills, with a particular emphasis on critical evaluation and independent learning. Through this course, students will develop their critical evaluation skills, knowledge and understanding of core theories in social psychology, ability to analyse contrasting theories and empirical evidence, and communication skills in both verbal discussions and written assessments.",

We will cover research in analogical reasoning as well as the development of analogical thinking and the representations that support analogy and generalisation.The second half of the course will focus on computational theories of how humans and artificial (i.e., machine) systems perform induction and generalisation. We will cover broadly the main approaches to representing knowledge and modelling human cognition (symbolic and connectionist models). We will then cover how these approaches have been leveraged to explain human induction and learning with focus on traditional production system models, Bayesian models, neural network models, and symbolic-connectionist models.Students will engage with lectures and readings every week and will be asked to actively engage with and discuss the topics covered. Students will complete a midterm consisting of MCQs and a short essay (500 words), a set of unassessed formative formal exercises including responses to readings and applications of simplified versions of existing computational models, and a final essay (2000 words).",

The course material will draw heavily on structural and functional neuroimaging as well as studies of individuals with language deficits. It will also emphasise how understanding the neural basis of language sheds light on the cognitive mechanisms of language processing and how it can inform treatment of language impairments.The course material will be delivered through lectures and assigned readings, as well as class discussion to foster critical thinking and evaluation of the methods and theoretical claims.

We will cover theoretical approaches to perception and action, the use of vision and body-senses to guide action, body representation as a feat of multisensory integration, and the experience of body ownership and agency. We will finish by connecting some of the main course themes with the contemporary theoretical framework of predictive processing. Evidence will be drawn from diverse techniques in cognitive neuroscience, but with a focus on the study of neuropsychological symptoms following brain damage. Students will gain practice in interpreting primary literature, and evaluating it with respect to larger theoretical frameworks, and the assessment will focus on core skills of evidence-based academic writing.",
    "course_description": "The course begins by giving an overview of major theoretical perspectives on perception, from constructivist and ecological approaches, to notions of enactive perception and embodied cognition. It will be argued that constructivist and ecological approaches have to some extent been combined in a dual streams model of human vision, which emphasises that visual information is processed in different brain areas, in different ways, for different purposes. We will then consider how we represent our bodies and the external world in relation to one another, in order to make purposeful action possible. We will refine our discussion of a body representation for action, considering how this relates to our feeling of ownership of our bodies, and the concept of body image. We will then focus on some key requirements for effective action guidance, highlighting the importance of feedback-based control, and forward modelling. We will consider whether these control principles might help explain how it is that we feel that like active agents in the world, rather than passive spectators on our actions. Finally, we will see how the concept of forward modelling is now being applied within contemporary predictive processing approaches to perception, action and cognition.",

A primary focus will be on trait theories of personality differences, but variability within individuals over time and across situations, assessment, development, genetic and environmental interplay, involvement in life outcomes, and cross-cultural patterns will also be addressed. The first three weeks will be lectures introducing major theories, topics to be debated by the students, and the debating project. After that, sessions will alternate between student debates on specified topics to build critical thinking, verbal expression, and argumentation skills and lecture, beginning with a debate. Students will be randomly allocated to eight groups that will be randomly paired in assigned debating class periods. During the last third of each of these four sessions, each student will write a 150-word summary defending one of the positions taken by the week's debaters to consolidate the learned material. Each summary will be independently peer-marked by two other students at the end of the session, to consolidate the material further. The peer marks will not be recorded for the course but will be returned to students as feedback.",

Students will review an area of the psychology literature relevant to the research interests of the staff member who supervises the project, and design and conduct a psychological study in that area. The project will be written up in two pieces of work, a literature review and a research report in the form of a journal article. In addition, students will take part in a group presentation of their research work, prior to submitting the final research report.The small-group nature of the course will provide an opportunity for students to engage in discussion with a staff member for 4 hours in semester one (3hrs - literature review, 1hr -planning project) and 4 hours in semester two (research design, analysis and interpretation). In addition, students will attend 4 hours of lectures each semester that highlight key aspects of research work that all psychologists should know. Students will be required to spend approximately three further hours per week to research the literature, design the study, and successfully complete data collection, analysis and write-up of the work.",
    "course_description": "This is a course in which the majority of staff-student interaction will be in small groups (around 6-10 students), with a supervisor. Supervisors will offer projects in a range of areas of psychological research, which could at any given time include qualitative or experimental studies, surveys, or meta-analyses.In the first semester, students will write a literature review on the topic of the research to be done in the second semester. For mid-semester feedback, they will submit a plan for this review, and then submit the final review toward the end of Semester 1.In the second part of the course, the students will, with the guidance of the supervisor, develop their research design as a group, and then conduct the research. As a group, the students will complete a Progress Report in the middle of Semester 2, similar to the Progress Report that they will need to complete for their Dissertation in Year 4. As a group, they will also present their work toward the end of the semester. Both the Progress Report and Group Presentation are important opportunities for feedback. The final assessment will consist of a complete report in journal article format (including discussion).",

In the second assessment, students will learn how to independently find jobs and analyse them using psychological frameworks. Students will learn how to analyse the requirements of the role using a psychological model, and use this information to self-reflect on their own strengths and areas for improvement. They will present their findings in a short, pre-recorded presentation that closely reflects current trends in interview formats. Students will develop their analytic, presentation and public speaking skills and will hopefully develop a concrete idea of what they would like to do after their degrees. In both assessments students will learn how to communicate with limited word counts or time, a key skill in the workplace, and adapt their communication style to one appropriate for a non-psychological audience. Both assessments may be different to any that students have done before and they will learn how to adjust their expectations and adapt to a new way of working.Core skills gained on this course:Independence, research skills, taking initiative, critical analysis, problem solving, self-reflection (identify strengths and areas for improvement), clear written communication, presentation skills, public speaking, writing, and presenting within word counts or time limits, resilience.",

    "course_description": "This course aims to cover the main current research areas in the psychology of language comprehension, aiming for breadth, but going into depth in some selected topics. We will start by discussing the neural foundations of language processing, drawing on evidence from aphasia and from brain imaging. We then go on to consider language processing at successively higher levels, starting with the perception of single words, and going on to discuss the comprehension of whole sentences, and then multi-sentence texts, paying attention to how the language comprehension system is supported by related cognitive processes, such as prediction, and memory encoding, storage and retrieval. Having established these foundations, we then discuss the role of language in social cognition, taking gender stereotype inferences as a test case.The course encourages students to develop skills of critical analysis, and how to structure arguments to evaluate theories, leading to an understanding the nature of evidence for those theories.  The course also allows students to understand how psychological research can be applied to real-world problems.",

Next, we will consider construct definition and item writing, including test instructions and selection of response formats. We will discuss the evaluation and refinement of these item pools through content validation with subject matter experts and users and pilot studies. Follow this, we will introduce quantitative methods for scale evaluation including factor analytic and item response theories. We will contrast these tools and detail the different types of information they provide about the quality of a test. Next, we will consider the topics of reliability, validity and test bias. Finally, we will spend some time discussing the common practice of scoring and norming (normative samples, z-scores, stanines), a process designed to help the interpretation of test outcomes.The course will be delivered via a mix of lecture, class discussion and group exercises. During the exercises, we will work with a number of established psychometric tools from across psychology, and critically evaluate the evidence present in the test manuals.",

    "course_description": "The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to clinical neuropsychology. The student will be introduced to methods of clinical neuropsychological assessment (including standardised clinical neuropsychology tests) and rehabilitation techniques. A key principle is critical evaluation of the literature to train the student to undertake evidence based clinical practice. There is a particular focus on the assessment and rehabilitation of memory and executive functions in a range of neuropsychological disorders including acquired brain injury and the dementias. Lectures often focus around a video of a case assessment. The course also includes input from different clinical neuropsychology specialities working within the NHS, including adult and paediatric clinical neuropsychology.",

The content of blocks will be tailored to the specialisation of the teaching team member, possibly covering research fields such as visual perception, memory, executive function, attention and action, language processing, and cortical development.Within each block students will learn about the type of research ongoing within that research field and how that research informs our understanding of the human mind and brain. This could include learning about recent advancements in methodology or theory, current controversies or new ground-breaking discoveries. Students also learn what challenges cognitive neuroscience research faces and what the key questions are for the future.Traditional content-based lectures will be complemented by student-led discussion sessions. These sessions could include activities such as, critically evaluating an empirical paper, designing a research experiment or debating a contentious issue in a particular research field.",

Throughout, the course will examine both typical adult language processing as well as neurogenic language disorders. The course material will be conveyed through lectures, assigned readings, and discussion of current debates.",
    "course_description": "This course will provide a contemporary, focused survey of the neural basis of human language processing. The course will guide students through the methods, the key findings, and their implications for understanding the mechanisms of language processing and language impairments. It will begin with an overview of fundamental aspects of brain structure and function, then cover core areas of language processing, such as word meaning, speech perception and articulation, comprehension and production of complex expressions including grammatical structure and narrative speech, dialogue, processing language in written and signed modalities, and bilingualism. The course material will draw on structural and functional neuroimaging as well as studies of individuals with language deficits. It will also emphasise how understanding the neural basis of language sheds light on the cognitive mechanisms of language processing and how it can inform treatment of language impairments. The course material will be delivered through lectures and assigned readings, as well as class discussion to foster critical thinking and evaluation of the methods and theoretical claims. Critical thinking, independent research, and written communication will be further cultivated in the studentsÂ¿ written assignments.",

Typically, the topic and supervisor selection are completed by January; planning is completed by the end of April and the whole project is completed by late July. Typically, the project involves setting up a rationale and hypotheses / specific research questions for an empirical project; collecting and analysing data, or re-analysing existing data, to address the hypotheses / questions; and writing the rationale, methods and results up, alongside a discussion and similarly to a journal article. The dissertation is up to 6,000 words long. Students can work in pairs to prepare for the project and collect data, but the dissertations are written and marked individually.",

    "summary": "This course has the format of student presentations on a curated set of core topics of the field supplemented with lectures from the course coordinator and occasional guests.The course immerses students in the intelligence literature - how intelligence affects our lives, the size and development of differences in intelligence, IQ testing, behaviour and molecular genetics, environments such as school, the structure of intelligence. A number of methods come up along the way and are described. The primary reading for the course is based on influential articles, both recent and past.",
    "course_description": "The course will begin with introductory lectures  providing an overview of intelligence. In this early period we will also develop the week-to-week plan for the course, which depends entirely on what students will present each week.Below is a list of areas from which students can select their presentation topic. Other topics are possible by agreement with the course organizer. Each presentation will be based on papers, usually comparing at least two papers. Before their presentation, students must discuss their plans individually with the course organizer, including an interactive session pre-viewing the presentation with the lecturer. Students must also write a summary of their presentation and submit this along with their presentation (it will be sent to all students of the course).Each presentation is followed by group discussion - probably in forums, but live online if possible. Participation in discussions is part of assessment.-\tThe course organizer will review your topic, then once you have made it, your power point and speaking notes (or a draft recording). This will usually be done interactively over a video call like Teams (or in person if possible).-\tYou will pre-record your presentation, which should last 15 minutes or longer.-\tEach student will post at least one question after the recording goes up - usually in a class forum, and the presenter will provide short answers to each-\tThe course organizer will write or record a discussion for the talk.Topics covered are:1) The definitions and structure of intelligence2) The nature of general intelligence (underlying cognitive and biological structure)3) Genetic and familial influences on intelligence (e.g., twin/family and molecular genetic studies)4) Intelligence and lower-level cognitive processes5) The biological foundations of intelligence6) The evolutionary psychology of intelligence and intelligence in in nonhuman animals7) The influences of intelligence on health, well-being, and psychopathology8) Intelligence, culture, national and cohort differences9) Intelligence, development and ageing10) Intelligence and personality: empirical relations and conceptual similarities and differences11) Intelligence and society12) Intelligence in organizational settings13) Modifiability of intelligence",

    "course_description": "Univariate Statistics and Methodology in R (USMR) is a semester long crash-course aimed at providing Masters students in psychology with a competence in standard statistical methodologies and data analysis using R. Typically the analyses taught in this course are relevant for when there is just one source of variation - i.e., when we are interested in a single outcome measured across a set of independent observations. The first half of the course covers the fundamentals of statistical inference using a simulation-based approach, and introduces students to working with R & RStudio. The latter half of the course focuses on the general linear model, emphasising the fact that many statistical methods are simply special cases of this approach. This course introduces students to statistical modelling and empowers them with tools to analyse richer data and answer a broader set of research questions.Typical Syllabus:* Introduction to the use of statistical methods in research.* Introduction to R for statistics* Refresher in inferential statistics including Hypothesis testing, Type I vs. Type II errors, p-values, power, correlation, chi-squares.* Linear regression: including diagnostics, transformation, different families of models.* Multiple regression: extending linear regression to multiple IVs and including interactions, effects coding.* The generalized linear model (GLM).",
