By meeting the learning outcomes, students will have acquired skills useful across a wide range of chemical disciplines, and applicable throughout their degree.The course is delivered through ten workshops (30 hours total). Each three-hour workshop will involve a blended mixture of background information and hands-on programming tasks, focussed around a specific chemical topic. Such topics will include classification of data from the periodic table, visualisation and numerical analysis of experimental data, and manipulation and geometrical analysis of chemical structures. Students will be expected to complete additional problems outside of the timetabled workshops, extending their knowledge of the methods and providing formative feedback. Assignments related to the workshop content will assess the student's achievement in relation to the learning outcomes, while a final mini project will draw together the different course topics in a single, assessed problem-solving exercise.",

    "summary": "A course of lectures on how medicines are designed and developed, with emphasis on the key properties required for developing a successful medicine. This course will discuss how physicochemical properties affect drug design and activity, the use of computational and structure-based drug design, common reactions that are widely used in medicinal chemistry, the different types of drug targets that are currently Â¿druggableÂ¿, emerging new drug classes that can expand the types of disease targets we can modulate, consideration of the pharmacokinetic properties of a drug and how a drug can be translated from the lab to clinic.",
    "course_description": "The course comprises six individual five-lecture courses that describe common and emerging approaches in drug discovery and design. The course will afford an appreciation of the importance of mode of action, structure-activity relationships, pharmacokinetics and physicochemical properties in successful drug design; as well as the methods that are key to their optimisation.Physicochemical Properties in Drug Design - the role of physical organic chemistry in understanding the relationships between the physicochemical and biological properties of pharmaceutical agents. A discussion of the role of structure-activity relationships in modern-day drug design and development.Computational Drug Design - the driving forces of protein-ligand association and current strategies to optimise the potency or selectivity of a small molecule ligand. An introduction to the main computational methods currently used to support rational approaches to drug design in academia and industry.Synthetic Methods in Medicinal Chemistry - the common synthetic organic methods that are widely used in the synthesis of drug-like compounds e.g. Suzuki coupling, amide bond formation, fluorination, C-H activation. An explanation of the key features of these reactions, including reagents, curly arrow mechanisms and selectivities.Therapeutic Targets and Classes - how different types of drug molecule can modulate specific classes of biological molecule such as nucleic acids, transcription factors, enzymes, membranes and cell-surface receptors. A discussion of these target classes illustrated with specific examples from MHRA and FDA approved drugs and drugs in clinical trials.Emerging Modalities in Medicinal Chemistry - alternative approaches to drug design including Â¿non-traditionalÂ¿ small molecules such as PROTACs and peptides, biologics including antibody-drug conjugates, and theranostic agents. An overview of some of the most promising emerging modalities in medicine under investigation by the pharmaceutical industry.Translational Aspects of Drug Design and Development - target identification, key drug target classes and their mechanisms of action, understanding of pharmacokinetic (ADME) properties of drug molecules and how these may differ between drug classes and biological targets; as well as the safety/toxicity profiles of candidate molecules. Translation of drugs from the lab to clinic.",

    "summary": "This is a course of lectures, tutorials and workshops that focuses on the interaction between key biological macromolecules and a wide range of fundamental physical phenomena. The course will describe the means by which these potentially highly informative interactions can be studied, and the data collected and processed. The subsequent exploitation of this data to infer key information concerning the three-dimensional structures, composition, dynamics, spatiotemporal distributions and mutual interactions of biological polymers such as proteins and nucleic acids will be outlined. The benefits to be gained from combined use of orthogonal but complementary techniques in an integrated fashion will be emphasized. The course will also teach how knowledge of the physical properties of biological polymers can be used to predict the way in which they fold, adopt quasi-stable tertiary structures and form complexes with other molecules.This course (as specified in the degree programme tables) is a compulsory requirement for Year 4 students on MChem degree in Medicinal and Biological Chemistry, but can be taken by Year 4 students on any MChem Chemistry degree programme.",

    "summary": "NMR spectroscopy is one of the fundamental analytical techniques of a modern analytical laboratory with widespread applicability. It is an invaluable tool for the identification of structures of organic or inorganic molecules. NMR is a non-destructive, non-invasive and quantitative technique, covering many nuclei.  NMR spectroscopy has developed well beyond using simple one-dimensional experiments. Multidimensional experiments have dramatically increased the information content of NMR spectra enabling its application to studies of complex molecules, including biomolecules and complex mixtures. The technique excels at following conformational changes, intermolecular interactions, reaction kinetics and physical properties of molecules. The breadth of NMR experiments available led to its dissemination into many disciplines relevant to industry, such as drug discovery, medical diagnostics, food and drink, or environmental monitoring. While most applications discussed in this course involve solution state NMR, solid state NMR will be introduced focusing on application in the drug discovery process.This course will provide the required theory, practical experience in acquisition and interpretation of spectra across a wide range of scientific disciplines.",
    "course_description": "The course will consist of a mixture of theory-based lectures, tutorials, instrument/software skill sessions and practicals. The lectures and tutorials will cover the following topics:- Fundamentals of NMR spectroscopy, FT NMR, relaxation times, chemical shifts and coupling constants, number of signals, chemical and magnetic equivalence.- Interpretation of 1D NMR data- 2D NMR, homonculear and heteronuclear experiments- Interpretation of 2D NMR data- Chemical exchange, DOSY, selective excitation- Solid state NMR- Biomolecular NMR Â¿ biomolecular interactions and NMR structure determination of biomolecules- Paramagnetic NMR, nuclei other than 1H, metabolomics, mixtures, chemometrics",

    "summary": "Environmental chemistry is the study of the chemical composition and processes in the natural environment. It examines the behaviour of chemical species (whether natural or anthropogenic) in the hydrosphere, pedosphere, atmosphere and biosphere; exploring where these chemicals come from, what they interact with, and their mobility and transport within and between different environmental spheres.  An understanding of how the natural environment works on a molecular level allows us to understand the influence of human activities and what can be done to preserve ecosystems and the services they provide. At the heart of topic is analytical chemistry. For example, if asked what will happen if an industrial process puts a chemical into a lake, the environmental chemist needs to understand how to sample the lake, what techniques to use to identify and quantify that chemical, what the fate of the chemical may be and how to put the information in context of the natural processes going on in the lake. This course aims to provide the foundations to sample, analyse and interpret data from our natural environment. The skills and experience gained on this course will enhance career prospects in environmental consultancy, monitoring and various industries.",
    "course_description": "The course will build on the fundamental theory and practical skills of Analytical Chemistry semester 1 core modules. It will consist of a series of modules on the following topics: environmental sampling and experimental design; biogeochemical cycles and the interactions; fate and mobility of contaminants; atmospheric processes and analysis; soil and sediment profiling and analysis; natural water chemistry and drinking water quality. Course consists of lectures, tutorials and investigative/field work. The course topics are:- Chemistry of the Earth: Earths spheres, interactions, fluxes, burdens and biogeochemical cycles- Environmental sampling: sampling design, sample storage, risk management- Chemistry of Earths atmosphere: basic introduction to the composition and key chemistry of the atmosphere, with focus on tropospheric photochemistry and pollution- Atmospheric analysis: Sampling and quantification of gases and particles- Chemistry of Earths hydrosphere: water chemistry, water categories- Acidification of our natural environment: acid rain and deposition, consequences, monitoring- Drinking water quality and treatment- Speciation and metal analysis of soils and waters- Chemistry of Earths pedosphere: soil properties, types, reactions, organic matter- Soil profiling and monitoring: soil sampling methods, monitoring protocols, physical characterisation, decomposition, organic matter characterisation- Monitoring our environment (SEPA)",

The topic of the literature survey is defined in preliminary meetings with an assigned supervisor. Preliminary results are presented as a summary to outline the proposed structure and content of the review. The review then develops through a first and final draft stage before final submission. The supervisor will give feedback and guidance at several stages during the searching and review-writing process.
