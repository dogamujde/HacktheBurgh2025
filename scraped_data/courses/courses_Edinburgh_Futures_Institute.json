You will do this by sharing and collaborating with peers to increase your insights as an interdisciplinary practitioner, while building confidence in taking ownership for your learning and interdisciplinary practice.Topics will include frameworks and models for reflection, personal and collective goalsetting, wellbeing, and different ways in which knowledge and knowledge creation are approached across academic fields.",
    "course_description": "Interdisciplinary learning is key to the MA (Hons) in Interdisciplinary Futures, with this course helping you link the discrete programme components to make sense of it as a whole. The course's primary function is to provide you with the theories, tools and methods to integrate and consolidate your learning and development from across the programme, linking it to your own goals for your studies and beyond. The course combines the exploration of Knowledge Creation in different disciplines and subject areas with learning about and reflection on areas of Personal Growth. This will lead to a deep critical understanding of how different personal and discipline-based perceptions, biases, and ways of looking at the world shape our thinking and behaviour, and will support you in skilfully harnessing this understanding to successfully engage with global challenges.The focus of Reflections on Interdisciplinary Practice: Foundations is on transitions into university. You will learn about the foundations of study at university level, and how this may differ from prior study. This will include the fundamentals of critical thinking, sourcing data and effectively working with evidence to construct an argument. You will learn how to effectively use the library and other sources of information (e.g. databases, online sources) and how to evaluate these critically - by exploring how knowledge is constructed, and how this is reflected in the organisation of libraries, databases and other sources of information (Knowledge Creation). You will be introduced to different methods and frameworks for reflection, and frameworks for goal setting and evaluating progress against these goals. You will learn about team working and collaboration, including team dynamics and how diverse groups function, while gaining insights into successful teams-learning which can subsequently be applied to group projects elsewhere in the programme (Personal Growth).Student Learning Experience:Through this course you will learn and apply strategies for both academic and personal growth. This will include space for peer support activities (within and across cohorts), and support through key transition periods - i.e. into university and preparation for the transition into 2nd year. All components will be introduced in a combination of theory (foundations and principles) and practice (activities to engage in/with and apply the theory). These components will be delivered through a mix of activities that might include presentations, podcasts, video content and workshops, alongside practical exercises and activities with peers. There will also be time and space for writing and individual reflections.You will apply the knowledge and skills gained in this course to other parts of the degree programme, through a cycle of learning where you are introduced to theoretical foundations of a topic, observe, and then reflect on other programme components through this lens. Reflections and insights will be shared with peers on the course, leading to a deeper understanding of the theories and frameworks (and potential limitations). You will be aided in your progress by staff who you will meet individually or in groups at key stages throughout the year (beginning, middle and end) to discuss your personal goals, and to help assess your progress.",

    "summary": "How can we make sense of a complex and changing world? This course introduces a range of research methods in response to a diverse selection of 'global challenges'. Working together with students from a range of backgrounds, you will develop new skills in interdisciplinary research to help build better futures.",
    "course_description": "This course provides you with a methodological 'toolbox' to support the interdisciplinary practice that is required to explore and respond to global challenges. The key challenges facing the world today are complex, dynamic and multifaceted. They therefore require multiple perspectives, analyses and approaches. The course establishes foundational skills in a range of research methods for understanding and working with various types of text, data and media. For example, these might include Data Collection, Data Analysis, Creative Practice and Cultural Analysis. You will work in groups on focussed, structured activities to develop skills in these areas. A key feature of the course is the opportunity to continually return to these categories, ensuring an iterative learning experience that will continue beyond the course, through the programme, and informing a lifelong learning journey. Global challenges can only be addressed by working together, finding shared approaches, and adapting to new situations. This course is an essential introduction to conducting research in this way.The course is delivered through an innovative model using several concurrent 'workstations', located within the teaching space for weekly scheduled workshop activity. The academic year is divided into 'blocks', each of which presents a specific themed research question/enquiry. This might involve a complex problem which impacts on society, the economy or the environment (for example, transitions to net-zero carbon, building a circular economy, or decolonising the city). In preparation for the workshops, you will engage with an online resource introducing each of the methods categories, including essential reading, and set tasks or questions. This is a 'flipped' approach that ensures a level of understanding and engagement before the active, task-based learning of the workshops. You will then complete all the blocks by visiting each of the workstations in turn. This will involve group activities applying key methods to the specific enquiry, promoted by task-sheets and facilitated by a tutor. In practice, this means that there will always be several workshops taking place at the same time. Importantly, the content and approach emphasise the need to work together to explore challenges, and teamwork will be required throughout the course.",

It offers students a unique opportunity to engage with the contemporary city as a site for new ideas, designs and methods. The course responds creatively to Edinburgh's various sites and routes, bringing together students from across the university to work in interdisciplinary teams.",
    "course_description": "Creating Edinburgh takes an innovative approach to interdisciplinary education by shifting the site of learning from the seminar room to the city outside. It brings together groups of students from diverse subject areas to explore the contemporary city.This place-based approach provides a clear focus for group work, leading to new ways of conceptualising, practicing and sharing knowledge, as well as developing new skills in collaboration across disciplines. Students will be encouraged to see themselves as part of a connected global city and to engage with the complex challenges of urban life in the twenty-first century. Working in response to a complex environment and connecting with a wide range of perspectives is an opportunity to apply new understandings to specific challenges.The course offers distinct frameworks for exploring the city of Edinburgh. These may include, for example: Business Edinburgh, Decolonising Edinburgh, Sustainable Edinburgh, Deep Time Edinburgh, Pandemic Edinburgh, Wild Edinburgh, Performing Edinburgh, etc. A distinctive feature of the course is that students are able to curate their own content, programming the order of field trips from a selection of topics. This will be interspersed with an introduction week and three assessment workshops.Initially, the course introduces principles of interdisciplinary project work and explores methods and strategies for engaging with the city. Spaced across the course, the seven topic weeks will then offer a series of prompts and suggested tactics for engaging with Edinburgh's sites and routes.Students will work in ALGs (Autonomous Learning Groups) to research these topics prior to a weekly seminar, which will usually take place on campus. Weekly documentation will then be posted on an online repository, leading to an individual reflective document, which is the first point of summative assessment. Interspersing the topic weeks will be formative assessment presentations and workshops.For the formative assessment, students will work in ALG groups (3-4 students) to present a framework for a new topic (other than those already on offer). The task will be presented as an opportunity to research and develop a new perspective on the city, either from another discipline or through an interdisciplinary topic.Following presentations, the full tutorial group will agree on one or two topics to be developed for the final group assessment. The tutorial group then allocated tasks and worked on this topic over the following weeks, sharing progress on an online forum. This will be a 'background task' that feeds into the dedicated project work towards the final assessment point. This takes the form of a full (or half) tutorial group project, submitted as a digital resource at the end of the course. Importantly, the resource should be available for future cohorts to select and engage with as one of their topics. Selected topics will be developed in line with the pre-designed format to increase the range on offer.",

    "summary": "This course is about reimagining the future and seeing ourselves as part of this future.  Each year, this course will examine a single, highly current global event or challenge. It will explore the broader social, economic and environmental issues which have driven the challenge and how the impact of the event or challenge is shaping the future. From COVID-19 in 2020, it moved in subsequent years to the currents of climate crisis, conflict and the cost of living crisis, allowing students to explore and identify sustainable solutions to complex global challenges.Alongside stimulating lectures given by leading academics and other professionals from industry, government and third sector, it will include threads on the role of data in understanding and responding to complex challenges.  At the heart of this course is seeing how a globally significant event or challenge changes who we are, what we are, how we live, and what we believe.  We will look at how different types of data, and the ways in which data is represented from different disciplinary perspectives to offer critical new insights into how we respond collectively. We will focus on the challenges and opportunities posed by the revolution in data, digital and artificial intelligence, and the role of data for social good.The course will be contextualised by the UN Sustainable Development Goals Agenda (2015-2030), and its vision of a world shaped by the common good, where no one is left behind and in which the needs of humanity are balanced with the preservation of the Earth.",
    "course_description": "Academic description:'Currents' will examine the current happenings and events that profoundly shape our lives for better or worse, exploring through different data sets and data approaches the ways in which the world is being reframed and reimagined. Students will learn how different academic disciplines approach complex challenges and wicked problems, and how different theories, data and methods from these disciplines are used to understand the current, while mapping a path for the future. The course will reflect on the causes and drivers of these challenges - the sparks that lead to global fires that change world outlooks and shake world orders.The course not only explores the journey of multiple sets of knowledge and actions as they come together to respond to a global event or challenge, it is a journey of rethinking what this means on an individual, community, societal level for the future.By examining different data sources through interdisciplinary approaches and multiple lenses, the course will provide opportunities to understand the events of the immediate moment, and the currents that drive the systems in which we live. Students will learn about the different types of insights that different types of data provide, helping to develop the skills and knowledge needed (e.g. creative capacities, data and inquiry skills and critical thinking) to successfully navigate a rapidly evolving and technologised world.The course will take a transnational perspective, exploring why, how and what drives an event from the local to the global. It will seek to understand the intended and unintended consequences of global and local interactions and examine the associated risks, drivers and impacts.Outline content or syllabus:Each instance of the course will explore different content from various disciplines - linking the arts, humanities and social sciences together with medicine, natural sciences, engineering and data science.Student learning experience:Through this course students will encounter live issues impacting the world.  They will have the opportunity to listen to weekly key addresses from global and national leaders, offering students insights from many different disciplines, professions and traditions.  In addition to these keynote lectures, students will listen to a weekly discursive lecture from two or more colleagues at the forefront of their field from disciplines across the University.A series of short podcasts on methods of using and analysing data will accompany the lectures, to enable students to better understand different data types and disciplinary methodologies, the different types of insights that different types of data provide, and how these differences underpin decision making processes.Each week students will meet in online tutorial groups to discuss the topics and questions raised in the lectures and podcasts. Discussions will look at the multiplicity of information, and the exciting ways that information can be channelled and used to bring about change. Students will be encouraged to see how their own disciplines contributes to the way the future can be reimagined and how a major global event or challenge is a moment of change. Tutorial groups will have around 10 students, and they will prepare for these in autonomous learning groups by sharing readings and other resources.The assessment will take the form of a created object, an 'asset', in a medium of the student's choice through which they reflect on their experience of the theme covered, in the context of the global response to the theme explored during the course. This asset may be written, coded, painted, recorded, made or built. Students will have the opportunity to discuss their asset ideas with peers and teaching staff during a dedicated feedback session. Where appropriate these assets will be published and made available to the wider University and Edinburgh community. The asset can be viewed as an initial marker of the student's university journey, a gift to the wider community but also something that can be reflected back on during their time at Edinburgh. Alongside the asset students will write a short series of blogs (up to 2,000 words in total) reflecting on key issues or topics covered, and detailing the development and delivery of the asset. Blogs will be submitted at various points throughout the course, allowing for feedback to help inform the ideas behind the asset.By the end of the course, students will have developed a critical understanding of a current world event and will have built knowledge and skills to help them better understand the complexities of their relationship to it.Currents: An Exhibition https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/EFIstudentexhibitions/",

You will gain deep insight into a complex problem linked to one of our global challenge themes through work on a 'real world' issue faced by one of our external partners (the exact challenge statement will be confirmed shortly before the semester starts). Put your research, teamworking and problem-solving skills to use and make your learning benefit local communities!",
    "course_description": "In EFI Change Agents, you will practice and deepen your skills in research, team working and problem solving developed in your first year of study, whilst exploring a new topic and gaining deep knowledge and insight into a different complex set of problems.You will work in a small team of students to explore a challenge that has been proposed by an external partner and produce a set of outputs and recommendations that will help the external develop a solution for the problem. The problem statement that you and your team will be working on is linked to one of our overarching global challenge themes (e.g., sustainability, global health, inequality, conflict), and you will have access to a range of resources, which may include reading material, lectures (live or recorded), panel discussions and workshops, allowing you to develop a deeper understanding of this year's challenge theme. This will provide a useful broader context for the problem statement negotiated with the external partner, helping you to make the link between wider global issues and their manifestations at local level.The overarching theme and exact challenge statement will change year on year; examples from similar projects in previous years include topics such as 'How can the mental health of children living in Scotland be improved?', 'How can more sustainable tourism be encouraged in Edinburgh?', or 'How might we reduce food waste in cafeterias?'Throughout the course, you will use and further build on the skills in creative problem solving that you have developed in first year, and you will apply your knowledge and understanding of different methods of academic enquiry and analysis developed through 'Researching Global Challenges 1 and 2'; this includes researching and analysing different types of data (including numerical and digital data) and considering the ethical dimensions of working with data. A main focus of EFI Change Agents will be the further development of effective team working skills, including work on addressing the problems that arise when collaborating in diverse groups.The semester will start with a general introduction to the course and the challenge area, and you will get to know your team and work on a team charter to help you set your goals and build the foundations for successful collaboration. Early on, the external partner will be present to provide some context to the challenge from their point of view, and you will have opportunity to negotiate the exact focus of the problem statement before you start your research and, subsequently, the idea generation phase of the course. Compared to first year, you will be given greater agency in your research and choice of methods for problem solving, encouraging you and your team to work at a higher level of independence. You will be supported in your work by group coaches whom you will meet in fortnightly sessions to discuss your team's progress and any problems you may encounter. At a session half-way through the course, all teams will be given the opportunity to present their thinking so far and receive feedback on the plans for their projects.The final output will be presented to the external partner at the end of the course. Teams will have a choice in selecting a format for their final output, appropriate to their project's aims and approach (e.g., business-style report, process map, prototype with implementation plan). In addition to the group output, each student will submit an individual reflective piece to capture the learning on the challenge area, the process of responding to complex problems as member of a diverse team, and the individual contribution to the group project. The group output and the individual reflection together make up the assessment for the course (pass/fail, with both components having to be passed).",

    "course_description": "This course asks and answers the question 'what are the ethical implications of data, and how do they come to be?' The story of data reveals the moral and political values that shape human practices of counting, measuring, and labelling reality, and helps us better understand the growing power of data in today's world. Designed to engage students across the disciplines, this introductory course offers a foundational integration of basic concepts and methods of data science with the historical and philosophical context that reveals their ethical and political dimensions as inseparable from their scientific value. The course draws from the disciplines of philosophy, critical race and gender studies, sociology, history, mathematics, computer science and the design arts to build up a more comprehensive picture of how data are constructed, interpreted, shared and used for a growing range of scientific, commercial, public and creative purposes.The course content begins with a general introduction to the concept of data and its origins and uses, building up to an outline of the core data concepts and methods increasingly that increasingly shape contemporary society. In the second course phase, ethical and political theories of justice, power, bias, identity, consent, and rights, among others,  are used to further contextualise our relationships to data. The third phase reveals how unreflective views about the relationship between data and reality have often led to failed scientific endeavours and harmful social and political outcomes. In the fourth and final phase, students use the conceptual tools they have acquired to practice identifying and correcting these limited perspectives on data. (These four phases are overlapping and enmeshed, rather than cleanly demarcated; the progression represents the dominant theme/emphasis of each course phase). Throughout the course, 2 hour seminars are structured to accomplish 1) short (35-45 min) lectures on historical, moral and political context of a data practice; 2) an active discussion (45 minutes) of theoretical frames, concepts and critical tools from the reading as they apply to the practice; 3) presentation and discussion (15 min) of an artefact, technique or case study related to the data practice that will be the subject of tutorial group task (1 hour weekly).By engaging in discussion-centered seminars and, during non-teaching weeks, working collaboratively in tutorial groups on well-defined critical and analytical tasks related to the seminar content, students will experience the transformation from a passive understanding of data and a data-driven society, to a habit of active, collaborative and critical engagement with data and how they are constructed and used to promote particular social and political values, goals and arrangements. This habit is the cornerstone of the mature data philosophy that students will build throughout their EFI journey, as they acquire and practice the critical data skills needed for the responsible and trustworthy use of data across a wide range of academic and professional settings.",

    "course_description": "Reflections on Interdisciplinary Practice 2: Growing Confidence continues to support you in your academic and personal growth by giving you the space and tools to reflect on your learning and development from across the degree and beyond. It encourages you to compare, apply and test theories that allow you to synthesise the discrete components of the programme, and to share your reflections with your peers in order to deepen your insights as an interdisciplinary practitioner.Consolidating and building on the foundational skills and knowledge practices introduced in first year, you will be introduced to a wider range of theories and frameworks for reflection, goal setting and teamwork, encouraging you to compare them against each other and to select those that are most appropriate for your aims and projects.An additional aspect of personal growth in second year will be the introduction of training and application of basic peer mentoring techniques, in preparation for a role as mentor of first and second-year students that you may take on in your third year. There will also be an emphasis on building assessment literacy: you will learn tools and methods for self- and peer assessment (how to evaluate your own and other people's work against set criteria, how to give helpful feedback) and you will apply those in small groups of students to offer each other mutual support.One area of focus for the second semester will be understanding different approaches to standard setting and measurements of success, including assessment. This paves the way for transition into the honours level of study, when your work will be graded, contributing to your final degree classification. Other topics covered this year will include narratives of self; this will help you explore different ways of articulating your own experiences and value to other people (including on CVs and in letters of application). Comparison of different knowledge systems and how they are constructed across cultures as well as in historical perspective will allow you contextualise the different methodologies introduced in Researching Global Challenges and how they relate to the global challenge theme that is the focus of this year.Student Learning Experience:All components will be presented in a combination of theory and practice. Content will be introduced in weekly sessions offering a mix of presentations, video content, workshops and group discussions as well as time for individual reflection and writing. You will be asked to apply your learning to the other courses you are taking and to reflect on this experience, sharing your reflections in subsequent sessions to allow you to test the theoretical frameworks and deepening your insight. The sessions will be led by academic staff and/or peer mentors. At the beginning, middle and end of the year you will have individual and/or group meetings with a staff mentor to set your goals for the year and evaluate your progress against those goals.Assessment will take the form of a series of reflective submissions (e.g. blogs, vlogs, diaries) alongside more specific outputs (e.g. short essays on the theories introduced throughout the course, creative outputs, annotated CV, written feedback on own or another student's work), linked to the evidence portfolio used to provide appropriate evidence from other courses and activities (e.g. log of relevant activity, evaluation of submissions and personal goals).",

This course builds on research methods introduced in Researching Global Challenges 1, developing specialist skills and knowledge in interdisciplinary research.",
    "course_description": "This course continues to build the methodological 'toolbox' that you will require for interdisciplinary practice. It introduces a range of advanced and specialist skills that will help you to respond to key global challenges. A key feature of the course is the iterative approach to learning within diverse frameworks, which are introduced at Level 7 and continue to inform teaching through to honours years. For example, these might include: Data Collection; Data Analysis; Creative Practice; and Cultural Analysis. Global challenges can only be addressed by working together, finding shared approaches, and adapting to new situations. This course ensures a well-resourced and clearly structured progression of essential training in methods and approaches that will allow you to help create better futures.As with the pre-requisite Researching Global Challenges 1, this course is delivered through an innovative model using several concurrent 'workstations', located within the teaching space for weekly scheduled workshop activity. While the content and assessment will offer a clear progression, the structure will be consistent across the Level 7 and 8 courses and the two courses should be considered as complementary parts of the same learning experience. The course is divided into 'blocks', each of which presents a specific themed research question/enquiry. These will be pitched at an appropriate level and might involve a complex problem which impacts on society, the economy or the environment (for example, transitions to net-zero carbon, building a circular economy, or decolonising the city). In preparation for the workshops, you will engage with an online resource including video introductions, essential reading, and set questions. This is a 'flipped' approach that ensures a level of understanding and engagement before the active, task-based learning of the workshops. You will then complete all the blocks by visiting each of the workstations in turn. This will involve group activities applying key methods to the specific enquiry, promoted by task-sheets and facilitated by a tutor. In practice, this means that there will always be several workshops taking place at the same time, each of which will be facilitated by a tutor. Importantly, the content and approach emphasise the need to work together to explore challenges and teamwork will be required throughout the course.",

    "course_description": "This is a highly practical course where you will work in small groups of students from different disciplines to learn and apply the skills of being a 'change agent'.You will get training in core skills such as team working, problem solving and data analysis, and develop an understanding of the mindsets that underpin successful challenge-led learning such as confidence, innovation, resilience and integrity. You will research the context of a complex problem which impacts on society, the economy or the environment and gain a deeper understanding of the interdependency of local and global challenges. You will apply this learning to a live project proposed by an external partner, working collaboratively to develop innovative ideas to tackle the challenge. The experience will help and require you to reflect on your personal development and gain greater clarity on your values, skills and vision for your future. The challenge questions and external partners change every year; they might cover complex issues such as 'How do we improve the mental health of children living in Scotland?', 'How do we reduce food waste in the university's cafeterias?', or 'How might we address the lack of equality and diversity in the construction sector?'The course launches with a session where external partners outline the challenge. After that, students will spend the majority of their time working in groups to interrogate the data provided on the challenge they will be tackling, and to research the wider context from multidisciplinary angles, with the aim to develop and present innovative ideas to address the problem. Guided activities lead you through a design thinking process to help you develop creative responses and recommendations for the external partner. Groups are supported by coaches who will be at hand to answer questions. Groups will receive feedback on their projects from staff and peers throughout the course, and the external partners will also be available to answer questions. The final output will be a business style impact report outlining the group's thinking about the challenge project. This will be presented to the partner in an open forum where students will be encouraged to meet with representatives of the organisations that have provided the challenge topic.The business style report will also form part of the course's assessment, together with an individual reflection on the learning journey and how each student's research and skills development has contributed to the group project.In order to succeed on this course, students will need to be prepared to work in teams. This will include organising and allocating tasks to be completed by each team member, independently and reliably executing these tasks by set deadlines, and taking joint responsibility for dealing with problems within the team.Please Note:This is the credit-bearing version of a course that can also be taken as non-credit-bearing, extra-curricular activity through the 'Students as Change Agents' project offered by the Careers Service.",

Working in a small research team with the support of a supervisor, you will apply the skills and knowledge developed in pre-honours core courses to create a new research project in response to a selected global challenge. The course develops your advanced skills and knowledge in interdisciplinary research.",
    "course_description": "This course brings together skills and methods developed in the pre-honours courses for Edinburgh Futures Institute's undergraduate degree programme. You will work together in interdisciplinary teams to develop and apply a mixed methods approach to a selected research question, hypothesis, or enquiry, relating to a key global challenge. Groups will be comprised of students with emerging skills in diverse methods. These might include a combination of the categories introduced in the Researching Global Challenges courses (for example, Data Collection, Data Analysis, Creative Practice, and Cultural Analysis). Global challenges can only be addressed by working together, finding shared approaches, and adapting to new situations. This course requires application of interdisciplinary methods and practices that will equip you with the skills and experience you need to help create better futures.An important feature of this course is its flexible structure. Students on the programme may be spending a semester studying abroad. Taking place across both semesters, but with variation in key formative and summative assessment points, the course therefore offers you a degree of agency in finding the most effective supervision and meeting structure for the year. This may include a hybrid approach with a programme of in-person, online and asynchronous supervision and individual and group work. Early in the course, you will work with supervisors to agree a detailed timeline for progress towards flexible submission points. Progression through the course will be clearly structured through a series of tasks and submissions. The course will introduce a number of potential models and frameworks for developing a research project, as well as exploring broad topic areas that may inform the choice of project. Using a hybrid model, full class introduction and training sessions will be delivered, which may include further skills development in working with specific types of text, data and media. You will then complete a formative assignment individually exploring a potential topic and methodology. As research teams are created, you will be supported as you share ideas and approaches, leading to an agreed group project with clearly defined individual roles and responsibilities within a team structure. Groups will usually be comprised of 3-5 students and would only be outside this range in exceptional circumstances. A group presentation will take place midway through the agreed timeline and this will be centred around a hybrid event at the end of semester 1, which will include an asynchronous component for those who may be studying or working away at this point in the year. The final submission will be a co-authored paper submitted at the end of the course.It is recognised that group research at undergraduate level can be challenging and requires a flexible supervision process that ensures all students are well supported. This course is designed to ensure that all students can participate in a well-conceived and planned research project, learning to respond to complex global challenges through interdisciplinary collaboration.",

    "summary": "In this course you will critique and compare different approaches used for reflecting on and growing in interdisciplinary practice, helping you deepening your confidence and capacity for independently and flexibly working in interdisciplinary contexts. You will utilise your knowledge and experience in supporting juniors and peers in their development as interdisciplinary practitioners. Topics will include mentoring theories and techniques, enterprise and standard setting, and theories of interdisciplinarity.",
    "course_description": "In your third year of study, this course supports you in further developing the independence and critical insight needed to successfully complete the honours level of this interdisciplinary programme. This includes the introduction of new insight frameworks at higher level. For example, a spotlight on theories of interdisciplinary learning and research will help you put into perspective what you have learned about different discipline approaches and methodologies in year 1 and 2, allowing you to evaluate their usefulness in researching global challenges. You will dive deeper into theories and methods for solving problems, including wicked problems, and learn more about design thinking approaches to knowledge creation. You will continue with your reflections to help you integrate your learning from across the whole programme, but you will now be expected to compare and critique a range of reflective methods and approaches and select the most appropriate ones for a given context.A key focus in the second half of the year will be the preparation for the capstone project, the larger-scale research project that you will be undertaking in the final year of your studies. Utilising your knowledge of frameworks for goal setting and design thinking, you will start generating ideas and negotiate with other students and external (or internal) partners over the topic, scope and delivery for your (group or individual) project. The work you do in parallel in the other third year core course 'Interdisciplinary Research', will provide another basis for this thinking. During this process you will be able to identify any gaps in your learning or skills that you may still have to fill in order to start and successfully undertake the work on the capstone; this will help you with your course choice for the final year of the degree. Building on the work you have done on assessment literacy in second year, you will explore how assessment structures drive learning and behaviour (through setting and tracing of standards and performance indicators or measurements of success, in education settings but also beyond). Linking academic assessment with your own learning goals, you will contribute to the development of / co-create grading descriptors for your own and other students' projects; those descriptors will form a basis for the assessment of some of your work in fourth year (the capstone project). A key element in the area of personal growth this year will be the application of the mentoring skills and techniques you have started to build in year two and which will now be developed further and put into practice: you may start mentoring earlier years students, incoming cohorts of EFI undergraduate students, helping them in their transition through the early years of their studies.Student Learning Experience:The course will continue in the by now familiar structure of weekly seminar sessions where content is introduced and discussed in a mix of online material, presentations and workshop activities and which also allow time for individual and group reflection. Similarly, the assessment of the course will again capture and synthesise the learning from across the programme and take the form of a series of reflective submissions, linked with a portfolio used to provide appropriate evidence for relevant Learning Outcomes. In third year, this may include the outline of and reflection on a peer mentoring session, a set of rubrics for measuring success (KPIs - key performance indicators, or marking criteria), and critical reflections on theories of interdisciplinarity and their value for interdisciplinary practice as applied to this year's challenge theme.",

Students will use a wide range of personal and professional skills to adapt to unfamiliar contexts and environments, and demonstrate the ability to transfer learning and skills across these.Graduate attributes are closely linked to the learning outcomes, which have a degree of flexibility to provide students with autonomy. With appropriate guidance and feedback, this flexibility will allow students to focus on particular skills and mindsets in the context of different experiences, selecting specific attributes they consider the most important to reflect upon, linked to current and future professional and personal aims, and career aspirations.",

A series of specialist training workshops will be available, and you will be supported along the way by a dedicated supervisor.",
    "course_description": "This course provides the structure and support that you need to embark on a large-scale final project, which draws together all the learning that you have done across Edinburgh Futures Institute's Global Challenges degree programme. The course provides four distinct streams, one of which you will select at the beginning of the process. These are: Individual Dissertation, Group Dissertation, Individual Special Project and Group Special Project. The more conventional academic route of dissertations will be available individually or as a small research team completing a group project. A variety of other formats may also be possible, and you may wish to propose a film, a performance, an educational programme, a website, a portfolio, or any other form that will allow you to demonstrate your work. These options recognise that different students prefer to work in different ways and have distinct approaches to knowledge creation and dissemination. They also acknowledge a variety of pathways into employment or additional education. As such, you will be supported to select the most appropriate format to reflect your experience, skills and goals. You will also have the opportunity to negotiate the assessment structure, working with your supervisor to agree a plan for balancing individual and group assessment, critical argument and reflection, and peer and self-assessment. At this stage in the degree, you will be offered agency in designing and structuring your learning journey, allowing you to develop the skills to shape your own future.As with the Level 9 course on Interdisciplinary Research, the first part of this course is devoted to finalising group formation (for those students who have opted to work in that mode) and topic selection. This will be driven mainly by preferred stream and research interests, which will relate to a key global challenge. Proposals will be carefully considered by the supervision team and final approval must be provided before you can proceed with the research. It is important to ensure that you have the relevant skillset and support structure in place. Throughout the year, a series of workshops will be provided, and you will select from a list of training sessions offered as one-off opportunities from staff across the university. For example, these might include advanced data analysis, working with community groups, artistic skills training, or research ethics. These are offered as a mix of online and in person. Alongside these sessions, you will be allocated a supervisor to work with you on the development of your capstone project.

This project is your opportunity to bring together and apply all the insights and skills you have developed over the past years, to produce a piece of work that addresses some of the big challenges our world is facing and to help shape a better future. To help you with this, you will learn more about relevant cutting-edge theories and frameworks of thinking and knowledge creation, including, for example, networks of knowledge and 'futuring' methods.Another important element for this final year of your undergraduate studies will be the preparation for the time after graduation; you will be supported in this by a set of tasks and exercises that will help you in this key transition stage. This will include reflection on your values and aims for the future as well as - on a practical level - pulling together your portfolio of work and incorporating key examples into a CV that presents the depth and breadth of your experiences in the most effective way to prospective employers in different sectors. You will continue to develop your team working and mentoring skills by supporting groups of earlier years students, and you will contribute to the development of peer support structures and learning materials for future cohorts of EFI students. This will be done through a process of co-creation allowing you to use your experience gained over three to four years of learning to shape and further enhance the degree.Student Learning Experience:The course will be delivered in the now familiar structure, which might include a mix of presentations, workshops, peer support activities and time for individual work/reflection. You will continue to work on your portfolio; (group) coaching sessions at the start and mid-way through the academic year will help you identify your goals for the year (and beyond) as well as any potential gaps that still need to be filled. You will also have the opportunity to suggest additional workshop activities that will help you meet these goals and fill any gaps.Assessment will take the form of a series of reflective submissions linked with a portfolio used to provide appropriate evidence for relevant Learning Outcomes.

    "course_description": "The course will provide a theoretical framework based on empirical evidence showing how the experience of trauma on both an individual and societal level contributes to the emergence and maintenance of mental health difficulties. The course will give theoretical and clinical insights into how individuals experience traumatic and disrupting life events and how they can start to repair these ruptures. Two thirds of people who have mental ill health have a trauma background. We will further reflect on how wider structural and contextual vulnerabilities in our local and global societies contribute to this.Using this conceptual framework we will examine the lived experience of the two individuals captured in the documentary Love & Trouble. Two twenty year olds get married with high expectations and hidden pasts. As those pasts catch up with them, their mental health falls apart. Only when the young wife decides to overturn her reference points and wider societal expectations, is she able to make the conceptual shift 'that suffering is not a given', and learn that how you think about what has happened to you can open the way to new understanding, new behaviour, new mental habits.Trauma work can be seen as about layers of narratives - levels of re-enactment and unincorporated narratives, and the self-told story of the trauma can change by the end of treatment. This changed story then becomes something that can be shared, going from an uncontrollable visceral experience to a narrative that can be described.We invite students in this course to analyse and interrogate the role of the 'engaged observer' through the shared documentary screenings. There is space in this course to reflect how a narrative of resilience can contribute to our broader understanding of trauma and how it shapes society.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together.

    "summary": "This course introduces students to one of the most important challenges in academia and industry for making data-driven AI systems ethical: algorithmic bias. By drawing on interdisciplinary perspectives from computing, statistics, political and legal philosophy, and feminist theory, students will learn about current methods for improving fairness in AI and machine learning systems, as well as the limits and opportunities of algorithmic fairness in relation to the aims of social and distributive justice.",
    "course_description": "Data-driven machine learning systems learn from hidden patterns in existing data and risk reproducing and amplifying social patterns of bias reflected in this data, such as racial or gender bias. Algorithmic fairness is an emerging research area for removing these wrongful societal biases in the hope of making data-driven AI systems ethical. This course introduces students to issues of bias, fairness, and justice in data-driven machine learning systems by drawing on a diverse set of perspectives from computing, statistics, political and legal philosophy, and feminist theory in order to raise critical awareness and understanding of these issues as well as equipping students with tools to mitigate such problems.Topics include sources of bias in data and machine learning, methods for measuring and mitigating bias and unfairness, notions of individual and group fairness and the tensions between them, limitations of algorithmic fairness approaches, and philosophical accounts of distributive and structural justice relevant to machine learning systems. Learning in an innovative hybrid and intensive mode that brings together online and in-person students, you will work together in collaborative groups to practice the identification and evaluation of algorithmic bias concerns in concrete cases; students will also practice jointly deliberating about and communicating the benefits and limits of different methods, techniques and approaches to algorithmic fairness and justice.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together.

    "summary": "This course introduces students to one of the most important challenges in academia and industry for making data-driven AI systems ethical: algorithmic bias. By drawing on interdisciplinary perspectives from computing, statistics, political and legal philosophy, and feminist theory, students will learn about current methods for improving fairness in AI and machine learning systems, as well as the limits and opportunities of algorithmic fairness in relation to the aims of social and distributive justice.",
    "course_description": "Data-driven machine learning systems learn from hidden patterns in existing data and risk reproducing and amplifying social patterns of bias reflected in this data, such as racial or gender bias. Algorithmic fairness is an emerging research area for removing these wrongful societal biases in the hope of making data-driven AI systems ethical. This course introduces students to issues of bias, fairness, and justice in data-driven machine learning systems by drawing on a diverse set of perspectives from computing, statistics, political and legal philosophy, and feminist theory in order to raise critical awareness and understanding of these issues as well as equipping students with tools to mitigate such problems.Topics include sources of bias in data and machine learning, methods for measuring and mitigating bias and unfairness, notions of individual and group fairness and the tensions between them, limitations of algorithmic fairness approaches, and philosophical accounts of distributive and structural justice relevant to machine learning systems. Learning in an innovative hybrid and intensive mode that brings together online and in-person students, you will work together in collaborative groups to practice the identification and evaluation of algorithmic bias concerns in concrete cases; students will also practice jointly deliberating about and communicating the benefits and limits of different methods, techniques and approaches to algorithmic fairness and justice.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed. There will, however, be options to control whether or not your video and audio are enabled.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device.

    "course_description": "In the pre-intensive peropd, the opening lecture will introduce you to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the various options it provides for Storytelling. This is followed by a creativity workshop, which aims to ease you into the overall theme of the course. The idea is that you will take the skills and ideas developed there with you into the two days of intensive day workshops and the course projects. These projects primarily involve writing a story with the use of AI (no previous programming experience required).Most self study time, as well as the intensive day workshops, will have you working with a high level AI tool-set that has been custom made for the course (and which you can 'take home' when the course is over).In the intensive days, we will focus a bit more on some technical aspects of AI, helping you better understand how the tools you have been using work. At the same time, you will be invited to build AI solutions 'by hand', replicating the process Machine Learning algorithms go through. These days will culminate in collaborative activities using the tools you have been practising with in weeks prior, and testing the limits of their creative potential, while also exposing you to the dangers of their uncritical use.Evaluation will be undertaken via two pieces of coursework, at 20% and 80%, both of which follow a similar structure, with 85% of the mark attached to story generation exercises. Using the provided AI tool-set, you will be tasked with directing the AI into producing a story that accomplishes certain feats. The rest 15% of each coursework involves technical tasks related to AI engineering, such as working with code repositories or introductory level programming, and critique of provided examples.Following the intensive days, you will continue to self-study and work on the projects. A short series of invited lectures will run during this period, providing you with guidance on further possibilities for storytelling with AI, each focussing on a different AI area or application.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities.Students should be aware that:- Classrooms used in this course will have additional technology in place: students might not be able to sit in areas away from microphones or outside the field of view of all cameras.- Unless the lecturer or tutor indicates otherwise you should assume the session is being recorded.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device.

    "summary": "The climate emergency is a health emergency. The changing climate across the globe is impacting health directly through the immediate effects of adverse weather conditions causing illness, injury, and death, through ecosystem mediated effects including vector-borne diseases, water-borne diseases, mental health challenges, and malnutrition, and through socially mediated effects such as increased poverty, migration, and conflict.Not only will the health gains of the last 50 years be undermined as the severity of adverse climate events increase, but the very nature and types of diseases will change, with new emerging infections, antimicrobial resistance, and heightened likelihood of further pandemics. These risks threaten the economy of every country and global stability.  This course will examine how health systems can build resilience to climate change, and how the non-health sectors can protect the health of populations. A central focus will be on strategies to identify and build co-benefits from mitigation and adaptation interventions which simultaneously improve health outcomes and contribute to net zero targets.",
    "course_description": "This course provides an introduction to the ways in which the climate crisis has become a health emergency.  The actions taken to respond to the health emergency could, if comprehensive and innovative, be the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century.Students will:a) Examine the shifting narrative of the importance of health and climate from global bodies including the United Nations, the World Health Organisation, and national governments.b) Review the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on health including the immediate effects of adverse weather conditions such as storms, droughts, floods, cyclones, fires, heatwaves causing illness, injury and death; the ecosystem mediated effects of climate events including vector-borne diseases, water-borne diseases, mental health challenges, and malnutrition; and the socially mediated effects of these events such as increased poverty, migration, and conflict.c) Assess the risk and vulnerability factors which make those already most vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change most at risk of health challenges.d) Understand the implications of the changing health metrics on social and economic stability.e) Identify current co-benefits and design for new untapped co-benefits of actions which simultaneously improve health outcomes and contribute to net zero targets.The learning experience will be characterised by co-creation and peer-teaching with students actively engaged in generating materials that inform their fellow-students. A range of learning products and inputs, including from global thought leaders, will be utilised with a supportive environment where there can be provocation, dialogue, and expansive thinking looking at old solutions for these new intersectoral challenges and new solutions delivered in different ways.The course will make use of a range of digital learning environments, enabling students to build knowledge across discussion forums, livestreamed sessions, and other collaborative networked spaces.This course will have broad appeal to students with both humanities and science qualifications and those interested/currently employed in careers across business (especially working in ESG) and in public health, animal and environmental health, and global governance.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together.

    "summary": "The climate emergency is a health emergency. The changing climate across the globe is impacting health directly through the immediate effects of adverse weather conditions causing illness, injury, and death, through ecosystem mediated effects including vector-borne diseases, water-borne diseases, mental health challenges, and malnutrition, and through socially mediated effects such as increased poverty, migration, and conflict.Not only will the health gains of the last 50 years be undermined as the severity of adverse climate events increase, but the very nature and types of diseases will change, with new emerging infections, antimicrobial resistance, and heightened likelihood of further pandemics. These risks threaten the economy of every country and global stability. This course will examine how health systems can build resilience to climate change, and how the non-health sectors can protect the health of populations. A central focus will be on strategies to identify and build co-benefits from mitigation and adaptation interventions which simultaneously improve health outcomes and contribute to net zero targets.",

Key to the methodological underpinnings of this work will be a Participatory Design Futuring approach, where students are invited to explore and expand on participatory design methods with children in speculative, future-focussed ways.The course will be delivered across two main topics:1) Understanding Children, Interaction and Design (Conceptual/Theoretical)The first part of the course will introduce key theory on children, interaction and design, drawing from multiple disciplines, such as Human-Computer Interaction, Child-Computer Interaction, Education, Accessibility, Design and Computer Science.

First critiquing literature and international projects around 'The Creative city', the course, envisioned as an urban studio, then explores locally based creative activities, groups and their associated place(s) in the city as a site-based case study. Group work traverses documentation in situ and remotely gathered knowledge from planning documents, media comment and creative activity narratives.  Site stories and spatial studies can reveal incidents, qualities and constituents of strategic and tactical urban project negotiation and agency.Interrogating cities as creative sites: through site-based case studies of cultural projects, events, urban spaces and discourses.",
    "course_description": "It has been argued that sites are 'brought under control' for development through intervention or action being situated in a (usually professional) discourse, while other qualities and narratives are suppressed (Beauregard, in Burns and Kahn, ed. Site Matters 2020).  A recent dominant discourse has concerned 'The Creative city', solidified in UNESCO's Creative City Network (UCCN, since 2004). Studying shifts from places to sites again becoming places is a way of revealing more nuanced narratives (site stories) of how creative activity is entangled with the urban (spatial studies). Case studies will accumulate into an archive that questions what makes a city, or place(s) in a city an existing, potential or redundant 'creative' site.In the course you will assemble and evaluate site stories and spatial studies of urban creative activity - for example cases of established festivals or community arts events or proto-cultural institutions and infrastructures. You will have opportunity to research, evaluate and critique an international case study (pre-intensive phase, desk based) before focusing on an Edinburgh case study (intensive phase, site based, virtual and in-situ). Groups will be formed to include remote and Edinburgh-based participants who work synchronously during the intensive phase on the locally based case study. Site knowledge is developed through the lens of both proximity of encounter (audio, visual and fieldwork documentation in situ) and remote practice (gathered knowledge from planning documents, media comment and creative activity narratives). Presentations of findings are exchanged between the site and a digital forum, with remote students presenting virtually 'on-site' and Edinburgh-based students presenting 'off-site'.You will be introduced to the discourse of The Creative City and UCCN from academics across disciplines such as History/theory of Art and Urban Studies. Approaches to exploratory urban methodologies (site stories, spatial studies) will be guided by academics with practice-based expertise in Architecture, Cultural Geography, Literature Studies.

    "summary": "Edinburgh is a site of prolific, diverse and sometimes contested cultural events and discourses. First critiquing literature and international projects around 'The Creative city', the course, envisioned as an urban studio, then explores locally based creative activities, groups and their associated place(s) in the city as a site-based case study. Group work traverses documentation in situ and remotely gathered knowledge from planning documents, media comment and creative activity narratives.  Site stories and spatial studies can reveal incidents, qualities and constituents of strategic and tactical urban project negotiation and agency.Interrogating cities as creative sites: through site-based case studies of cultural projects, events, urban spaces and discourses.",
    "course_description": "It has been argued that sites are 'brought under control' for development through intervention or action being situated in a (usually professional) discourse, while other qualities and narratives are suppressed (Beauregard, in Burns and Kahn, ed. Site Matters 2020).  A recent dominant discourse has concerned 'The Creative city', solidified in UNESCO's Creative City Network (UCCN, since 2004). Studying shifts from places to sites again becoming places is a way of revealing more nuanced narratives (site stories) of how creative activity is entangled with the urban (spatial studies). Case studies will accumulate into an archive that questions what makes a city, or place(s) in a city an existing, potential or redundant 'creative' site.In the course you will assemble and evaluate site stories and spatial studies of urban creative activity - for example cases of established festivals or community arts events or proto-cultural institutions and infrastructures. You will work in groups to research, evaluate and critique an international case study (pre-intensive phase, desk based) before focusing on an Edinburgh case study (intensive phase, site based- virtual and in-situ). Groups will be formed to include remote and Edinburgh-based participants who work synchronously during the intensive phase on the locally based case study. Site knowledge is developed through the lens of both proximity of encounter (audio, visual and fieldwork documentation in situ) and remote practice (gathered knowledge from planning documents, media comment and creative activity narratives). Presentations of findings are exchanged between the site and a digital forum, with remote students presenting virtually 'on-site' and Edinburgh-based students presenting 'off-site'.You will be introduced to the discourse of The Creative City and UCCN from academics across disciplines such as History/theory of Art and Urban Studies. Approaches to exploratory methodologies (site stories, spatial studies) will be guided by academics with practice-based expertise in Architecture, Cultural Geography, Literature Studies. The course aims to foster a critical imagination through visual experimentation and multi-media techniques. A video-making and visual documentation workshop in the intensive phase of the course will support group and individual documentation skills.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together.

This course proposes that these concerns, while not irrelevant, are inadequate; for the problem of inequality does not only lie in 'bad data' but in the notion of data itself.This course interrogates data as a colonial phenomenon produced by epistemic difference - i.e., by inequalities and exclusions regarding what counts as knowing and acting in this world.

We will explore concrete policies and projects affecting social, political, and economic inequality through the critical examination of texts, speeches, cases, and datasets.",
    "course_description": "The substantive content of the course will change each year depending on topical issues and will be taught by experts on the issue itself or on particular approaches/ methods from amongst permanent and postdoctoral staff. For example, around a UN development agenda or a comparative perspective on an issue covering a particular set of countries or regions, or on a theme that has attracted activism.In each case, students will learn substantive information about the topic itself but perhaps more importantly they will acquire and develop key skills to analyse inequalities from a different perspective: how to place an inequality case within a larger context, where to look for information about context, the types of variables (whether social, economic, cultural, or political) to consider when analysing the phenomenon, how to identify wider theories and concepts to analyse the phenomenon and how to acquire evidence that would support one theoretical interpretation over another.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together.

Leaders rely on data to generate new opportunities, shift objectives, and track the effectiveness of their strategies and programs.

The analysis will be in the form of a slide deck, combining narratives with data visualisations. This format will help students prepare them to engage with creative and cultural organisation stakeholders.The course includes some tutorials on financial statements and budgeting - optional for students with a business background, mandatory for those without.This course is taught intensively, with the scheduled teaching in two 1-day workshops, over a two-week period.",

    "course_description": "There is now a rich and detailed literature on the nature of inequalities in the cultural and creative industries. Whether at global, regional, or national level, it is clear that the production and consumption of culture is highly exclusive. At the same time, research on equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in cultural and creative industries, particularly on 'what works' to promote and support EDI, is still in an emerging or early phase.This research base can be contrasted with the extensive attempts by organisations, policymakers, and businesses to address and combat inequalities. Critical Creative Diversity is situated in this space, between the academic understanding of inequality, the emerging understanding of approaches to effective equality, diversity, and inclusion, and the need to be critical of current sector and organisational practice.The course syllabus is based on a teaching block of 5 weeks, divided into three parts.Part 1 is based on students acquiring knowledge of current inequalities in cultural and creative industries, supported by the course leader and teaching assistant, along with their classmates.Part 2, structured around 2 days of intensive teaching, will allow students to think about the current practice of equality, diversity, and inclusion, both in the context of case studies, masterclass guest lectures, and the construction of policy reports and organisational EDI plans.Part 3 focuses on a critical investigation as to what works to support an effective EDI policy for a case study sector or organisation within the cultural and creative industries. This final phase of the course produces the assessment submission.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together.

    "summary": "How can creative organisations address inequality?  In Critical Creative Diversity we will explore the potential, and the limits, of equality, diversity, and inclusion to challenge and change the cultural and creative world.",
    "course_description": "There is now a rich and detailed literature on the nature of inequalities in the cultural and creative industries. Whether at global, regional, or national level, it is clear that the production and consumption of culture is highly exclusive. At the same time, research on equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in cultural and creative industries, particularly on 'what works' to promote and support EDI, is still in an emerging or early phase.This research base can be contrasted with the extensive attempts by organisations, policymakers, and businesses to address and combat inequalities. Critical Creative Diversity is situated in this space, between the academic understanding of inequality, the emerging understanding of approaches to effective equality, diversity, and inclusion, and the need to be critical of current sector and organisational practice.The course syllabus is based on a teaching block of 5 weeks, divided into three parts.Part 1 is based on students acquiring knowledge of current inequalities in cultural and creative industries, supported by the course leader and teaching assistant, along with their classmates.Part 2, structured around 2 days of intensive teaching, will allow students to think about the current practice of equality, diversity, and inclusion, both in the context of case studies, masterclass guest lectures, and the construction of policy reports and organisational EDI plans.Part 3 focuses on a critical investigation as to what works to support an effective EDI policy for a case study sector or organisation within the cultural and creative industries. This final phase of the course produces the assessment submission.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed. There will, however, be options to control whether or not your video and audio are enabled.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.",

In this sense, heritage and education are closely linked, and heritage studies can give us great insight into how futures - including informal learning futures - are made and shared. Richard Sandford argues that heritage has a vital role to play in the creation of 'lived futures' which give 'social, natural, technological structures'... room to unfold' (2019, p.75). These insights, and others, provide a foundation for this course, which is about the role of cultural heritage in helping us create futures for learning that are 'lived' and not 'empty'.The course is organised into pre-intensive, 2-day intensive, and post-intensive activity. The pre-intensive period will involve reading around key concepts, and activities involving representations of education futures, and a heritage thinking task.The two-day intensive period will involve engaging with tangible and intangible heritage in a collaborative, creative, critical way that provides a deep foundation for a story from the future that each participant will create. Working in and with museums, galleries, libraries and archives, we will examine histories of the future and consider how various forms of learning futures have been expressed. Key methodological concepts and some 'future lifelong education' themes will be introduced in guest lectures, students will take part in a workshop led by cultural heritage professionals, and will engage in individual and group work exploring knowledge futures and scoping stories from the future.Building on the intensive period, in the post-intensive students will take part in a self-paced museum field trip (virtually, in their own location, or in Edinburgh), and will design their own speculative 'lived future' stories of lifelong learning, receiving peer feedback and submitting this 3 weeks after the intensive period takes place (see assessment below).Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together.

In this frame, ethics and data are not separate but intertwined by technique-ethics as a social body of techniques for living well together, and techniques of data-driven science and engineering as socially constructed means of building values into our future lived worlds. We consider the relationship of data and AI to ethics in the practical domains of engineering, criminal justice and healthcare. In what ways are data and algorithmic systems essential to our practices of designing and delivering safe environments, just sentences, or human health? Conversely, we examine how ethical values, virtues and duties of care can guide responsible and sustainable research and innovation with data and AI, for example: justice, fairness, privacy, safety, integrity, accountability, humility and respect for human dignity.The aim of the course is to enable you to acquire practical methods, skills and techniques for accomplishing this alignment, individually and in teams. You'll learn about tools like model cards and datasheets, practice building ethical risk and threat models, and co-develop ethical design briefs and/or ethical research or product reviews. Coursework is focused on case studies that explore ethical data practices and challenges directly relevant to data and AI professionals in academic, private and public sectors.This course will be taught in a hybrid and intensive format starting with an asynchronous flexible learning 'immersion' phase. Here you will explore texts and videos that introduce you to key concepts, methods and techniques for ethical practices that foster responsible data and AI research and innovation, and work with others to analyse a concrete case study in preparation for the intensive phase. This is followed by a 2-day intensive 'fusion' workshop where you will benefit from a mix of lectures, group exercises and reflection activities designed to integrate and strengthen your practical skills in collaborative data/AI ethics.

Students learn how ethical and legal norms can steer the production and use of these technologies to align with justice and the reduction of harm, as well as the realisation of benefits for individuals and society. Through collaboration exercises, students practice working with others to govern these technologies wisely and well, while coming to understand today's most significant challenges for effective AI and data governance.",
    "course_description": "This course explores the intersection of AI and other data-intensive technologies with law, ethics, policy and other modes of technology governance. Drawing from the disciplines of law, philosophy and political theory, the course will explore how data and AI practice is enabled, constrained, contested and steered by governance frameworks that reflect broad social expectations, individual and group rights, local and cultural norms, public policy, political and economic incentives. Students will gain a high-level overview of the most common ethical theories and principles used in the context of AI and data governance, while also learning how Data Protection, Intellectual Property, and human rights law function as legal approaches to regulating control and power over data, AI and its uses. We will explore how these ethical and legal frameworks, (as well as policy and other governance instruments) shape AI and data-driven research, commerce and innovation, and how they respond (or fail to respond) to wider ethical, social, and political concerns.  We will also explore how the design and deployment choices of technologists themselves generate governing power, and the questions this raises about democratic legitimacy and authority.Students will work individually, in small groups and as an entire class on two complex data-driven innovation proposals that raise a number of legal and ethical issues. Students will learn together to: identify key ethical issues as well as legal concerns; use existing frameworks such as data protection regulation, human rights law, data ethics, algorithmic justice and responsible AI standards to articulate these concerns; weigh and propose potential governance solutions; and identify gaps, value conflicts and political obstacles to effective AI and data governance.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together.

Students learn how ethical and legal norms can steer the production and use of these technologies to align with justice and the reduction of harm, as well as the realisation of benefits for individuals and society. Through collaboration exercises, students practice working with others to govern these technologies wisely and well, while coming to understand today's most significant challenges for effective AI and data governance.",
    "course_description": "This course explores the intersection of AI and other data-intensive technologies with law, ethics, policy and other modes of technology governance. Drawing from the disciplines of law, philosophy and political theory, the course will explore how data and AI practice is enabled, constrained, contested and steered by governance frameworks that reflect broad social expectations, individual and group rights, local and cultural norms, public policy, political and economic incentives. Students will gain a high-level overview of the most common ethical theories and principles used in the context of AI and data governance, while also learning how Data Protection, Intellectual Property, and human rights law function as legal approaches to regulating control and power over data, AI and its uses. We will explore how these ethical and legal frameworks, (as well as policy and other governance instruments) shape AI and data-driven research, commerce and innovation, and how they respond (or fail to respond) to wider ethical, social, and political concerns. We will also explore how the design and deployment choices of technologists themselves generate governing power, and the questions this raises about democratic legitimacy and authority.Students will work individually, in small groups and as an entire class on two complex data-driven innovation proposals that raise a number of legal and ethical issues. Students will learn together to: identify key ethical issues as well as legal concerns; use existing frameworks such as data protection regulation, human rights law, data ethics, algorithmic justice and responsible AI standards to articulate these concerns; weigh and propose potential governance solutions; and identify gaps, value conflicts and political obstacles to effective AI and data governance.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed. There will, however, be options to control whether or not your video and audio are enabled.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.",

COVID has brought large scale changes to our expectations of working and community life, pivoted many activities to online-first, and reintroduced people to their local area - alongside the challenges of climate change, and economics shifts that threaten to increase social inequality.The responsibility for seizing the opportunities of this moment to address some perennial 'wicked problems' fall not only on government and corporations, but also on civil society at a local level.  How can we use data-driven methods to make sense of local issues and to use this understanding to design better interventions that support constructive change? As a marketplace for ideas about how to generate positive social change, civil society is ever dynamic, and students will gain an understanding of how it emerges and evolves at a local level.This course will teach you some critical concepts and new skills that allow you to engage in existing projects that contribute to building and deepening relationships with community organisations and activists.",

    "summary": "The data-driven society compels a new appreciation of relations between the three branches of government (i.e. the legislature, executive, and judiciary). This course will instil that appreciation by providing a brief introduction to the public law principles which govern decision-making in the public sector, their underlying political philosophy (why they are the way they are), and how certain results from the field of 'human factors' engineering suggest that the automation of government functions could fall foul of these principles. It will both stretch students' analytical powers and stimulate their imagination by encouraging them to develop their own responses to the challenges which AI and data pose to legitimacy, democracy, rights, and procedural justice.",
    "course_description": "Traditionally, courts are seen to be the final arbiters of law's content and upholders of human rights and the rule of law. The democratic impulse of a society is channelled instead through deliberative assemblies of elected officials who, in turn, determine who governs and delegate power to various unelected officials to help them cope with the business of government. On the traditional view, courts function as a check on the power of these unelected officials. But the data-driven society raises certain questions about how courts are best to do this. Data-driven societies often replace unelected officials with unelectable AI systems. The principles of law forming what is called \"administrative law\" dictate how courts are to regulate the actions of government officials, and these principles (like due process) are likely to prohibit many uses of AI-including, crucially, beneficial ones.The course will examine three ways in which the relationship between rights and democracy can be said to change in the wake of the data revolution: (i) the claims of the citizen expand, in both public and private domains, to encompass such relatively novel rights as those of data access, correction, and erasure; (ii) the power of the state also expands, along with the potential for its abuse, hence the conflict between rights and democracy intensifies; and (iii) the beneficial potential of data-driven applications in government forces a fresh appraisal of the relationship between rights and democracy. For example, when the tenets of due process require that government decision-making be 'rational,' even when beneficial data-driven algorithms employed by the state are 'irrational', by human standards, we have a conflict between rights (in the form of rights to due process) and democracy (in the form of elected officials authorising the use of data-driven technologies in the public service).And it's just not clear that the pre-data paradigm of judicial review is adequate to resolve this conflict. The course will therefore provide an introduction to the principles of public law/judicial review (due process, etc.) and and interrogate the distinction between 'public' and 'private' power. It will also provide a basic introduction to key findings in 'human factors' engineering and human-computer interaction, which suggest that owing to the relationship public servants may develop with technology, automation of government functions may breach several public law principles. (3) Student learning experience. Students will hear brief lectures, interspersed with small-group and whole-cohort activities, including: Q&As concerning real court decisions from various jurisdictions to see how courts around the world are grappling with these issues; watching and/or hearing and commenting upon relevant videos and/or podcasts; and performing a mock consultancy brief. Learning in an innovative hybrid and intensive ('fusion') mode that brings together online and in-person students, students will work together to formulate principled policy positions on the issues canvassed in the course.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together.

    "summary": "The data-driven society compels a new appreciation of relations between the three branches of government (i.e. the legislature, executive, and judiciary). This course will instil that appreciation by providing a brief introduction to the public law principles which govern decision-making in the public sector, their underlying political philosophy (why they are the way they are), and how certain results from the field of 'human factors' engineering suggest that the automation of government functions could fall foul of these principles. It will both stretch students' analytical powers and stimulate their imagination by encouraging them to develop their own responses to the challenges which AI and data pose to legitimacy, democracy, rights, and procedural justice.",
    "course_description": "Traditionally, courts are seen to be the final arbiters of law's content and upholders of human rights and the rule of law. The democratic impulse of a society is channelled instead through deliberative assemblies of elected officials who, in turn, determine who governs and delegate power to various unelected officials to help them cope with the business of government. On the traditional view, courts function as a check on the power of these unelected officials. But the data-driven society raises certain questions about how courts are best to do this. Data-driven societies often replace unelected officials with unelectable AI systems. The principles of law forming what is called \"administrative law\" dictate how courts are to regulate the actions of government officials, and these principles (like due process) are likely to prohibit many uses of AI-including, crucially, beneficial ones.The course will examine three ways in which the relationship between rights and democracy can be said to change in the wake of the data revolution: (i) the claims of the citizen expand, in both public and private domains, to encompass such relatively novel rights as those of data access, correction, and erasure; (ii) the power of the state also expands, along with the potential for its abuse, hence the conflict between rights and democracy intensifies; and (iii) the beneficial potential of data-driven applications in government forces a fresh appraisal of the relationship between rights and democracy. For example, when the tenets of due process require that government decision-making be 'rational,' even when beneficial data-driven algorithms employed by the state are 'irrational', by human standards, we have a conflict between rights (in the form of rights to due process) and democracy (in the form of elected officials authorising the use of data-driven technologies in the public service).And it's just not clear that the pre-data paradigm of judicial review is adequate to resolve this conflict. The course will therefore provide an introduction to the principles of public law/judicial review (due process, etc.) and and interrogate the distinction between 'public' and 'private' power. It will also provide a basic introduction to key findings in 'human factors' engineering and human-computer interaction, which suggest that owing to the relationship public servants may develop with technology, automation of government functions may breach several public law principles. (3) Student learning experience. Students will hear brief lectures, interspersed with small-group and whole-cohort activities, including: Q&As concerning real court decisions from various jurisdictions to see how courts around the world are grappling with these issues; watching and/or hearing and commenting upon relevant videos and/or podcasts; and performing a mock consultancy brief. Learning in an innovative hybrid and intensive ('fusion') mode that brings together online and in-person students, students will work together to formulate principled policy positions on the issues canvassed in the course.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed. There will, however, be options to control whether or not your video and audio are enabled.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device.

    "course_description": "In this course, students will learn to understand and appraise ecocities and urban sustainability through the core social science concepts of political ecology, urban metabolism, travelling policy, green gentrification and environmental racism.Around the world, there are multiple attempts to produce sustainable urban forms. From redeveloped eco-districts, greening initiatives, and 20-minute neighbourhoods, to the construction of entirely new, master-planned cities, urban sustainability has been interpreted in diverse ways and produced different definitions, typologies, practices and results. In this course, students will gain in-depth knowledge of the concept of urban sustainability and the underlying ambitions, assumptions, agendas and initiatives that have been inaugurated around the world in efforts to produce sustainable urban forms.Awareness of different approaches is insufficient, however. Students will be equipped with critical tools and concepts that will enable them to critically examine and analyse various urban sustainability initiatives. Sustainability has to encompass multiple measurements and factors, including inclusivity, equity, community, dignified livelihoods and democracy. The course will therefore emphasise the linkages between these ideals and urban sustainability, and push students to critique existing practices, as well as think about future projects/initiatives in these terms. Pathways to sustainability are also shaped by the socio-political contexts in which they are implemented. The role market forces, public-private-partnerships, communities and political contestation play in shaping urban sustainability projects and their outcomes will be foregrounded to enhance students' analytical frameworks.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together.

    "course_description": "Economists conventionally conceive of humans as rational agents making objective decisions that will maximise their rewards. In recent years, though, important research in the humanities and social sciences has shown how - under real-world conditions of limited information and uncertainty - economic actors in fact rely on narratives to explain their situations and guide their actions.The course will explore how economic data can be interpreted to construct varying narratives, and how these narratives may - in turn - shape economic reality itself as businesses, consumers, investors, journalists, or policymakers buy into them and spread their effects.The first main strand of the course will draw on research in economic sociology and anthropology to examine case studies of the power of economic narrative in action, focusing on the operations of institutions and actors such as central banks, financial analysts, and business journalists. We'll consider how the goal of the stories these bodies and individuals tell is not so much to be 'true' as to appear coherent, plausible, credible, and persuasive - in the hope of ultimately bringing economic reality into line with their versions of events.The second main strand will begin by considering how the narrow understanding of human psychology long-dominant in mainstream economics has recently been challenged by the rise of behavioural economics, with its emphasis on the limitations of economic actors' calculative decision-making. It will go on to explore attempts in what's called the 'Economic Humanities' to go a stage further by highlighting how reading fictional narratives offers models for understanding the full complexity of human motivation, including our tendency to make decisions actively at odds with our apparent self-interest.Through a combination of assigned theoretical and case study reading; online lecturing and interaction; large and small group discussion during Intensive days; and analysis of historical and/or contemporary real-world examples, students will learn to identify, analyse, interpret, and critically reflect upon the narratives that shape the economic world. Case studies can include (but will not be limited to, or be required to include for every iteration of the course):(a) The manner in which economic metrics are used to create narratives of such hard to define concepts as economic success, failure, development, modernity, bubbles, and crashes, and in turn to influence public understanding of economic issues and controversies, and the formulation of economic policy. Some very basic explanation of essential economic statistics and economic time series will be provided, from the venerable GDP per capita measure, to the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals and later the Sustainable Development Goals, but no mathematical skills will be necessary for students to follow this discussion. The aim is rather to develop a critical attitude to economic data and especially the way metrics are used to promote narratives like economic modernity and the 'reform' needed to achieve it (e.g. the 'Washington Consensus'), globalisation and its inevitability/desirability, or moral vs utilitarian dilemmas like the 'public health vs economic prosperity' narrative current during the 2020-21 pandemic.(b) The manner in which narratives of financial bubbles and crashes can be developed from traditional storytelling devices of \"greed vs fear,\" \"hubris,\" \"rags-to-riches-to-rags,\" or \"the madness of crowds\" and into a heuristic device by which concepts which have no consensus definition can be approached and analysed in lieu of a formal theory.

It will get you thinking about the role of education in addressing society's most complex, wicked problems. We know there is a great deal of uncertainty and volatility facing us: is the answer to our complex problems more and better education? This course will help us explore this question in a critical, engaging and collaborative way.",
    "course_description": "The prescription to remedy many of society's most pressing problems usually includes more or better education - for example the lack of action to address the climate emergency produces calls for more scientific literacy, the spread of disinformation online creates demand for more digital literacy, and toxic nationalism, we are told, is solved by better history education. But, within existing educational paradigms, are such calls realistic? This course posits that educating for the future requires the rethinking of education as a silver bullet solution. There are many systemic features of education that limit its potential to deliver answers. For example, the most complex or 'wicked' problems now facing humanity defy existing disciplinary boundaries. Yet, young scholars, from secondary school onwards, are obliged to specialise more at every stage of their education. To such specialists, especially within STEM subjects, social problems can look like engineering or technical problems that can be understood through data science and designed away with behaviour-change technology. Yet we need specialisation before it becomes expertise. How can such tensions be addressed?Drawing on the facet methodology developed at the National Centre for Research Methods, this course is a practical intervention, involving engaging lectures and seminars, intensive group discussion, and collaborative development of educational responses and critical approaches to futures work. The facet methodology is a metaphor for addressing problems from different perspectives to muster as many insights as possible. It will synthesize educational and social theory, the latest research and pedagogy, digital methods and sources of data to facilitate a structured, collaborative, interdisciplinary and innovative educational approach to rethinking education in light of society's wicked problems. To activate the facet methodology during this course, we offer problems that challenge disciplinary boundaries and require critical and creative interdisciplinary thinking to a) scope the problem and b) provide possible educational responses. Using facilities, concepts, methods and techniques, the course will scaffold students' response to these questions and allow them to produce some radical educational thinking.For example, the problem of disinformation on the internet is different in different in cultures; it is a technical problem for computer scientists, a problem for psychologists  and sociologists but also requires an understanding of national cultures, international relations and the political economy of capitalism. For example, the UK government can do little to regulate companies that are based in the USA. The facet method requires contributions for all these various ways of understanding the world to get the complete picture.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities.Students should be aware that:- Classrooms used in this course will have additional technology in place: students might not be able to sit in areas away from microphones or outside the field of view of all cameras.- Unless the lecturer or tutor indicates otherwise you should assume the session is being recorded.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.",

It will get you thinking about the role of education in addressing society's most complex, wicked problems. We know there is a great deal of uncertainty and volatility facing us: is the answer to our complex problems more and better education? This course will help us explore this question in a critical, engaging and collaborative way.",
    "course_description": "The prescription to remedy many of society's most pressing problems usually includes more or better education - for example the lack of action to address the climate emergency produces calls for more scientific literacy, the spread of disinformation online creates demand for more digital literacy, and toxic nationalism, we are told, is solved by better history education. But, within existing educational paradigms, are such calls realistic? This course posits that educating for the future requires the rethinking of education as a silver bullet solution. There are many systemic features of education that limit its potential to deliver answers. For example, the most complex or 'wicked' problems now facing humanity defy existing disciplinary boundaries. Yet, young scholars, from secondary school onwards, are obliged to specialise more at every stage of their education. To such specialists, especially within STEM subjects, social problems can look like engineering or technical problems that can be understood through data science and designed away with behaviour-change technology. Yet we need specialisation before it becomes expertise. How can such tensions be addressed?Drawing on the facet methodology developed at the National Centre for Research Methods, this course is a practical intervention, involving engaging lectures and seminars, intensive group discussion, and collaborative development of educational responses and critical approaches to futures work.

Students will be able to access academic input, support materials, and guidance to devise initial ideas for their plans, which should involve change in an educational setting. The academic input will include reading and recorded input on theories of change, the role of educators in both shaping and responding to change, the drivers and primary areas of change in education in today's world, and on the intersection between data, networks, and educational change.Support materials will include case studies of change projects (examples will also be presented to the students during the intensive week), as well as on-line tools for change projects (e.g. the Agents of Change Toolkit (ACT) for schools (agentsofchangetoolkit.org), and the log for Teacher Reflection on their Agency for Change (TRAC) (reflective-teacher.net)).Finally, guidance will be provided for students to apply any data skills they have acquired in other EFI courses to their planned change projects. In particular, ACT toolkit guides users through 5 steps of the process of change towards the achievment of SDGs that will be followed over 5 weeks of the course as follows:Week 1:In week 1 students will identify an area of change or improvement they would like to propose in their chosen setting. They will be encouraged to write a blog and share their initial ideas with peers and tutors, as well as use chat rooms and fora to comment on each other's ideas and blog posts.Week 2:In week 2 students will use TRAC log to map their support networks for change and gage diverse actors' perspectives. They will also attend sessions covering the use of data for evaluating and understanding change processes.Week 3:Week 3 will focus on devising a plan of action. Students will be encouraged to bring a draft plan of action which they will have an opportunity to present, discuss, get feedback on during the intensive component.In the intensive period of the course (in week 3), students will be able to engage directly with examples of case studies of change projects, pitch their own budding change project plans, and network with their peers to build student teams.The intensive period will be followed by a post-intensive component, where students will work to revise their change plans in the light of feedback from peers and staff.Week 4:In week 4 they will elaborate their plans further using an on-line platform to collaborate within their teams to discuss common issues, and give and receive constructive feedback. Students will be encouraged to peer-review each other's written plans and suggest areas of improvement. Each student group will be facilitated by a member of staff.Week 5:In week 5 students will revise their change plans, including any data they would use or collect to evaluate the impact of their change projects.

The course is interdisciplinary, critical, collaborative and creative in approach, drawing on social science, literary and design-based approaches.Students on the course will experience hands-on social science research, media-rich fusion teaching environments, collaborative design, and engagement with relevant literary texts, building towards the production of a group research presentation and an individual 'social science fiction' demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of the implications of personalisation and surveillance for education in the future.The course is organized as an intensive teaching model. Activities prior to intensive week include 2x scheduled online lectures (0.5hrs) (delivered live and recorded), 2x scheduled synchronous videoconference seminars (1hr), assigned reading, and asynchronous discussion forum. During the intensive week, students will experience 2-days of hybrid on-campus/online teaching:Day One:-  Short, live and recorded lecture by course leader introducing key themes and purposes of intensive activities.-  Seminar (facilitated on-campus and online) focused on critically examining educational technologies.-  Facilitated collaborative research activity, with on-campus and online students organised in small working groups to critically examine an educational technology (groups and topics specified in advance during pre-intensive phase).Day Two:-  Joint development of research presentation based on collaborative research project from day one, with all presentations (online and on-campus) recorded and captured for formative assessment and asynchronous peer feedback.-  Seminar session to highlight overall issues arising from technologies of personalisation and surveillance, with collaborative development of alternative proposals and designs.- Lecture and creative workshop on writing research-based 'social science fiction', leading to post-intensive individual activity.Post-intensive activities include scheduled 1x seminar (1hr), group task, independent study, creative textual production of individual social science fiction texts, asynchronous online discussion, and peer feedback.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course.

    "summary": "This course enables students to critically examine the origins and effects of personalisation and surveillance in education. It will enable students to develop creative, collaborative and research-informed alternative visions for the future uses of digital technologies and data in education.",
    "course_description": "'Education, Personalisation and Surveillance' explores profound changes in education systems and teaching and learning practices associated with data-driven and AI-based technologies, from formal settings to professional learning contexts and non-formal sites of learning. The course is interdisciplinary, critical, collaborative and creative in approach, drawing on social science, literary and design-based approaches.Students on the course will experience hands-on social science research, media-rich fusion teaching environments, collaborative design, and engagement with relevant literary texts, building towards the production of a group research presentation and an individual 'social science fiction' demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of the implications of personalisation and surveillance for education in the future.The course is organized as an intensive teaching model. Activities prior to intensive week include 2x scheduled online lectures (0.5hrs) (delivered live and recorded), 2x scheduled synchronous videoconference seminars (1hr), assigned reading, and asynchronous discussion forum. During the intensive week, students will experience 2-days of hybrid on-campus/online teaching:Day One:- Short, live and recorded lecture by course leader introducing key themes and purposes of intensive activities.- Seminar (facilitated on-campus and online) focused on critically examining educational technologies.- Facilitated collaborative research activity, with on-campus and online students organised in small working groups to critically examine an educational technology (groups and topics specified in advance during pre-intensive phase).Day Two:- Joint development of research presentation based on collaborative research project from day one, with all presentations (online and on-campus) recorded and captured for formative assessment and asynchronous peer feedback.- Seminar session to highlight overall issues arising from technologies of personalisation and surveillance, with collaborative development of alternative proposals and designs.- Lecture and creative workshop on writing research-based 'social science fiction', leading to post-intensive individual activity.Post-intensive activities include scheduled 1x seminar (1hr), group task, independent study, creative textual production of individual social science fiction texts, asynchronous online discussion, and peer feedback.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed. There will, however, be options to control whether or not your video and audio are enabled.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.",

The course aims to provide students with the knowledge and confidence to critically evaluate and potentially start an ethical EdTech venture.Outline of Syllabus:The course is broken into four sections. The first is an intro to the history, context, and theories of Educational Technology, followed by an introduction to Entrepreneurship. The second focuses on the challenges of identifying customer needs. The third examines some of the key complexities/challenges, in particular the use of learner data and the diverse needs of multilevel stakeholders. The fourth and final section looks at the steps of building an ethical EdTech venture (in particular, data-driven entrepreneurship) and introduces the assessment by considering a key step of raising early finance.Each section will involve an EdTech Case example involving hands-on experience and/or input from an invited/recorded EdTech entrepreneur.Student Learning Experience :Students will begin by drawing on their own prior experience as well as class materials to identify an unmet need facing learners, parents, and other potential customers. From this they will come up with a solution which they will develop into a prototype.Synchronous classroom discussions and workshops will help students understand how to identify entrepreneurial opportunities and gather data to validate business ideas. These discussions will also explore critical areas specific to the EdTech market, such as the morality of education as a business and the ethics of gathering and storing learners' data.The sessions will provide an emotive experience by moving between intense critical debate to more playful hands-on experiences to help ground discussions.The assessment will have students working in small groups to develop crowdfunding pitches for their ideas (50%), which involve using different media and rhetorical techniques to both demonstrate their knowledge of the market and to convince investors and users about the importance of the product.

    "course_description": "Sustainable AI considers the environmental impact of artificial intelligence and other data-intensive technologies and emphasizes policies and practices to make AI more sustainable now and in the future. Many see AI technologies as a key to future discoveries in clean, renewable energy, agricultural resilience, climate forecasting and harm mitigation. Others note that AI's growing carbon footprint and escalating impacts on the supply of water and rare earth minerals are unsustainable, as are many of the social and economic practices associated with the technology.Through in-class exercises that develop skills of ethical assessment and deliberation, expert lectures from across the relevant disciplines, and contemporary course materials, students will learn to engage and shape these debates, and to lead more effectively with a variety of stakeholders on ethical interventions and policies to align AI with environmental health and sustainability. This course will be of interest to students concerned with climate justice, technology, and shaping a more sustainable future.Topics focus on the theory and application of environmental ethics in the domain of artificial intelligence and other data-intensive technologies. Along with ethical background and an introduction to sustainability concepts, topics the course covers might include: greenwashing AI; eco-exploitation of AI resources; metrics of sustainability in AI; AI's potential for environmentally beneficial uses, policy and laws for sustainable AI; the carbon cost of 'innovation', climate justice in AI technology; climate fairness in AI use; and data minimization as a conservationist strategy, among others.Learning in an innovative hybrid and intensive mode that brings together online and in-person students, you will work together in collaborative groups to practice deliberating with others about the environmental impact (both positive and negative) of data-driven technologies and how to align technology with climate ethics to safeguard justice and flourishing for humans and planet alike.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together.

    "course_description": "This course introduces the fundamentals of data ethics as the building blocks of a mature data philosophy. By examining contemporary data practices in their historical, moral and political contexts, students identify how values in data practice shape our past, present and futures, while developing through collaborative activities six critical data skills required for responsible and ethical data practice. These skills are anchored by theoretical and conceptual tools distributed across the course with respect to the following themes:1) The historical and formative conditions (material/social/political) of contemporary data practices.2) Moral theories, relations, principles and values used to co-shape, govern and contest contemporary data practices.3) Political institutions, structures and dynamics of power and justice embedded in contemporary data practices.4) Emerging challenges and norms of ethical data practice.5) Data ethics as a collaborative social project of futures-building.Students will experience a hybrid learning environment taught according to a 'flipped classroom' model centered on critical discourse and collaboration. Each course session will begin with critical, open discussion with instructors of the weekly course reading. Students will submit 2-3 critical reading questions in advance, a selection of which will be shared and discussed in the live classroom session.This will be followed by discussion of the relevance of the reading to a concrete data scenario or case study that embodies a real-world ethical data challenge or problem of vital importance for the shaping of just and sustainable futures. . These scenarios will have been explored by students over the course of the previous two weeks, in asynchronous and multidisciplinary online learning groups. These online learning groups will receive guidance on how to apply one of the six critical data skills [ethical reflection, analysis, deliberation, evaluation, contestation and decision-making] to each teaching week's scenario. Each group's collaboration will be captured in a chat transcript for the scenario exercise that will then serve as data for collective analysis and reflection in the following lecture.Each lecture will end with a whole-class discussion and reflection on the collaboration experience, with course organisers eliciting students' meta-attention to how these skills can be deployed to work with data responsibly and sustainably in any domain.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together.

    "course_description": "This course introduces the fundamentals of data ethics as the building blocks of a mature data philosophy. By examining contemporary data practices in their historical, moral and political contexts, students identify how values in data practice shape our past, present and futures, while developing through collaborative activities six critical data skills required for responsible and ethical data practice. These skills are anchored by theoretical and conceptual tools distributed across the 5 weeks with respect to the following themes:1) The historical and formative conditions (material/social/political) of contemporary data practices.2) Moral theories, relations, principles and values used to co-shape, govern and contest contemporary data practices.3) Political institutions, structures and dynamics of power and justice embedded in contemporary data practices.4) Emerging challenges and norms of ethical data practice.5) Data ethics as a collaborative social project of futures-building.Students will experience a hybrid learning environment taught according to a 'flipped classroom' model centered on critical discourse and collaboration. Each course session will begin with critical, open discussion with instructors of the weekly course reading. Students will submit 2-3 critical reading questions in advance, a selection of which will be shared and discussed in the live classroom session.This will be followed by discussion of the relevance of the reading to a concrete data scenario or case study that embodies a real-world ethical data challenge or problem of vital importance for the shaping of just and sustainable futures. These scenarios will have been explored by students over the course of the previous two weeks, in asynchronous and multidisciplinary online learning groups. These online learning groups will receive guidance on how to apply one of the six critical data skills [ethical reflection, analysis, deliberation, evaluation, contestation and decision-making] to each teaching week's scenario. Each group's collaboration will be captured in a chat transcript for the scenario exercise that will then serve as data for collective analysis and reflection in the following lecture.Each lecture will end with a whole-class discussion and reflection on the collaboration experience, with course organisers eliciting students' meta-attention to how these skills can be deployed to work with data responsibly and sustainably in any domain.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed.

The course will cover the core concepts of a circular economy: definitions, philosophy, principles, history and future opportunities.",
    "course_description": "The circular economy is a systems solution framework that tackles global challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, waste, and pollution. It is a framework that invites businesses, industries, cities, and countries to transform their approach to the use of resources and materials and build a framework that is restorative and regenerative by design. The ultimate goal of CE is to shift away from over-consumption towards a greater recognition of the need for responsible use of natural and technical resources. Both applied and theoretical approaches to the topic will be discussed. This course will give you a foundation for addressing the climate crisis and resource management from a perspective that can help businesses, communities, and governments to:- Finding new ways to reduce global demand on natural resources.- Maximise resource productivity.- Keep materials, components and products circulating for as long as possible while enhancing or maintaining value.You will be introduced to CE applications from micro (individual products or businesses) to macro (city or country) levels, and given an overview of circular business models (which will be explored more in-depth in core course Circular Economy and Business). The topic will be examined from multiple perspectives including the technologies, materials, policies, behaviours, global practices and theories involved in creating a circular economy, and then linked to the issues of the climate crisis. The lecture materials, reading/listening materials, discussions will be grouped around these key topics:- Foundations of a circular economy: the history, theories, context, and principles behind the concept.- Introduction to circular business models.- Policies & society: a look at how government policies and societal impacts of consumption can be transformed.- Exploring notions of 'value' and how this is represented by individuals, communities, societies and economies.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together.

    "summary": "*Programme Core Course: Circular Economy (MSc/PGD/PGC)*Please Note:This course is only available to students enrolled on the Circular Economy (MSc/PGD/PGC) degree.This course introduces the topic of circular economy (CE) by establishing a set of principles which embody the distinctive vision and approach of CE and how it differentiates from the current 'take-make-dispose' economic and business models. The course will cover the core concepts of a circular economy: definitions, philosophy, principles, history and future opportunities.",
    "course_description": "The circular economy is a systems solution framework that tackles global challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, waste, and pollution. It is a framework that invites businesses, industries, cities, and countries to transform their approach to the use of resources and materials and build a framework that is restorative and regenerative by design. The ultimate goal of CE is to shift away from over-consumption towards a greater recognition of the need for responsible use of natural and technical resources. Both applied and theoretical approaches to the topic will be discussed. This course will give you a foundation for addressing the climate crisis and resource management from a perspective that can help businesses, communities, and governments to:- Finding new ways to reduce global demand on natural resources.- Maximise resource productivity.- Keep materials, components and products circulating for as long as possible while enhancing or maintaining value.You will be introduced to CE applications from micro (individual products or businesses) to macro (city or country) levels, and given an overview of circular business models (which will be explored more in-depth in core course Circular Economy and Business). The topic will be examined from multiple perspectives including the technologies, materials, policies, behaviours, global practices and theories involved in creating a circular economy, and then linked to the issues of the climate crisis. The lecture materials, reading/listening materials, discussions will be grouped around these key topics:- Foundations of a circular economy: the history, theories, context, and principles behind the concept.- Introduction to circular business models.- Policies & society: a look at how government policies and societal impacts of consumption can be transformed.- Exploring notions of 'value' and how this is represented by individuals, communities, societies and economies.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed. There will, however, be options to control whether or not your video and audio are enabled.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device.

Students will be encouraged to focus on food systems using a systems approach that connects individual food practices with impacts on environmental sustainability, human nutrition, and animal welfare.",
    "course_description": "This course will introduce students to the vital importance of food systems to a sustainable and habitable planet. Food systems represent complex networks linking natural resource systems with socioeconomic systems that drive supply and demand.In this course, students will examine key stages of the food system: production, aggregation, processing, distribution, consumption, and waste. We will critically reflect on the challenges of provisioning a growing population and their consumption demands, and the impacts of agricultural practices on the environment. A systems perspective is adopted to explore the multiple connections between activities of food production, processing, distribution and consumption, and the biophysical and socio-economic drivers of change. Throughout the course students will be encouraged to focus on themselves as actors within the food system and how their consumption practices are shape and are shaped by the wider food system. A range of geographical and culture contexts will be explored to identify challenges and opportunities for transformation of food system sustainability and health.Students will learn through a combination of pre-recorded online lectures and synchronous (online/in-person) lectures and workshops. Pre-intensive content will include a combination of recorded lectures and videos, reading, discussions, and creative activities to encourage critical reflection on the complex connections between food networks and the biophysical and socioeconomic drivers of change. Students will engage in reflective activities and roleplay during the pre-intensive, intensive and post-intensive to explore the multiple actors and values associated with food systems.

In this final project you will be able to contribute to this agenda by applying your learning in depth to a domain, issue or concern which drives you. Your project can be in an area you wish to interrogate because of your own personal or professional interests. It might also be defined by your employer, be sponsored by one of our EFI industry, government or community partners, or aligned to one of the EFI research programmes. You can submit your final project report as a written piece of work, or combined with other forms as appropriate - video, visualisation, digital artefact, performance, code. It is your chance to apply an interdisciplinary perspective and a methodologically robust approach to an issue you care about.",
    "course_description": "The final project will be relevant to the programme on which you are enrolled, and will address a particular challenge area which may have an organisational, community, cultural, societal or planetary scope. It will take an interdisciplinary approach both methodologically and conceptually, drawing on the taught elements of the programme to interrogate a particular issue in depth.In line with the EFI focus on data skills, data ethics and creative, critical enquiry, the final project will engage with the idea of 'data' in whichever way is most appropriate - for example, creating and using datasets, crafting data visualisations or artefacts, or exploring the epistemological, social, creative, critical and ethical dimensions of a 'datafied' world. Projects will adopt a wide definition of what constitutes 'data' - including both numerical and qualitative - in line with the multiple epistemologies and disciplinary perspectives circulating through the portfolio.You will provisionally define your project early on in your time at EFI, and - via the 'Knowledge Integration and Project Planning' 20 credit course - will develop and refine your project idea in an iterative way over the course of your studies. In this way you will be able to apply the deep intellectual insights and key skills you need both to conduct a sustained piece of enquiry, and to develop as a confident citizen of the world.The student learning experience in relation to the project will in large part be integrated with the work you do through the 'Knowledge Integration and Project Planning' course, which will include peer feedback, supervisor input and sustained reflection. In addition, you will have access to the broader support contexts of the Edinburgh Futures Institute - its event and seminar programmes (both online and offline), its research programmes and its external partnerships.During the 'Knowledge Integration and Project Planning' course, supervision will take place on both a group and an individual basis (three group meetings and one individual meeting). Once you start the Futures Project, supervision will take place on an individual basis through two individual meetings. Regular group supervision meetings during the 'Knowledge Integration and Project Planning' stage will enable you to connect with others on their programmes who are conducting work in aligned areas, supporting you to build networks of peer support. Individual supervision will be provided to give direct and focused support at key points in the project process, specifically in relation to the project plan and the early drafting of the final project report.You will be given the opportunity to present your projects in multiple forms, relevant to the future-facing and interdisciplinary focus of your programme. These might include conventional written dissertations, or creative and multimodal outputs as appropriate to your programme - you will be encouraged to push at the boundaries of representation of academic knowledge, and to take a bold and context-specific approach to the production of the final report.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities.Students should be aware that:- Classrooms used in this course will have additional technology in place: students might not be able to sit in areas away from microphones or outside the field of view of all cameras.- Unless the lecturer or tutor indicates otherwise you should assume the session is being recorded.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.",

In this way you will be able to apply the deep intellectual insights and key skills you need both to conduct a sustained piece of enquiry, and to develop as a confident citizen of the world.The student learning experience in relation to the project will in large part be integrated with the work you do through the 'Knowledge Integration and Project Planning' course, which will include peer feedback, supervisor input and sustained reflection. In addition, you will have access to the broader support contexts of the Edinburgh Futures Institute - its event and seminar programmes (both online and offline), its research programmes and its external partnerships.During the 'Knowledge Integration and Project Planning' course, supervision will take place on both a group and an individual basis (three group meetings and one individual meeting). Once you start the Futures Project, supervision will take place on an individual basis through two individual meetings. Regular group supervision meetings during the 'Knowledge Integration and Project Planning' stage will enable you to connect with others on their programmes who are conducting work in aligned areas, supporting you to build networks of peer support. Individual supervision will be provided to give direct and focused support at key points in the project process, specifically in relation to the project plan and the early drafting of the final project report.You will be given the opportunity to present your projects in multiple forms, relevant to the future-facing and interdisciplinary focus of your programme. These might include conventional written dissertations, or creative and multimodal outputs as appropriate to your programme - you will be encouraged to push at the boundaries of representation of academic knowledge, and to take a bold and context-specific approach to the production of the final report.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities.Students should be aware that:- Classrooms used in this course will have additional technology in place: students might not be able to sit in areas away from microphones or outside the field of view of all cameras.- Unless the lecturer or tutor indicates otherwise you should assume the session is being recorded.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.",

Regular group supervision meetings during the 'Knowledge Integration and Project Planning' stage will enable you to connect with others on their programmes who are conducting work in aligned areas, supporting you to build networks of peer support. Individual supervision will be provided to give direct and focused support at key points in the project process, specifically in relation to the project plan and the early drafting of the final project report.You will be given the opportunity to present your projects in multiple forms, relevant to the future-facing and interdisciplinary focus of your programme. These might include conventional written dissertations, or creative and multimodal outputs as appropriate to your programme - you will be encouraged to push at the boundaries of representation of academic knowledge, and to take a bold and context-specific approach to the production of the final report.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities.Students should be aware that:- Classrooms used in this course will have additional technology in place: students might not be able to sit in areas away from microphones or outside the field of view of all cameras.- Unless the lecturer or tutor indicates otherwise you should assume the session is being recorded.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device.

It will take an interdisciplinary approach both methodologically and conceptually, drawing on the taught elements of the programme to interrogate a particular issue in depth.In line with the EFI focus on data skills, data ethics and creative, critical enquiry, the final project will engage with the idea of 'data' in whichever way is most appropriate - for example, creating and using datasets, crafting data visualisations or artefacts, or exploring the epistemological, social, creative, critical and ethical dimensions of a 'datafied' world. Projects will adopt a wide definition of what constitutes 'data' - including both numerical and qualitative - in line with the multiple epistemologies and disciplinary perspectives circulating through the portfolio.You will provisionally define your project early on in your time at EFI, and - via the 'Knowledge Integration and Project Planning' 20 credit course - will develop and refine your project idea in an iterative way over the course of your studies. In this way you will be able to apply the deep intellectual insights and key skills you need both to conduct a sustained piece of enquiry, and to develop as a confident citizen of the world.The student learning experience in relation to the project will in large part be integrated with the work you do through the 'Knowledge Integration and Project Planning' course, which will include peer feedback, supervisor input and sustained reflection. In addition, you will have access to the broader support contexts of the Edinburgh Futures Institute - its event and seminar programmes (both online and offline), its research programmes and its external partnerships.During the 'Knowledge Integration and Project Planning' course, supervision will take place on both a group and an individual basis (three group meetings and one individual meeting). Once you start the Futures Project, supervision will take place on an individual basis through two individual meetings. Regular group supervision meetings during the 'Knowledge Integration and Project Planning' stage will enable you to connect with others on their programmes who are conducting work in aligned areas, supporting you to build networks of peer support. Individual supervision will be provided to give direct and focused support at key points in the project process, specifically in relation to the project plan and the early drafting of the final project report.You will be given the opportunity to present your projects in multiple forms, relevant to the future-facing and interdisciplinary focus of your programme. These might include conventional written dissertations, or creative and multimodal outputs as appropriate to your programme - you will be encouraged to push at the boundaries of representation of academic knowledge, and to take a bold and context-specific approach to the production of the final report.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together.

    "course_description": "The final project will be relevant to the programme on which you are enrolled, and will address a particular challenge area which may have an organisational, community, cultural, societal or planetary scope. It will take an interdisciplinary approach both methodologically and conceptually, drawing on the taught elements of the programme to interrogate a particular issue in depth.In line with the EFI focus on data skills, data ethics and creative, critical enquiry, the final project will engage with the idea of 'data' in whichever way is most appropriate - for example, creating and using datasets, crafting data visualisations or artefacts, or exploring the epistemological, social, creative, critical and ethical dimensions of a 'datafied' world. Projects will adopt a wide definition of what constitutes 'data' - including both numerical and qualitative - in line with the multiple epistemologies and disciplinary perspectives circulating through the portfolio.You will provisionally define your project early on in your time at EFI, and - via the 'Knowledge Integration and Project Planning' 20 credit course - will develop and refine your project idea in an iterative way over the course of your studies. In this way you will be able to apply the deep intellectual insights and key skills you need both to conduct a sustained piece of enquiry, and to develop as a confident citizen of the world.The student learning experience in relation to the project will in large part be integrated with the work you do through the 'Knowledge Integration and Project Planning' course, which will include peer feedback, supervisor input and sustained reflection. In addition, you will have access to the broader support contexts of the Edinburgh Futures Institute - its event and seminar programmes (both online and offline), its research programmes and its external partnerships.During the 'Knowledge Integration and Project Planning' course, supervision will take place on both a group and an individual basis (three group meetings and one individual meeting). Once you start the Futures Project, supervision will take place on an individual basis through two individual meetings. Regular group supervision meetings during the 'Knowledge Integration and Project Planning' stage will enable you to connect with others on their programmes who are conducting work in aligned areas, supporting you to build networks of peer support. Individual supervision will be provided to give direct and focused support at key points in the project process, specifically in relation to the project plan and the early drafting of the final project report.You will be given the opportunity to present your projects in multiple forms, relevant to the future-facing and interdisciplinary focus of your programme. These might include conventional written dissertations, or creative and multimodal outputs as appropriate to your programme - you will be encouraged to push at the boundaries of representation of academic knowledge, and to take a bold and context-specific approach to the production of the final report.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed. There will, however, be options to control whether or not your video and audio are enabled.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device.

It will take an interdisciplinary approach both methodologically and conceptually, drawing on the taught elements of the programme to interrogate a particular issue in depth.In line with the EFI focus on data skills, data ethics and creative, critical enquiry, the final project will engage with the idea of 'data' in whichever way is most appropriate - for example, creating and using datasets, crafting data visualisations or artefacts, or exploring the epistemological, social, creative, critical and ethical dimensions of a 'datafied' world. Projects will adopt a wide definition of what constitutes 'data' - including both numerical and qualitative - in line with the multiple epistemologies and disciplinary perspectives circulating through the portfolio.You will provisionally define your project early on in your time at EFI, and - via the 'Knowledge Integration and Project Planning' 20 credit course - will develop and refine your project idea in an iterative way over the course of your studies. In this way you will be able to apply the deep intellectual insights and key skills you need both to conduct a sustained piece of enquiry, and to develop as a confident citizen of the world.The student learning experience in relation to the project will in large part be integrated with the work you do through the 'Knowledge Integration and Project Planning' course, which will include peer feedback, supervisor input and sustained reflection.

Regular group supervision meetings during the 'Knowledge Integration and Project Planning' stage will enable you to connect with others on their programmes who are conducting work in aligned areas, supporting you to build networks of peer support. Individual supervision will be provided to give direct and focused support at key points in the project process, specifically in relation to the project plan and the early drafting of the final project report.You will be given the opportunity to present your projects in multiple forms, relevant to the future-facing and interdisciplinary focus of your programme.

    "course_description": "The course aims to provide theoretical and practical tools to connect historical narratives and games, and to produce creative outputs from that, by introducing students to the challenges of engaging with history through games.The course starts with a pre-intensive section comprising a 1-hour online introductory meeting, as well as preliminary readings and videos relevant to the course. They will prepare the ground for the course by highlighting the often-unexpected complexity of defining what a game is, and how games have engaged with historical narratives. This also serves to introduce students to the debates on the limitations and opportunities of the various formats, their nature, practices and uses (including motivations and interpretations).The first part of the intensive period focuses in depth on different genres of games and their specific characteristics in sessions that comprise the participation of scholars and practicing game designers. This will take the form of three two-hour seminars, each devoted to a different genre.The second part of the intensive period moves to practice, with a series of playtests of existing games, which allow comparing this experience with the theory discussed in the first part of the course. Once again, playtests cover different genres, as suggested by scholars and game designers of the course.The outputs of the course reflect its dual nature. They comprise a collaborative game design project, which is developed during the post intensive section of the course. Assessment will be based on an essay in which the students will reflect on their participation in the game design project, and how it related to the theoretical and practical discussions of the pre-intensive and intensive periods.Students will be able to showcase, share or distribute their game design outputs through the activities and online platform (including online stores) of the University of Edinburgh History and Games Lab.The University History and Games Lab also offers a series of complementary relevant activities in which students on this course can take part, including seminars, podcast, playtests, and participation in game jams and game conventions, in collaboration with companies and game designers.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together.

Assessment will be based on an essay in which the students will reflect on their participation in the game design project, and how it related to the theoretical and practical discussions of the pre-intensive and intensive periods.Students will be able to showcase, share or distribute their game design outputs through the activities and online platform (including online stores) of the University of Edinburgh History and Games Lab.The University History and Games Lab also offers a series of complementary relevant activities in which students on this course can take part, including seminars, podcast, playtests, and participation in game jams and game conventions, in collaboration with companies and game designers.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed. There will, however, be options to control whether or not your video and audio are enabled.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.",

At the time of the data deluge, and an increasingly interconnected web, new ways are emerging to 'use' the past to express identities and create social and political change. This change can contribute to the creation of either inclusive or exclusive societies, by fostering respectful or antagonistic ideas of 'others'. In this course, students will explore the data practices, contexts and outcomes underpinned by digitally enabled activism.The course will start with an introduction to the key concept of heritage data activism, drawing on notions of heritage, heritage-based activism, data activism and data practices. Thereafter, it will consider processes and outcomes of digitally enabled social and political activism. Students will learn how museums, archives, heritage places and grassroots communities can activate digital repairs of social fabrics through practices of critical web collecting, digital curation and digital cultural engagement. They will also be introduced to divisive data practices of activism that use the past to support the antagonization of outgroups, whether through hate speech, discrimination or the support of violent extremism. Such uses of the past foster divisiveness towards others based on religion, race, political identity, culture or origin. Finally, the course will examine the features relating to content and context - including the role of heritage 'experts' - that lead to the success of certain forms of heritage-based activism online.Students will learn through a combination of: mini lectures followed by group discussion; individual reading; supervised group activities; individual research and knowledge exchange as well as creative communication of research findings. Students will have the opportunity to reflect on case studies of their choice in the pre-intensive, and to choose from a range of given case studies for supervised group activities during the intensive.

Students will engage with the complex challenge of managing heritage environments for present and future generations and the role heritage can play in climate change adaptation and sustainable development.",
    "course_description": "This course will examine the range of climate change impacts on tangible and intangible cultural heritage in the contemporary world. Cultural heritage includes a wide body of cultural assets that hold a value for their memorialisation of the past, significance to people and society today, and perceived importance to future generations. Decisions about what is of value to current and future generations is therefore as much a political and economic judgement on what to prioritize as a question of historical and local importance. Students on this course will critically examine how heritage is prioritised, for whom, and who makes decisions about the management of risk to heritage environments - especially climate risk. Central to such questions is how heritage is defined and what active role heritage can play in adaptation to climate change.The course will begin with an introduction to cultural heritage protection in international policy on the conservation of heritage assets. This will include a short history of international heritage protection since 1945, the 'heritage boom' following the World Heritage Convention, and the crisis phase of 'late-modern' cultural heritage, as subject to environmental, social, political and economic concern. Building on this historical context, students will engage with a range of climate change impacts on cultural heritage objects, sites, landscapes and practices in the developed and developing world. They will also engage with a range of models, indexes and frameworks used to assess climate change impacts on cultural heritage sites, and examine how political, economic and social factors produce - often contested - ideas about how to manage the future of our past. Students will explore the complex challenges associated with cultural heritage protection in a range of geographical contexts, and the opportunities that heritage perspectives could offer for climate change adaptation. In this context we will also problematize the political and colonial implications of 'technical' terminology such as 'endangered site' and 'safeguarding'.Students will learn through a combination of pre-recorded online lectures, synchronous (online/in-person) lectures and workshops, self-guided field exercises and walk-along seminars. Pre-intensive content will include a combination of recorded lectures and videos, reading, discussions, and creative activities to encourage critical reflection on values associated with cultural heritage and the social construction of risk. A range of case studies will be covered in walk-along seminars, self-guided field trips, and lectures during the intensive and post-intensive period. Lectures will be delivered by academic and professional experts.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities.Students should be aware that:- Classrooms used in this course will have additional technology in place: students might not be able to sit in areas away from microphones or outside the field of view of all cameras.- Unless the lecturer or tutor indicates otherwise you should assume the session is being recorded.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device.

Through challenge-led approaches, you gain knowledge of cutting-edge work that is transforming how we study, preserve, and utilise the past to design strategies and find solutions for a more sustainable future.You will acquire a critical understanding of how heritage research and practice can act as enablers and drivers of sustainable development, and respond to the critical challenges society faces. On completion, you will be able to evaluate initiatives that leverage heritage assets (sites, traditions, collections, monuments, etc.) and values to achieve economic, environmental, and social development sustainably. You will be able to apply relevant concepts and methods practically, to address some of the World's most pressing and complex issues - e.g., climate change, poverty alleviation or equitable societies - from a heritage perspective.",

The course will introduce the evolution of the debates that relate culture, including heritage, to sustainable development as a key enabler to achieve this. It will present the current International Agreed Development Goals (i.e. United Nations Agenda 2030, The United Nations Ocean Decade for Sustainable Development, etc.) and the different strategies developed at international, national and local level to utilise natural and cultural heritage, tangible and intangible, to achieve better livelihoods and well-being.Students will learn about the different strategies approved by a myriad of stakeholders at international, national or local levels (i.e. within UNESCO Convention's strategies, Preparedness and Response strategies, etc.) to make heritage part of the solution to today's main challenges. The course will present evidence-based case studies from specific research projects that aim to harness economic, social, and environmental sustainable development through heritage preservation (i.e. The Rising from the Depths Network). The course will also cover the following topics: Heritage, Local Needs and Global Challenges; Heritage and the UN Sustainable Development Goals; Heritage and the Sustainability of the Oceans.Teaching will combine:1) Mini-lectures and discussions of current and emerging issues, theoretical approaches, and results from challenged-led projects.2) Individual and group-based analysis of specific studies from different regions and focusing on various challenges (e.g., poverty, economic crisis, climate change, conflict, economic development, Blue Economy, etc.).Researchers and practitioners working in the field of Heritage and Sustainable Development will be invited to share their experiences with students during the course.

    "summary": "*Programme Core Course: Cultural Heritage Futures (MSc/PGD/PGC)*Please Note:This course is only available to students enrolled on the Cultural Heritage Futures (MSc/PGD/PGC) degree.In this course, you will learn how to draw on heritage to respond to pressing social, economic, and environmental issues. Through challenge-led approaches, you gain knowledge of cutting-edge work that is transforming how we study, preserve, and utilise the past to design strategies and find solutions for a more sustainable future.You will acquire a critical understanding of how heritage research and practice can act as enablers and drivers of sustainable development, and respond to the critical challenges society faces. On completion, you will be able to evaluate initiatives that leverage heritage assets (sites, traditions, collections, monuments, etc.) and values to achieve economic, environmental, and social development sustainably. You will be able to apply relevant concepts and methods practically, to address some of the World's most pressing and complex issues - e.g., climate change, poverty alleviation or equitable societies - from a heritage perspective.",
    "course_description": "This course will introduce the different ways in which heritage can contribute to respond to today's main global challenges, marrying global sustainable development agendas with local realities and needs. The course will introduce the evolution of the debates that relate culture, including heritage, to sustainable development as a key enabler to achieve this. It will present the current International Agreed Development Goals (i.e. United Nations Agenda 2030, The United Nations Ocean Decade for Sustainable Development, etc.) and the different strategies developed at international, national and local level to utilise natural and cultural heritage, tangible and intangible, to achieve better livelihoods and well-being.Students will learn about the different strategies approved by a myriad of stakeholders at international, national or local levels (i.e. within UNESCO Convention's strategies, Preparedness and Response strategies, etc.) to make heritage part of the solution to today's main challenges. The course will present evidence-based case studies from specific research projects that aim to harness economic, social, and environmental sustainable development through heritage preservation (i.e. The Rising from the Depths Network). The course will also cover the following topics: Heritage, Local Needs and Global Challenges; Heritage and the UN Sustainable Development Goals; Heritage and the Sustainability of the Oceans.Teaching will combine:1) Mini-lectures and discussions of current and emerging issues, theoretical approaches, and results from challenged-led projects.2) Individual and group-based analysis of specific studies from different regions and focusing on various challenges (e.g., poverty, economic crisis, climate change, conflict, economic development, Blue Economy, etc.).Researchers and practitioners working in the field of Heritage and Sustainable Development will be invited to share their experiences with students during the course. This will also provide an important opportunity to network with key players in the sector and will significantly contribute to students' career development.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed. There will, however, be options to control whether or not your video and audio are enabled.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.",

The course will provide knowledge of fundamental legal principles under UK law, expose students to the application of such rights within the business models of selected creative sectors, explore challenges within the creative industries concerning protection of intangible assets, and enable students to reflect on the role of IP rights in their future career.This course is taught intensively, with the scheduled teaching comprising a two hour, pre-intensive introductory session, followed by two 1-day intensive  sessions, and ending with a post-intensive activity. Students will be provided materials to read, questions to review, and group exercises to prepare for, in advance of the intensive sessions.The course will examine the following key topics over the two intensive sessions:- Generating IP - Legal rules on key Intellectual Property Rights relevant to creative industries- IP audit - Identifying IP assets and ownership- IP exploitation - Legal rules on contractual exploitation, and different routes of exploitation- Business models in creative industries that are primarily based on exploitation of IP- Business models in creative industries that are not based on exploitation of IP- IP related challenges in the creative industriesAfter completion of the intensive sessions, the post-intensive activity will comprise a formative group exercise. In advance of this activity, students will work in teams and prepare a short powerpoint presentation of around 4-5 slides on a practical exercise also provided in advance.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device.

It explores how material practices are contributing to the creation of novel interfaces and embodied human experience with data-driven systems, and critically examines their potential across diverse sectors and scales of human interaction.",
    "course_description": "This course opens up critical discourses between disciplines, providing the student with the essential building blocks to question dominant imaginaries around the material aesthetics and architectures of internets of things. Topics will include implications for interdisciplinary design processes (including how service design might sit within larger dynamic infrastructures), and ethical concerns with human agency, identity and creativity as a result of the perceptual availability and legibility of interfaces, and the choices individuals and communities get to make about their data.Students will be introduced to material practices such as textiles for the creation of custom sensors and displays, along with non-technological ideation platforms available for designing flexible infrastructures of things (such as card decks and gaming-informed applications). Inspired by cutting edge case studies, students will synthesise their learning through the development of an interdisciplinary proposal for a service design concept, accounting for human agency and embodiment and reflecting on the value of diverse disciplines in this fast-growing sector. Whatever their previous experience, all students will emerge able to curate the role of material in future product-service-systems, and to interrogate the design values and human experiences embodied by them.This course is taught over an intensive 2-day block, with some structured activity before and after the intensive.Taught sessions will cover a mix of time spent on:(1) Critical comparison of available Internet of Things (IoT) hardware platforms;(2) Hands-on creation of simple circuits using embroidery techniques and sewable hardware components;(3) A directed survey of relevant case study projects;(4) Small group exploration of lo-fi ideation toolkits for designing IoTs;(5) Developing  IoT and/or service design concepts using selected ideation tools;(6) Creating a video submission.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together.

    "course_description": "This course will be part of the MSc Education Futures programme, but will have relevance to other programmes where students wish to explore the interactional dimension of interdisciplinary collaboration in research, educational and professional environments.This course employs practical, experiential and methods-driven approaches to explore how interdisciplinarity is enacted in various educational, research and professional contexts. Engagement in collaborative group work throughout the course provides students with tools to think critically and reflectively across the boundaries of a range of disciplines, academic and professional contexts and practices, deepening their understanding of differences in theoretical, applied, and practice-based methodologies.Students will explore what interdisciplinary processes look like and how interdisciplinarity is enacted in practice to further develop their knowledge and understanding of interdisciplinary approaches gained from the core courses.  They will learn to analyse interactional patterns in order to understand the dynamics of collaborative group work and identify how these patterns shape our present and future interdisciplinary engagement.The course provides students with a toolkit of knowledge and strategies for recognising and adapting to norms outside their own disciplinary knowledge and approaches, and establishes a foundation for more effective reflection on their own interactional patterns of interdisciplinary collaborative engagement. These are anchored by conceptual, analytical and reflective tools distributed across the 5 weeks and aligned with the following themes:1) The concept of interdisciplinarity: definitions and approaches.2) Emerging challenges and norms of interdisciplinary engagement (focusing primarily but not exclusively on Higher Education).3) Theories, practices and values used to co-shape and contest current interdisciplinary endeavours in both pedagogy and research.4) Analytical tools and approaches for exploring why interaction matters and mapping dynamic patterns in interaction.5) Characteristics and complexities of interdisciplinary interaction and its potential for shaping interdisciplinary futures.The course builds on understandings gained in the shared core 'Interdisciplinary Futures EFI core courses (though attendance on these course is not a pre-requisite) and develops these to explore theories, approaches and practices in research and educational contexts, in order to understand what successful interdisciplinary learning and teaching can look like.

Groups will work together to develop preliminary responses to the brief. Online tools including Miro will be used to support ideation and collaboration.(iii) Presentations back to the class will provide an opportunity for formative feedback in the review of different group responses to the brief. They will then use these plans to inform their development through the post-intensive phase.(iv) A final seminar will close the intensive two days and detail the expectations for the post-intensive period toward the final submission of coursework.Groups will remain connected throughout the post-intensive period which will consist of two elements:(i) Virtual studios will be self-organised by groups to pursue the group assignment, and will be facilitated through the provision of online tools linked to the assessment.(ii) Presentations delivered synchronously onsite and online, will provide an opportunity for groups to present their pitch, and receive formative feedback prior to a final submission. Asynchronous students will be able to contribute pre-recorded content and/or view recordings of the pitch and feedback.The student experience will integrate personal learning objectives within a group / studio environment. It will combine individual study together with structured tutor led workshops, a virtual studio culture, seminars and tutorials, toward the understanding and application of service design methods. It will link the work and personal experiences of the student together with the historical and contemporary discipline of service design and appreciate its application in the creation of inclusive human-centred services.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together.

Groups will work together to develop preliminary responses to the brief. Online tools including Miro will be used to support ideation and collaboration.(iii) Presentations back to the class will provide an opportunity for formative feedback in the review of different group responses to the brief. They will then use these plans to inform their development through the post-intensive phase.(iv) A final seminar will close the intensive two days and detail the expectations for the post-intensive period toward the final submission of coursework.Groups will remain connected throughout the post-intensive period which will consist of two elements:(i) Virtual studios will be self-organised by groups to pursue the group assignment, and will be facilitated through the provision of online tools linked to the assessment.(ii) Presentations delivered synchronously onsite and online, will provide an opportunity for groups to present their pitch, and receive formative feedback prior to a final submission. Asynchronous students will be able to contribute pre-recorded content and/or view recordings of the pitch and feedback.The student experience will integrate personal learning objectives within a group / studio environment. It will combine individual study together with structured tutor led workshops, a virtual studio culture, seminars and tutorials, toward the understanding and application of service design methods. It will link the work and personal experiences of the student together with the historical and contemporary discipline of service design and appreciate its application in the creation of inclusive human-centred services.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed.

It will provide the foundations from which deeper knowledge and understanding of service management and design may be built.The course is comprised on three main elements:1) Pre-Intensive Independent Learning (including a mixture of synchronous and asynchronous content)This will be comprised of the following elements:(i) A pre-recorded lecture introducing the course, and introducing students to key concepts/themes: service/services, the importance of the service sector, the different types of service sectors, the nature of service ecosystems, and the rise of digital/AI and the implications for service delivery;(ii) Readings from selected academic papers/chapters as an introduction to service management theory and pre-recorded interviews with practitioners working in a range of sectors;(iii) An online seminar to engage in a focused discussion of the learning materials and to raise any initial questions about the course;(iv) A discussion board, facilitated by the course tutor will also be used for all students to contribute ideas and questions throughout the duration of the course.2) Intensive Teaching  PeriodThis will comprise of a mixture of seminar content, discussion and group activities.The first day will build on the pre-intensive content to explore different perspectives of service, the models of service production, the concept of 'value added', and the role of service organisations and service users during the service production process. It will focus especially on a 'service logic' approach at the micro level, and the implications for service delivery, design and management. Group activities will take the form of discussions and case study exercises based on the application of a 'service logic' to service delivery and design.During the second day, the complexity of external relationships will be explored through the concept of 'service ecosystems'. Digital transformation and AI in a service setting and the management implications will also be explored in this context . At the end of the two day intensive information will be available regarding the course assignment.3.

You will receive formative feedback on this from your Individual Project Supervisor, who will be assigned in early Semester 2 (for full-time students).Students' reflections will culminate in the articulation of a set of key issues emerging from their thinking over the period of their study, reflecting on the cross-disciplinary and methodological implications of their studies and applying their thinking to a coherent, robust and well-structured plan either for a team project, or for an key issue which they would like to address within the context of the team project.To communicate this issue effectively to others, each student will create a 1500 word reflective summary of their ideas and proposal, and a 500 word pitch either to lead a team project or to contribute a sub-element of a wider project. The pitches will be used to identify team members whose interests align and complement one another for the team-based dissertation. The combined 2000 word document will be submitted as the final assessed element of the course (in early May) and will form the basis of a focused meeting with group supervisors.",

Via this course you will bring together the cross-disciplinary understandings gained from your taught courses, and apply these to the design of your final project.",
    "course_description": "Toward the beginning of your time with EFI, you will define a project idea which you will develop and refine throughout your studies, and which will culminate in the completion of the final 40-credit Futures Project. The Knowledge Integration and Project Planning course provides a framework through which you can develop your project ideas and project plan.You will receive a handbook which will clearly sets out the expectations for this piece of work. It will include the requirement to engage in, and reflect on, how different disciplinary perspectives converge on your project area, how the methods training you may have taken might influence the project plan, accounts of changes in thinking regarding project design and other requirements specific to your individual programme.You will be required to make regular posts across the entire period of your studies, with evidence of active engagement and meaningful, consistent reflection required in order to pass. The handbook will specify the detailed requirements for these posts (for example frequency and format).The primary medium for the course will be a digital environment which supports reflection across time, for example a blog or comparable space in which regular posts can be made, and which supports multiple formats and modes of representation (text, image, video). Programmes will choose the environment which aligns best with their pedagogic ethos, but a blog space will be provided as a baseline for all programmes. This space will be designed to enable peer support and peer commentary on each other's work, with granular permissions allowing you to make posts public or entirely private where preferred. It will be lightly monitored by Teaching Assistants (TAs) in order to help programme teams identify instances where students appear to be struggling. It will be supported by group and individual supervison meetings, each of which integrate with the support plan for the final project.At the end of Semester 1 (in year 1 for full-time students) you will submit a '1000 Word Preliminary Project Title and Proposal', which should be informed by the reflective blogging undertaken throughout your studies. You will receive formative feedback on this from your Individual Project Supervisor, who will be assigned in early Semester 2 (for full-time students).Students' reflections will culminate in a '2000 Word Finalised Project Plan and Title' which pulls together your thinking over your period of study and applies it to a coherent, robust and well-structured plan for the completion of your project work.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed. There will, however, be options to control whether or not your video and audio are enabled.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.",

    "course_description": "Toward the beginning of your time with EFI, you will define a project idea which you will develop and refine throughout your studies, and which will culminate in the completion of the final 40-credit Futures Project. The Knowledge Integration and Project Planning course provides a framework through which you can develop your project ideas and project plan.You will receive a handbook which will clearly sets out the expectations for this piece of work. It will include the requirement to engage in, and reflect on, how different disciplinary perspectives converge on your project area, how the methods training you may have taken might influence the project plan, accounts of changes in thinking regarding project design and other requirements specific to your individual programme.You will be required to make regular posts across the entire period of your studies, with evidence of active engagement and meaningful, consistent reflection required in order to pass. The handbook will specify the detailed requirements for these posts (for example frequency and format).The primary medium for the course will be a digital environment which supports reflection across time, for example a blog or comparable space in which regular posts can be made, and which supports multiple formats and modes of representation (text, image, video). Programmes will choose the environment which aligns best with their pedagogic ethos, but a blog space will be provided as a baseline for all programmes. This space will be designed to enable peer support and peer commentary on each other's work, with granular permissions allowing you to make posts public or entirely private where preferred. It will be lightly monitored by Teaching Assistants (TAs) in order to help programme teams identify instances where students appear to be struggling. It will be supported by group and individual supervison meetings, each of which integrate with the support plan for the final project.At the end of Semester 1 (in year 1 for full-time students) you will submit a '1000 Word Preliminary Project Title and Proposal', which should be informed by the reflective blogging undertaken throughout your studies. You will receive formative feedback on this from your Individual Project Supervisor, who will be assigned in early Semester 2 (for full-time students).Students' reflections will culminate in a '2000 Word Finalised Project Plan and Title' which pulls together your thinking over your period of study and applies it to a coherent, robust and well-structured plan for the completion of your project work.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities.Students should be aware that:- Classrooms used in this course will have additional technology in place: students might not be able to sit in areas away from microphones or outside the field of view of all cameras.- Unless the lecturer or tutor indicates otherwise you should assume the session is being recorded.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.",

This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities.Students should be aware that:- Classrooms used in this course will have additional technology in place: students might not be able to sit in areas away from microphones or outside the field of view of all cameras.- Unless the lecturer or tutor indicates otherwise you should assume the session is being recorded.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.",

It provides space for you to reflect on your learning, develop your digital writing and communication skills, and explore research methods appropriate to your project. Via this course you will bring together the cross-disciplinary understandings gained from your taught courses, and apply these to the design of your final project.",
    "course_description": "Toward the beginning of your time with EFI, you will define a project idea which you will develop and refine throughout your studies, and which will culminate in the completion of the final 40-credit Futures Project. The Knowledge Integration and Project Planning course provides a framework through which you can develop your project ideas and project plan.You will receive a handbook which will clearly sets out the expectations for this piece of work. It will include the requirement to engage in, and reflect on, how different disciplinary perspectives converge on your project area, how the methods training you may have taken might influence the project plan, accounts of changes in thinking regarding project design and other requirements specific to your individual programme.You will be required to make regular posts across the entire period of your studies, with evidence of active engagement and meaningful, consistent reflection required in order to pass. The handbook will specify the detailed requirements for these posts (for example frequency and format).The primary medium for the course will be a digital environment which supports reflection across time, for example a blog or comparable space in which regular posts can be made, and which supports multiple formats and modes of representation (text, image, video). Programmes will choose the environment which aligns best with their pedagogic ethos, but a blog space will be provided as a baseline for all programmes. This space will be designed to enable peer support and peer commentary on each other's work, with granular permissions allowing you to make posts public or entirely private where preferred. It will be lightly monitored by Teaching Assistants (TAs) in order to help programme teams identify instances where students appear to be struggling. It will be supported by group and individual supervison meetings, each of which integrate with the support plan for the final project.At the end of Semester 1 (in year 1 for full-time students) you will submit a '1000 Word Preliminary Project Title and Proposal', which should be informed by the reflective blogging undertaken throughout your studies. You will receive formative feedback on this from your Individual Project Supervisor, who will be assigned in early Semester 2 (for full-time students).Students' reflections will culminate in a '2000 Word Finalised Project Plan and Title' which pulls together your thinking over your period of study and applies it to a coherent, robust and well-structured plan for the completion of your project work.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed. There will, however, be options to control whether or not your video and audio are enabled.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.",

All activities can be engaged with by students whether on campus or online.The pre-intensive period (14 hours of student work) will involve viewing introductory videos and doing readings on topics including psychological capital, hope and optimism, and locus of control.

Each of the 196 states parties to the treaty is responsible for implementing children's rights as outlined in the UNCRC, including an obligation to keep pace with interpretations of the Convention as they develop internationally.In order to maximize the versatility of the UNCRC within the UN governance system, students will develop different knowledge and skills in each phase.

    "summary": "This course explores the UNCRC and other international mechanisms as a basis of children's rights to protection and empowerment. The course will focus on developing skills in accessing international resources and translating them into national contexts. It will enable students to examine the relationship between law and policy at national and international levels.",
    "course_description": "This course focuses on the UNCRC, which is a comprehensive treaty that engages civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights with specific focus on how to ensure these rights for all individuals under age 18. The rights contained in the treaty are indivisible and inter-dependent and, as a result, are optimized when implemented as a holistic framework including both legal and non-legal measures. Each of the 196 states parties to the treaty is responsible for implementing children's rights as outlined in the UNCRC, including an obligation to keep pace with interpretations of the Convention as they develop internationally.In order to maximize the versatility of the UNCRC within the UN governance system, students will develop different knowledge and skills in each phase. Cumulatively, this will enable them to usefully read and apply international normative standards in local settings.Students do not need any previous experience in studying law to take this course.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed. There will, however, be options to control whether or not your video and audio are enabled.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device.

The course blends a wider global perspective on this theme with close-up, practical, case studies and a challenge-based learning strategy (e.g. cases of refugees and migrants finding work online, being counted, and navigating the risks of ICT that makes people visible).Students will work collaboratively to understand micro- and macro-level dynamics that shape migrants and refugees' digital lives today, while also being challenged to innovate practical solutions to problems (e.g. platforms that help rather than prevent refugees and migrants find work).",
    "course_description": "This course offers students an intensive deep dive into the digital lives and livelihoods of migrants and refugees, exploring aspects such as digital work and e-commerce, digital data, and ICT-enabled education. The course takes an approach that blends macro-level analysis with challenge-based case studies and collaborative peer work.Phase one is fully online and allows students to work in groups to each find answers to a specific challenge posed by the course conveners. They include themes such as:(1) How have refugees used smartphones to meet specific challenges of their situation?(2) How can refugees work online?(3) What is the data that is used to support but also control refugees?This phase will culminate in each group producing a video presentation on a specific challenge.

    "summary": "This course explores how digitization, data, and Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) impact the lives and livelihoods of migrants and refugees today. The course blends a wider global perspective on this theme with close-up, practical, case studies and a challenge-based learning strategy (e.g. cases of refugees and migrants finding work online, being counted, and navigating the risks of ICT that makes people visible).Students will work collaboratively to understand micro- and macro-level dynamics that shape migrants and refugees' digital lives today, while also being challenged to innovate practical solutions to problems (e.g. platforms that help rather than prevent refugees and migrants find work).",
    "course_description": "This course offers students an intensive deep dive into the digital lives and livelihoods of migrants and refugees, exploring aspects such as digital work and e-commerce, digital data, and ICT-enabled education. The course takes an approach that blends macro-level analysis with challenge-based case studies and collaborative peer work.Phase one is fully online and allows students to work in groups to each find answers to a specific challenge posed by the course conveners. They include themes such as:(1) How have refugees used smartphones to meet specific challenges of their situation?(2) How can refugees work online?(3) What is the data that is used to support but also control refugees?This phase will culminate in each group producing a video presentation on a specific challenge. Phase two is the 'integration and exposure' phase.

    "summary": "Convincing and enrolling others to give opportunities and/or resources is a key aspect of leading, whether as a creative, technical expert, executive or government employee. This course will examine how to make your ideas 'sticky', how to frame and pitch them effectively, and how to use storytelling as a method to get your message heard and remembered. We will examine the accountability of stories, and how they are evaluated and judged by audiences. You will gain practical experience of framing and pitching your ideas to others.",
    "course_description": "This course draws on organisation and management studies and marketing to explore what makes ideas 'sticky', and how to use stories and storytelling as a method to do this. It also makes use of ideas within economic sociology and social movement theory to understand theoretical underpinnings of framing and overflowing which is essential for the enrolment and mobilization of support and resources for ideas. The course is divided into the following three components:1) Pre-intensive independent learning (elements of sticky ideas):The purpose of this component is to provide students with an understanding of what makes ideas stick with audiences (or does not). This will be done through selected pre-readings and short videos overviewing the essentials of 'Made to Stick' framework by Heath and Heath. The students are asked to reflect and apply this framework through the analysis of their own project ideas. In addition, they will read a case study on an iconic brand making use of cultural stories and myths and answer a set of questions. The students will also be expected to familiarise themselves with the assignment brief.2) Two-day intensive learning (theory and practice of framing, storytelling and pitching ideas):This component will focus on the theory and practice of framing and pitching sticky ideas. It will comprise a combination of lectures and guest presentations, discussions, group work and group pitch presentations. During these two intensive days of learning, the students will work in groups to develop and pitch ideas to an assignment brief.Building on the pre-intensive component and pre-tasks, and lecture content introducing the students to theories and techniques of storytelling, pitching and framing delivered by the course organiser and guest speakers on types of pitches and pitching, they will prepare and deliver a mock-up pitch presentation on the second intensive day. The students will receive formative feedback from the course organiser which they can use in their final video pitch presentations and individual coursework in the post-intensive component.3) Post-intensive independent learning (application and critical analysis of a pitched idea):This component will focus on the preparation of the final video pitch presentation and an individual assignment (critical analysis of the pitched idea in an essay format). The students will be supported by the course organiser through an online discussion board, email and synchronous Q&A sessions (delivered multiple times to cover different time zones).Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities.Students should be aware that:- Classrooms used in this course will have additional technology in place: students might not be able to sit in areas away from microphones or outside the field of view of all cameras.- Unless the lecturer or tutor indicates otherwise you should assume the session is being recorded.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device.

GI can be an integral part of regeneration projects, improving air quality, providing shade, offering surfaces for drainage, while also having the potential to provide locally grown food and access to nature for human health and wellbeing. This can lead to social, economic, and ecological renewal.This course begins with critical reflection on the place of GI in urban regeneration and then delves into the detail of a particular place in Edinburgh to give you the opportunity to gain skills to develop local case studies of your own.",

    "summary": "This course will explore the inter-relation of place, people and nature in urban regeneration, using the framework of green infrastructure (GI). GI can be an integral part of regeneration projects, improving air quality, providing shade, offering surfaces for drainage, while also having the potential to provide locally grown food and access to nature for human health and wellbeing. This can lead to social, economic, and ecological renewal.This course begins with critical reflection on the place of GI in urban regeneration and then delves into the detail of a particular place in Edinburgh to give you the opportunity to gain skills to develop local case studies of your own.",
    "course_description": "By taking this course you will become familiar with concepts and principles of Green Infrastructure (GI) and how they relate to other areas of sustainability, particularly its role in regeneration projects.You will have the opportunity to review current methods and approaches to assessing urban GI, which include GIS and other technologies that assist in visualising GI data. Using blog posts to reflect upon readings and methods, you will bring this knowledge together by developing a fieldwork study in Edinburgh, with local community engagement.Remote students will be provided with an immersive experience of the city of Edinburgh through audiovisual recordings and digital/surveying technologies, for instance, while also being able to attend fieldwork sessions virtually. You will learn how to establish remote stakeholders, gaining an understanding of the ethics of working with such engagement.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed. There will, however, be options to control whether or not your video and audio are enabled.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.",

Then, working in groups, they will also explore a dataset related to a challenge theme and work up a data representation as a visualisation, or physicalisation using other construction techniques. Alongside this the groups will document this process and the considerations made in producing their final output.Taught sessions will cover a mix of time spent on:(1) Lectures(2) Code-alongs(3) Group discussion, and group collaboration(4) Supported workshop time focussed on visualisations and other forms of data representationEdinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together.

It will enable students to understand data visualisation theory and practice, while simultaneously inviting them to challenge and extend these concepts throughout the course. Students will examine a range of different methodologies and practices for representing data in a variety of formats including physical and embodied formats.",
    "course_description": "The course will give an overview of key aspects of data representation, from analysis of data to aesthetics, form and ergonomics. Students will be introduced to selected readings on the theory of data representation and be asked to engage with a variety of datasets. From this they will discuss different ways to represent, or potentially misrepresent, data as well as the role of narrative and medium in designing an effective representation.Students will explore these datasets through different visualisation concepts and techniques, supported by notebook-based computer worksheets. Then, working in groups, they will also explore a dataset related to a challenge theme and work up a data representation as a visualisation, or physicalisation using other construction techniques. Alongside this the groups will document this process and the considerations made in producing their final output.Taught sessions will cover a mix of time spent on:(1) Lectures(2) Code-alongs(3) Group discussion, and group collaboration(4) Supported workshop time focussed on visualisations and other forms of data representationEdinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed.

From this grounding, we will look at strategies for working with stories to effect social change and examine case studies where storytelling is used in relation to nature connection and environmental sustainability.We will explore storytelling traditions and tales as core to intangible cultural heritage (ICH), enabling traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) to be maintained and shared, and look critically at how to work respectfully with the ICH of other cultures.  We will also look at creating new stories, particularly for communicating science in engaging ways.The two-day intensive will be run in a workshop format, providing you with hands-on training in crafting and telling stories.  We will explore local place and nature connection through story.  A guest storyteller will join us for half a day, to share stories and insights about working with ICH, storytelling and TEK.  Across the two days, there will be plenty of opportunities to share in small and large group settings.  Our intensive will conclude with a live-streamed storytelling Ceilidh, providing you with an opportunity to tell a story to your peers.  Learning before and after the intensive will be accessed online through readings, videos and short, independent exercises aimed at connecting you through story to the place where you live.  In keeping with the Ceilidh culture, we will also be meeting up online at four 'kitchen table gatherings' for an informal chat about what you are learning during these periods.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together.

It will comprise of a combination of lectures, guest presentations, discussions, and group work.3) Post-intensive independent learning: This component will focus on the preparation of the individual assignment. The students will be supported by the course organiser and a teaching assistant through an online discussion board, email and synchronous Q&A sessions that will potentially be delivered twice if needed to cover multiple time zones.The student experience for all students will combine independent learning with group activities and discussions offline and online to create an active and collaborative learning environment for both synchronous and asynchronous students.

The first day will focus on strategic leadership in service settings , and the second day on organisational culture and service culture.3) Post-Intensive PeriodThis part of the course will focus on preparation of the assignment and is comprised of three elements:(i) Course participants will be provided with additional papers on strategic leadership and organisational and service culture in order to help in the preparation of their assignments;(ii) A post intensive discussion board will enable students to continue to share ideas regarding their reading in the post intensive phase;(iii) There will be an opportunity for formative feedback on students assignment ideas.The student experience for all course participants will combine independent learning with group activities and investigation to facilitate a supportive and active learning environment. This will include independent study, on campus and virtual seminars, and group activities, including problem-based case studies and real-time investigations.

    "course_description": "This course draws on Service Management and Organisational Behaviour theory to explore and understand the interconnections between leadership and organisational culture in service organisations.The course is comprised of three main elements:1) Pre-Intensive Independent LearningThis will be comprised of the following elements:(i) A pre-recorded lecture, introducing an overview of the course and introducing students to strategic leadership and culture in a service setting;(ii) Pre-course reading;(iii) Facilitated discussion board for students to contribute ideas regarding the pre-course readings.2) Intensive Teaching PeriodThis will comprise of a mixture of seminar content, discussion and group activities, involving insights from practice through guest speakers or recorded interviews. The first day will focus on strategic leadership in service settings , and the second day on organisational culture and service culture.3) Post-Intensive PeriodThis part of the course will focus on preparation of the assignment and is comprised of three elements:(i) Course participants will be provided with additional papers on strategic leadership and organisational and service culture in order to help in the preparation of their assignments;(ii) A post intensive discussion board will enable students to continue to share ideas regarding their reading in the post intensive phase;(iii) There will be an opportunity for formative feedback on students assignment ideas.The student experience for all course participants will combine independent learning with group activities and investigation to facilitate a supportive and active learning environment. This will include independent study, on campus and virtual seminars, and group activities, including problem-based case studies and real-time investigations. The approach will also support critical reflection of leadership and management approaches and the potential implications for service delivery and organisational sustainability.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed. There will, however, be options to control whether or not your video and audio are enabled.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device.

Students will deconstruct and question opportunities beyond sustainability, to build a more circular, regenerative system in fashion and textiles. This will include exploring systems of care, repair and wellbeing.The course will critically examine the creation of fibre and textiles within the context of its impact on people, place and planet. The course places emphasis on traceability and transparency, community and conversation, and how we determine and place value on the materials we utilise, employ, create, wear, discard and keep.",
    "course_description": "This course encourages critical and creative approaches to more regenerative, circular, and restorative ways of designing and thinking in fashion and textile practices. It offers a place to explore and reimagine a world where textile and fashion value is not only measured by monetary and marketing success.Students will be guided to explore regenerative approaches towards design through:- Analysis of textile and fashion models- Determining how a design ex-novation approach may be employed- Exploring material value through community considerations- Working with textiles through their hands-on deconstruction to reveal hidden clues, patinas and facts about their heritage, life, provenance and possible futures- Working with mending techniques and approached as a mode to explore longevity, inbuilt lifetimes and future aestheticsMaterials, systems and communities play an important role for the future and in how we explore value within the fashion and textiles industries. These industries are hugely exploitative and polluting to our environment. With the climate in crisis, we need new ways to restore and regenerate the future health of both people and planet.Fashion heralds itself as being at the forefront of change but is struggling with the scale and complexity of its systems, models and attitudes towards the climate crisis. How can we unlearn and unstitch, in order to relearn: harnessing ancient wisdoms to create a more circular system that adds value, restoratively and regeneratively.The course introduces the concept of putting nature and community at the forefront of textile design choices. Accepted fashion and textile business models where the focus is on speed and cost, we will deconstruct marketing within this structure, exploring a slower, more hands-on and considered approach to design. Paying attention to product quality, longevity and post-consumer waste. This course will encourage critical and creative approaches to a more regenerative and restorative way of designing and thinking through a sustainable textile practice.Course Delivery Outline:This course places an emphasis on practical learning through creative workshops and reflective discussions. 'Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I may remember. Involve me and I will learn'. (Benjamin Franklin)Student Learning Experience:- Pre-workshop reading listening/watching short pre-recorded lecture giving background context.- Introduction to the course, discussing the basic concept of regenerative systems in relation to materials.- Two-day Intensive sessions with practical activities.- Post-intensive: A reflective learning period to capture ideas, feedback, critique and discussion on questions around regenerative thinking. Students to work in small groups, sharing process, ideas, design thinking, and material understanding collectively via visual community blogs.- Students will work individually on a reflective visual journal/sketchbook to collate a personal investigation.Industry experts and regenerative systems thinkers will add to the course through a series of interviews and discussions, recorded to provide a deeper context, experiences and understanding.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together.

    "summary": "This course offers an opportunity and place to examine a more considered approach to how and what we design through the lens of fashion and textiles. Students will deconstruct and question opportunities beyond sustainability, to build a more circular, regenerative system in fashion and textiles. This will include exploring systems of care, repair and wellbeing.The course will critically examine the creation of fibre and textiles within the context of its impact on people, place and planet. The course places emphasis on traceability and transparency, community and conversation, and how we determine and place value on the materials we utilise, employ, create, wear, discard and keep.",
    "course_description": "This course encourages critical and creative approaches to more regenerative, circular, and restorative ways of designing and thinking in fashion and textile practices. It offers a place to explore and reimagine a world where textile and fashion value is not only measured by monetary and marketing success.Students will be guided to explore regenerative approaches towards design through:- Analysis of textile and fashion models- Determining how a design ex-novation approach may be employed- Exploring material value through community considerations- Working with textiles through their hands-on deconstruction to reveal hidden clues, patinas and facts about their heritage, life, provenance and possible futures- Working with mending techniques and approached as a mode to explore longevity, inbuilt lifetimes and future aestheticsMaterials, systems and communities play an important role for the future and in how we explore value within the fashion and textiles industries. These industries are hugely exploitative and polluting to our environment. With the climate in crisis, we need new ways to restore and regenerate the future health of both people and planet.Fashion heralds itself as being at the forefront of change but is struggling with the scale and complexity of its systems, models and attitudes towards the climate crisis. How can we unlearn and unstitch, in order to relearn: harnessing ancient wisdoms to create a more circular system that adds value, restoratively and regeneratively.The course introduces the concept of putting nature and community at the forefront of textile design choices. Accepted fashion and textile business models where the focus is on speed and cost, we will deconstruct marketing within this structure, exploring a slower, more hands-on and considered approach to design. Paying attention to product quality, longevity and post-consumer waste. This course will encourage critical and creative approaches to a more regenerative and restorative way of designing and thinking through a sustainable textile practice.Course Delivery Outline:This course places an emphasis on practical learning through creative workshops and reflective discussions. 'Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I may remember. Involve me and I will learn'. (Benjamin Franklin)Student Learning Experience:- Pre-workshop reading listening/watching short pre-recorded lecture giving background context.- Introduction to the course, discussing the basic concept of regenerative systems in relation to materials.- Two-day Intensive sessions with practical activities.- Post-intensive: A reflective learning period to capture ideas, feedback, critique and discussion on questions around regenerative thinking. Students to work in small groups, sharing process, ideas, design thinking, and material understanding collectively via visual community blogs.- Students will work individually on a reflective visual journal/sketchbook to collate a personal investigation.Industry experts and regenerative systems thinkers will add to the course through a series of interviews and discussions, recorded to provide a deeper context, experiences and understanding.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed. There will, however, be options to control whether or not your video and audio are enabled.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.",

Students will gain in-depth knowledge of the 'what, why, and who' of transportation systems, and the complex interrelationships between these components, that give rise to outcomes around equality, sustainability, and health. Approaches to understanding, modelling, and assessing transportation systems will be covered, to enable students to identify opportunities and gaps in application to different challenges.

The future of each is dependent on the other...\" (Lyons, 2004).This course will introduce students to current transportation systems, their inter-relationships with society and place, the data and approaches needed to meet increasingly complex transport design challenges, and the future of transportation technologies and scenarios in a climate change world.",
    "course_description": "In this course, students will learn to understand current transportation systems, their interrelationships with society and place, the data and approaches needed to meet increasingly complex challenges, and the future of transportation technologies and scenarios.Going beyond traditional transportation engineering, this course will examine these issues through the interdisciplinary lenses of systems and futures thinking. Students will gain in-depth knowledge of the 'what, why, and who' of transportation systems, and the complex interrelationships between these components, that give rise to outcomes around equality, sustainability, and health. Approaches to understanding, modelling, and assessing transportation systems will be covered, to enable students to identify opportunities and gaps in application to different challenges. Students will learn futures thinking approaches, and explore specific future scenarios (in terms of both technologies and sociotechnical design). Overall, this course will provide concepts and methods that will enable students to characterise and analyse transport & society challenges, both in the present day and in the future.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed. There will, however, be options to control whether or not your video and audio are enabled.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.",

    "course_description": "Our planet's climate is changing due to a range of drivers and forces, predominantly human-made. This change is happening quickly and is one of humanity's greatest challenges. Climate change is already affecting every region across the globe, with human influence on the climate contributing to biodiversity loss, observed changes in weather, extreme events, and overconsumption of the planet's material and natural resources. Climate change is also impacting on human health and human settlements (both urban and rural). To begin to tackle this wicked problem, it is important to first understand the mechanisms which drive it.This course will examine the hazards, vulnerabilities, capacities, and limits of the natural world and human societies in relation to climate change, and the need for both mitigation and adaptation. It will introduce the complexities of implementing mitigation and adaptation solutions to address the climate crisis at a range of scales - from individual businesses and communities to international policy. Students will learn from climate experts and the latest international reports to gain a clearer understanding of climate change. Through case studies and reports, students will also gain a global perspective and discuss the impacts of the climate crisis from the perspectives of gender, race, indigenous communities and class. By the end of the course, students will be able to discuss the intersections of the climate crisis and their chosen programme of study.The course will provide an overview of how the global climate system operates, addressing questions such as:- What are the drivers of climate change?- How do we know climate change is happening?- How do scientists predict possible climate futures?- What societal and environmental impacts are of greatest concerns?- How can information about climate change be communicated to a range of audiences?Throughout the semester students will take part in scheduled in-class and online discussions and activities. These are designed to help students tackle some of the more challenging topics and provide a space to discuss and debate key concepts.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - On-Site Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities.Students should be aware that:- Classrooms used in this course will have additional technology in place: students might not be able to sit in areas away from microphones or outside the field of view of all cameras.- Unless the lecturer or tutor indicates otherwise you should assume the session is being recorded.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device.

    "summary": "Utopia has a long history in scholarship, and recent years have seen it increasingly used as a conceptual and analytic framing for understanding contemporary crises and global challenges.This interdisciplinary course will introduce you to the scholarship of utopia, and support you to apply it to a topic or complex challenge area of your own. It will explore how the concept of utopia has shifted over the centuries, how it might support the analysis of contemporary society, and how it might offer new ways of building hope for the future.",
    "course_description": "The course is part of the MSc Education Futures, but will have relevance to you whatever programme you are studying, if you wish to pursue the application of interdisciplinary scholarship on the theme of utopia.The course will introduce you to the concept of utopia and to utopia as method. It will include a series of 'deep dives' into applications of the term across a variety of disciplines and complex challenge areas. These will vary by year but may include the political science of utopia, utopia as method, utopia in education reform, utopia and AI, the history of utopian thought, climate and utopia, quantified utopias, literary utopia, utopia and creativity, utopia in theology and utopia in architecture.Teaching includes structured online activities including supported reading groups and image-sharing over the two week pre-intensive period. The two-day intensive will consist of short lectures, discussions, creative activities and an 'assignment fair'. There is asynchronous 'drop in' support during the post-intensive period when you are working on your assignment.Through this assignment, you will be supported to apply utopian thought and utopia as method to a challenge area of your own - for example education policy, climate change, global justice or technology acceleration.Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI) - Online Fusion Course Delivery Information:The Edinburgh Futures Institute will teach this course in a way that enables online and on-campus students to study together. This approach (our 'fusion' teaching model) offers students flexible and inclusive ways to study, and the ability to choose whether to be on-campus or online at the level of the individual course. It also opens up ways for diverse groups of students to study together regardless of geographical location. To enable this, the course will use technologies to record and live-stream student and staff participation during their teaching and learning activities. Students should note that their interactions may be recorded and live-streamed. There will, however, be options to control whether or not your video and audio are enabled.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device. Unless otherwise stated activities will be web browser based and as a minimum we recommend a device with a physical keyboard and screen that can access the internet.",

In the two day intensive, students will discuss definitions of VAC, the global burden of VAC, theoretical frameworks around who is at risk of VAC, why they are at risk, and the global burden of VAC.The course will be taught in a hybrid format and students will be examined on a project which covers the skills learned during the course. The pre-intensive VAC course is self-paced and contains pre-recorded lectures/interviews with subject experts, case studies, quizzes and reflective exercises. The 2-day intensive will consist of live/streamed lecture inputs, pre-recorded interviews/short lectures, group discussions, small group projects, content creation, role play simulations and reflective tasks. This will enable students to digest empirical information, appraise the available evidence and develop practice and policy relevant materials with condensed knowledge on violence against children epidemiology.The post-intensive is an individual student project which will take the form of a PowerPoint presentation (that students will record) with accompanying wiki entry. Students will pick one type of VAC and provide an evidence-based overview of the definition, measurement and epidemiology in relation to prevalence, risk and protective factors and associated health outcomes.Students should be aware that:- Classrooms used in this course will have additional technology in place: students might not be able to sit in areas away from microphones or outside the field of view of all cameras.- Unless the lecturer or tutor indicates otherwise you should assume the session is being recorded.As part of your course, you will need access to a personal computing device.

On the one hand, there are techno-dystopian warnings of robots replacing humans at work, and on the other there are promises of reduced work and richer lives in a post-work society.This course critically engages with such visions and develops radical alternatives. Students will develop their own future scenarios for the world of work we want to live in, and will propose principles that should guide such futures.",
    "course_description": "Work defines humankind and shapes societies. However, processes of automation and robotisation are transforming humans' contemporary relationship with work, and are implicated in generating wide-ranging inequalities and polarisation. This trend looks likely to continue. A different world of work is possible, but developing alternatives requires radical thinking, socio-political will, long-term planning, attention to the education system, and most importantly, a 'vision' or set of principles to guide these changes.For systems of education, for example, it is not sufficient to ask what kinds of skill sets are needed by people to be able to participate in the world of work - we also need to ask: what kind of world of work do we want to live in?The course is designed around individual tasks, classroom-based group discussions, brainstorming sessions and workshops for students to develop radical alternatives for work futures.Students will progress through three stages:(1) The Immersion Stage (pre-intensive weeks):Will involve individual and group work (both synchronous and asynchronous). Students will engage with a combination of essential readings, and audio/video commentaries on techno-dystopian and utopian futures of work.(2) The Intensive Stage (two-day workshop):Day 1 will involve three Foundational Lecture Workshops involving lectures and group discussion. These will cover: sociology of work (how work gets done); geography of work (where and why work gets done); technology at work (how work is changing). On Day 2, students will work in teams in a workshop-based format to brainstorm radical ideas around the future of work in three separate sessions: Principles, Vision, and Practice, followed by group presentations.3.\tPost-Intensive/Application Stage:The third phase will be dedicated to investigation and production of the assignment, and drop-in sessions.
