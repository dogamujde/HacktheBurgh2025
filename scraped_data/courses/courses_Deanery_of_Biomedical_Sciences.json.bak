    "summary": "Under the mentorship of a clinician or academic in the department of anaesthesia, critical care and pain medicine, students will conduct a research project during the second semester of the programme.  Supervisors and projects will normally be allocated in advance of the programme starting to allow students the opportunity to apply for scholarships (deadlines are usually at the end of March prior to the start of the programme).  Research projects may be clinical, laboratory, or library based, and can involve the prospective collection of data, analysis and interpretation of previously generated data, or a library based investigative research project addressing a specific question or topic.The faculty will encourage students to strive for excellence during their research project and to use all the skills they have learned and developed during Semester 1 to identify a topic of interest; develop a research question, research protocol, and analysis plan; conduct the research project; write a report to the standard of an academic publication; and present their work to course supervisors and colleagues.",
    "course_description": "Although this course will commence in semester 2, a list of projects and supervisors will be provided to students at the beginning of semester 1 to allow early selection, and then adequate planning of the project. In addition, it is expected that the core module \"Literature Evaluation and Review\", will be carried on a topic related to the chosen project to allow continuity in subject matter over the year.The discipline-specific topics will vary from year to year depending on which projects and supervisors are available. However, it is anticipated that students cover the following general aspects of study design and conduct:1. Identify a topic of interest and draw from the literature review carried out in semester 1 to develop this interest.2. Develop a research question3. Design and research protocol including an analysis plan4. Conduct the research project5. Write a research report to the standard of an academic publication6. Present the work to course supervisors and colleaguesStudents are expected to be self motivated and engaged with the chosen project and work.It is anticipated that students will be engaged in work that is achievable within the 10-week time frame. This may necessitate using data that is already collected, conducting a library based project (e.g. systematic review) or carrying out a supervised lab based project. Clinical projects will be feasible if the relevant approvals have already been organised by the supervisor, or if there is early engagement of the student (at the start of semester 1).",

    "course_description": "Pharmacology is the study of the actions of drugs in the body (pharmacodynamics), and of the quantitative aspects of drug action (pharmacokinetics). The course will provide insight into how drugs produce their effects in the body when treating diseases and alleviating suffering. Most drugs are organic chemicals which interact with the body's physiological and biochemical processes. Consequently, it is necessary to learn a sufficient amount about these processes during the course in order to understand the actions of drugs and how their potencies are quantified. The course will provide opportunities to explore how drugs produce their effects at the systems, cellular and molecular levels. In the course we will consider the targets for the actions of drugs in the body and how the structure and function of receptors and ion channels relates to drug action. We will also investigate intracellular processes within cells and their modification by drugs.Many drugs have chemical structures which are related to the structures of natural substances, found in the body and in other parts of the natural world. Modifications made to these structures can make more specific drugs and/or drugs with longer duration of actions. Some examples of suchchanges in chemical structure will be discussed. Also, the biosynthesis of several natural substances including neurotransmitters and hormones will be outlined. In order to assess the relative potencies of different drugs, it is necessary to have a quantitative measure of drug activity. Opportunities will be provided to gain experience in performing pharmacological-type experiments, gaining familiarity with, and respect for, the use of animal tissues in vitro to analyse drug action, and how quantitative data can be processed into meaningful results and appropriate conclusions.We will evaluate the physical properties of drugs that are important for their effects and develop understanding of the quantification of drug action alongside understanding of the factors controlling the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs by the body. This knowledge will be applied to the clinical usefulness of drugs and the unwanted effects associated with drug usage.",

To give an overview of the strategies and processes by which microorganisms infect and survive within their host.2) To describe how the mammalian immune system detects and kills infecting microorganisms.3) To overview the processes by which infection can result in disease and immune pathology, and the consequences of failing to control infection4) To describe how the immune system can be harnessed for the therapeutic treatment of infections or diseases (E.g. vaccines) and how components of the immune system are used for research and diagnostics.The course will start by giving an overview of infection, and how the immune system is organised (Section 1: Infection and immune System overview). Following this it will detail the characteristics and diversity of micro-organisms, including viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites (Section 2: Diversity and characteristics of microorganisms), and then describe how the immune system exploits these characteristics to identify, respond to, and develop memory towards diverse types of infectious micro-organisms (Section 3: How does the immune system detect infection?). It will then demonstrate how the biology of microorganisms allows them to infect, survive and expand within their host, and the consequences of failing to control infection (Section 4: Microorganism physiology and infection). The course will then discuss the cells of the immune system, and the mechanisms by which they control and kill infectious microbes (Section 5: How does the immune system control infection?). Finally, the course will cover how we are able to harness and use microbes and the immune system for our own goals (Section 6: Harnessing microbes and the immune system). Including environmental and industrial uses of microbes, and how infections and diseases can be controlled through vaccination and immune therapies.The lecture content will be reinforced through a combination of lecture review questions, practical sessions, and tutorials. The tutorials are focussed on developing the skills required to read scientific literature.**Year 2 course - can only be taken by students in their second year of study**",

The course aims to engage students in thinking about the challenges that confront our global society and make them aware of the role of academic research and scholarship in meeting these challenges. Students will be expected to address key themes across discipline boundaries and develop an understanding of the relevance and impact of their own programme discipline in a broader context. Students will develop and test a range of academic skills on the course by engaging with course materials, researching topics in depth, participation in weekly seminars and working in small groups to produce a collaborative short film on a topic chosen by the group. The individual written work requires the submission of short weekly responses to the seminar topic and a piece of reflective writing. The written work facilitates a focus on both formative and summative feedback as students develop academic tools and skills. There are seven seminars (attendance is compulsory to pass the course) and three of these will be focused on topics chosen by students. Our Changing World encourages a partnership between academic staff and students who become co-creators of the course content and the assessment questions. It really is your course because it is your changing world! This course will appeal to students who already have a strong foundation in the core subjects relevant to their degree programme and who wish to engage with academic research and debate in a broader, interdisciplinary way. Our Changing World is a pass/fail grade-only course.",

Your lecturers are research scientists active in the field with cutting-edge knowledge of the material they deliver. They will share their enthusiasm for understanding biology at a fundamental level.You will gain experience of research and enquiry in the practical sessions, by tackling the assessed problem, by engaging with your tutors and demonstrators, and by reading around the topics in your lectures.You will develop personal and intellectual autonomy that will enhance your capacity for life-long and independent learning through studying for the multiple-choice test based on the self-taught material in the Appendix of this course book, through preparing for tutorials, and through the work involved in successfully addressing question set as part of the assessed problem.We encourage you to develop the communication skills essential for every scientist via working as pairs or groups in practical sessions or tutorials, and through participating in the discussion page on the course Learn site when you undertake the assessed problem.You will also have the opportunity to hone your writing skills when summarising the science in the assessed problem.This course has multiple components, some running in parallel, and you will need to organise and summarise your thoughts and material in a flexible and accessible way thus helping you developing the tools needed to maximise your personal effectiveness.In the practical sessions we will teach you modern experimental methods, the rudiments of experimental design, data recording and analysis and interpretation skills, good laboratory practice and awareness of health and safety; thus equipping you with technical and practical skills that are required by many employers.",
    "special_arrangements": "It is possible, upon request,  for TDC students to avoid being assigned to TDC classes after 13.50 on Weds.Note: it is NOT possible for TDC students to have any commitments between 10.00 and 13.00 on Weds.",
    "additional_class_delivery_information": "Timetabled Online Teaching Sessions:There will be a total of 33 fifty-minute timetabled, \u00c2\u00bfonline teaching sessions\u00c2\u00bf in TDC. These replace the in-person lectures of a traditional university course. Most of these sessions will consist of either pre-recorded lectures that are made available according to the timetable or live-streamed lectures (that will be recorded). The 33 sessions are divided into six \u00c2\u00bflecture blocks\u00c2\u00bf: one block of three sessions, in week 1, and then five two-week blocks of six sessions each. Each block will include at least one \u00c2\u00bflive\u00c2\u00bf session or part-session(s) in which students will be encouraged to interact with the lecturer (and each other) online, in real time, by asking questions or seeking clarifications. The format of a block will vary according to how the lecturer feels it is best to deliver their material. For example, some lecturers have decided to give shorter \u00c2\u00bfmini-lectures\u00c2\u00bf interspersed with engagement activities, while others wished to deliver full-length lectures. The five six-session blocks (weeks 2-11) will each be assessed by a formal \u00c2\u00bfopen book\u00c2\u00bf test or exercise, released at the end of the second week of the block. Your answers to these will be formally assessed and will count towards your course mark.The Assessed Exercise:The Assessed Exercise is a significant constituent of TDC and you must allow plenty of time to complete each Section. You will undertake the Assessed Exercise working on your own or with other TDC students, although you must submit your own answers in your own words. The material needed for the Assessed Exercise will be released in four Sections (numbered 0 to 3) throughout the course and each Section should be completed by you and submitted by you before the appropriate deadline. There will be four timetabled online (and recorded) preview/feedback sessions associated with the Assessed Exercise in which we aim to discuss both the previous Section (work already submitted) and the current Section (work to be submitted). We hope these will be interactive and we will be encouraging questions and comments.Your answers to the questions embedded within the Assessed Exercise Sections 1-3 will be assessed and your mark for each Section will count towards your course mark. The Assessed Exercise Introduction (Section 0) will be accompanied by a peer-marking exercise. After submitting your own answers to the questions in Section 0, you will be allocated scripts submitted by two other students and will grade these anonymously online. You will also be asked to provide anonymous feedback to these students. Subsequently you will reconcile the marks you have awarded with those awarded by another peer marker (this is called double marking).Completion of Section 0 and participation in peer-marking will prepare you for the formally assessed components of the Assessed Exercise (Section 1-3). Peer marking will help you think about questions such as the following:What factors does a marker consider when assessing a script and why are these important?What is it, specifically, that students who receive a top mark for a piece of work do to deserve that high mark?Do I understand why my own answer was assessed in a particular way (whether or not I agree with the assessment)?In short, you will get a sense of what makes a well-received versus a poorly received answer. More important than maximising your marks, you will begin to develop a more rounded perspective of the assessment process and its aims. Being able to assess and provide effective feedback to others is a lifelong skill which will also develop your self-assessment skills.More information will be made available on Learn about this exercise.The Lab Skills Session:We understand that due to the disruptions caused by the pandemic, your practical experience in Year 1 was limited. We have therefore organised additional small-group laboratory skills session in weeks 1-3, which will introduce you to the basics of lab work such as pipetting and the use of a spectrophotometer. For these sessions, you will be divided into 14 groups and each group will spend 60 min in the lab. This will be your opportunity to familiarise yourself with the lab space and core lab skills, and ask any questions you may have before embarking on the more complex laboratory practical exercise described below. Before attending your lab skills session, you should watch the video introducing the session, read through the lab skills protocol (a hard copy will be provided in the lab for you to take away with you) and watch the 3 videos explaining the use of some lab equipment (filmed in the lab), all of which are available on Learn.The Laboratory Practical Exercise:The class will be split into 12 groups so make sure you know which group you are in and when your three-hour session is timetabled (two sessions will run on Wednesdays in each of weeks 4-9). It is essential that you attend and you must sign in. You should write up the experiment according to the structured template to be provided and submit your own work for assessment by the appropriate deadline. Your mark for this work will count towards your course mark. A follow-up session for this practical will be offered in triplicate and will be scheduled to take place as soon as possible after your laboratory session but before your submission deadline.Other Sessions:In addition to the timetabled online teaching, assessed exercise preview/feedback and laboratory-practical review sessions, there are several additional entries in the timetable. Early on in this course you must complete the online Multiple-Choice Test on Biological Chemistry Basics and submit your answers after which we will hold a feedback session to go through model answers. There will be a live online PyMOL session (with tutors available to address queries) that you are very strongly advised to attend as this will help you answer an associated test (that you must complete, but which will not be formally assessed).",

    "course_description": "Mechanisms of Brain Development 3 is a Junior Honours course designed to prepare you for Honours courses in Anatomy and Development, and Physiology, as well as allied courses such as Biomedical Sciences, Neuroscience, Pharmacology. This course will investigate the mechanisms by which the nervous system develops from neural tube formation in early embryogenesis to adulthood. It will examine the genetic regulation of neuronal differentiation including cell proliferation, cell death, cell migration, neurite extension and synaptogenesis. More specifically, it will examine the role of transcription factors and signalling molecules in regulating the formation of the brain areas and cellular identity. We will examine the regulatory mechanisms by which axon tracts and dendrites form including genetic control of axon extension and later activity-dependent processes of target selection. Finally, we will investigate the activity-dependent regulation of gene expression, neural anatomy, physiology and behaviour with special focus on the mechanisms of neuronal plasticity that underlie developmental sensitive periods that culminate in a mature functioning nervous system. Since the main goal of this class is to focus on the mechanisms of nervous system development we will draw on information gleaned from a wide range of animals from invertebrates to mammals focusing on conserved mechanisms throughout evolution.",

    "graduate_attributes_and_skills": "The University has identified six groups of abilities (see headings below) that should be developed as part of the University of Edinburgh training experience, and to enhance you employability as a graduate for the 21st Century. These abilities take your skill-base beyond simply academic knowledge and are enhanced at each stage of your degree. They relate to Behavioural Ecology 3  in a number of specific ways, as outlined below.1) Knowledge and Understanding: Lectures, practicals and data analysis sessions are designed to give you a broad knowledge base in the field of behavioural ecology. This includes a history of the development of the subject, the key theories proposed and a wide range of examples of the classic studies that underlie them \u00c2\u00bfboth how they were done and what they found. This University considers itself to be a research-led Institution and you will be exposed to cutting edge information and ideas being published in the area as you progress through your course. However, you will also develop a sound understanding of how research in the field is conducted, evaluated, analysed, presented and assessed.2) Research and Enquiry: You will be asked to build on your lecture and practical material and research current developments in the field for critical appraisal and analysis. Understanding how to use Web of Knowledge will be one important aspect en route to surveying current and past scientific arguments and the relative strength of support for competing hypotheses.3) Personal and Intellectual Autonomy: By reading and preparing materials for practical sessions, you will learn to synthesise your own views, develop reasoned arguments and further refine your scientific judgement. In addition in this course we encourage self-development through use of self-study exercises designed to prepare you with skills that will come later in your course.  Such skills will enhance your capacity for life-long and independent learning.4) Communication: This is a key attribute of all scientists and it is therefore important that you develop skills to interact constructively with others and convey knowledgeable and balanced scientific views. Our presentation and discussion assessments and feedback play a key role in developing these skills.5) Personal Effectiveness The ability to organise and summarise your thoughts and material in a flexible and accessible way are core features that are required for personal effectiveness.  Planning, time management and reflection are central to this. Of course these features also interlink with your personal and intellectual autonomy. By providing you with a timetable where key submission dates are highlighted, we are encouraging you to develop your effectiveness throughout this course.6) Technical and Practical Skills.In order to continue in a scientific career it is important that you not only understand the conceptual basis of how experiments are designed and carried out but also that you have the practical techniques to do this. Your practical training on this course provides skills in basic data collection methods in the behavioural sciences and how these types of data can then be analysed and conveyed. The skills you develop from your practical sessions, in critical observation, investigation and interpretation, careful recording, quantification and analysis, should serve you well in any future employment.",

The graduate attributes we hope you will develop during the Biotechnology 3 course are indicated below:Research and enquiryThis course aims to increase your understanding of the subject area and also obtain the specific skills as outlined in the \u00c2\u00bflearning outcomes\u00c2\u00bf above. The knowledge obtained, and the development of research and technical skills will be of benefit to you in completion of your degree and beyond. The course will also develop your ability to read and critique scientific papers, and your data analysis and problem solving capabilities through the tutorials and practicals. In-course assessment will enable you to evaluate scientific information and make critical judgements and considered conclusions from your scientific enquiries.Personal and intellectual autonomyWe encourage students to work independently to meet the challenges of the course but also to strengthen your views by discussion and debate with other students. By exploring textbooks and research papers you can not only expand your knowledge of the topics covered in the lectures but also this will allow you to broaden your own personal scientific interests outside of the specific subjects in the course. In writing the course essay you can explore a topic in detail, evaluate what you have read in a critical way and provide your own summary, interpretation and conclusions. Preparation for the tutorials and full participation in these will improve your intellectual confidence and flexibility through trying to understand, evaluate and discuss new information.CommunicationThrough discussion and collaboration with students in practical and tutorial groups you will be able to communicate your views and ideas and to learn from your peers. You are also encouraged to ask questions to your lecturers, practical demonstrators and tutors to expand your knowledge and clear up any misinterpretations you might have.Personal effectivenessTransferable skills acquired throughout your degree programme will benefit you, not only across the courses on which you are enrolled, but in future employment and further study. In this course, as in others, time management is an important skill that you will acquire as you develop ways to organise your work and meet deadlines. Group work in tutorials and practicals is also an important transferable skill and by interacting with fellow students you will become aware of your own skills, talents and limitations; and appreciate those of others.",

    "summary": "This course studies development of the complex organism from the fertilised egg, leading from the control of gene expression, to cell interaction, to the formation of tissues and organs.  It considers the development of many types of animal and plant embryos and also post-embryonic process (control of growth, tissue maintenance, flowering, etc). Major sections of the course include pattern formation (cell lineage, cell interaction); control of gene expression; genetic analysis in zebrafish and in Drosophila (the oocyte, the embryo and imaginal discs); mammalian development; plant development.  The course consists of lectures, laboratory practicals, small-group seminars and data-analysis sessions.",
    "course_description": "The study of development is central to modern biology. It is revealing how multi-cellular organisms form the correct cells, tissues and organs in the right place at the right time, to generate a complex and functional organism. Combining manipulative, genetic and molecular approaches, Developmental Biology allows us to understand the path from genes to organism. Analysis in different species has shown that a surprisingly similar 'toolkit' of developmental mechanisms is used in vertebrate and invertebrate animals and in plants (albeit often using different gene products as the 'tools'). The Developmental Biology 3 course aims to give a broad view of the processes and mechanisms of development in a range of important research organisms.An understanding of development is not only crucial to appreciating how the whole, functional organism is formed, but also to understanding what happens when things go wrong, as in congenital abnormalities or in cancer.We encourage you to go on to Development, Regeneration and Stem Cell Honours in your final year. The Honours programme builds on this 3rd year course, going in more detail into experiments on developmental mechanisms - at levels from embryology and morphogenesis to the molecular control of gene expression, and in many different organisms. We also cover important additional topics such as stem cell biology, human developmental genetics, developmental neurobiology and the evolution of development (what is shared and what is unique to different organisms, from humans to plants). Developmental Biology is truly interdisciplinary, with input from the Science and Medical areas - it is an exciting and intriguing topic and the research career prospects are good.",

The course will introduce a comparison of morphological, physiological and molecular approaches to study the ecology and evolution of plants. Plant-environment interactions also feature in the context of the colonisation of the land by early plants.  We hope that the course will make clear the close linkage between the evolution and ecology of plants - past and present, wild or cultivated.",
    "course_description": "The radiation of land plants over the last 475 million years transformed Earth to the green planet we know today. Land plants have not simply survived during this time but have instead thrived, leading to a plethora of botanical form spanning minute mosses, creeping lycophytes and ferns, towering gymnosperms and flamboyant flowering plants.The aim for the course is to provide an overview of this remarkable radiation. This will be done by focussing in on some of the key anatomical, physiological and genetic changes that have underpinned the diversity of land plants. We will also consider how some of these traits and innovations enable plants to acclimate and adapt to different environments.Telling this story requires an interdisciplinary approach spanning the investigation of fossil plants, living plants and genetic networks. At the beginning of the course, we will introduce some tools and processes that can help us frame the evolution and ecology of organisms, plant included. Fossil plants will be examined in the collections of the National Museum of Scotland. The diversity of living plant species will be explored at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. Plant anatomy and genetic networks will be covered in lectures and practicals.The course will therefore provide a broad overview of plant evolution through time, set out how lessons from the past can reveal information about the future and highlight some of the remaining outstanding questions in the study of plant evolution. The course will also make clear the link between the evolution and ecology of plants (past and present).Recommended second year courses for EEP3 include: Biology 2B: Genetics and Evolution, Biology 2C: Systems and Regulation and The Green Planet 2. The course counts directly towards Honours degrees in Biological Sciences (Plant Science) and is one of a selection of courses recommended for Biological Sciences (Ecology) and Biological Sciences (Evolutionary Biology).

    "course_description": "This course will introduce you about the processes that underlie evolutionary change in natural populations. It is intended to give an integrated view, showing how theoretical approaches can be applied to investigate natural evolutionary processes. We will deal with subjects ranging from the evolutionary fate of molecular sequences to the genetic consequences of interactions between species, and from variation at single genes to speciation.The course starts with population genetics and molecular evolution (Weeks 1-4) emphasising its importance in understanding the process of biological evolution. This is followed by an introduction to the genetics of quantitative characters (Weeks 5-7). The course ends with lecture modules on molecular phylogenetics, mechanisms of speciation, and genetic parasites (Weeks 8-10).The first three sections of the course are associated with computer-based practical classes (which are assessed through digital quizzes online) and live digital \"problem\" tutorials. These sessions are designed to assist with understanding of key concepts, to give practice in problem solving and to develop competence in quantitative analysis. An essay and associated tutorials provide the opportunity for assimilating and synthesising information from the primary literature and discussing its interpretation.",

    "course_description": "Genome sequences are available for most organisms of importance for research in life sciences. Technologies to produce sequence data continue to improve, increasing speed and decreasing cost, so genomic data is now an important part of many research projects. Many of the genes identified in these sequences are still of unknown function and there is a strong drive to develop new methods, both experimental and computer based, that offer the prospect of having complete catalogues of the biochemical or genetic function of every gene in an organism. This information will ultimately provide the basis for understanding living systems and the evolution of organisms at the most fundamental level, with important implications in practical applications in biotechnology and human health. Already knowledge gained from genomics is influencing the way we do science.In this course we introduce and review the development and prospects for genomic analysis. There are three components to the course: a lecture series, computer-based bioinformatics workshops and a practical.In the lectures, through the presentation of key genomes, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, we consider the structure, function and evolution of genomes. We then look at tools, both experimental and statistical, to further our knowledge of genes and their function. We conclude with examples of applications of genomics.In bioinformatics workshops we provide a grounding in important skills for the handling and analysis of sequence data.The practical gives the opportunity to generate and investigate novel genome sequences. We start in a wet laboratory with DNA isolation and preparation of a genome sequencing library for submission to Edinburgh Genomics. The resulting sequences are assembled, annotated and analysed in a computer laboratory.Assessment comprises short quizzes, a practical report and an exam.",

    "graduate_attributes_and_skills": "The University has identified six groups of abilities that should be developed as part of the University of Edinburgh training experience, and to enhance your employability as a graduate for the 21st Century. These abilities take your skill-base beyond basic academic knowledge and are enhanced at each stage of your degree. They relate to Genomes and Genomics 3 in a number of specific ways as outlined below.Knowledge and Understanding: From this course you will develop a broad knowledge of genomes and genomics including the structure, function and evolution of genomes. Computer based workshops provide the opportunity to understand the nature of genomic data and the process of its analysis as well as knowledge of tools to perform these analyses.Research and Enquiry: These skills are enhanced by reading books, research papers and electronic materials to follow up lectures and practicals. They underpin the assessed practical.Personal and Intellectual Autonomy: By reading and preparing materials for sessions, you will learn to synthesise your own views, develop reasoned arguments and refine scientific judgement. In addition, the practical report provides an opportunity to develop and give your own opinions.Communication: This is a key attribute of all scientists and it is therefore important that you develop skills to interact constructively with others and convey knowledgeable and balanced scientific views. We specifically encourage discussion in practical and bioinformatics sessions and the practical report is an opportunity to practise and improve writing skills.Personal Effectiveness: The ability to organise and summarise your thoughts and material in a flexible and accessible way are core features that are required for personal effectiveness. To encourage development of planning and time management skills we provide the course guide and timetable where key events and submissions are highlighted. Success in the practical, held over many sessions, requires careful recording of analyses and results.Technical and Practical Skills: Our course has a strong practical component. As part of your training, skills in computer-based handling and analysis of sequence data are developed. As well as skills specific to genomics, your generic practical skills in critical observation, investigation and interpretation, careful recording, quantification and analysis will benefit.",

Lectures, supported by tutorials and practical classes, which reinforce the key concepts from the lectures, give a sound introduction to modern cellular and molecular immunology, with an emphasis on the experimental systems used to study the immune system.Immunology 3 is a course on the cellular and molecular biology of the immune system, including how it has evolved, how it develops, how it is regulated, and how it responds to infection. It will take you on an exciting journey through cellular function, physiology, experimental systems and key techniques to study immunology and diagnose infections and immunological diseases.The first half of the lecture course describes basic concepts in immunology, including description of the innate and adaptive immune systems, the anatomy of the immune system and an overview of the recognition mechanisms by which foreign antigens are detected. There is an emphasis here on the genetic mechanisms that contribute to the generation of antigen receptor diversity, and the ways in which antigens are handled by antigen-presenting cells. The lectures then move on to look at lymphocyte development and activation, as well as the specific effector functions of the cellular and humoral arms of the adaptive immune system. The regulation of responses by 'helper' T cells and cytokines, and the principles of immunological memory are discussed in some depth. Understanding how the immune system tolerates self-antigens and harmless foreign antigen is discussed, providing a basis for understanding autoimmune diseases.  Finally, the immune system will be discussed in the context of evolutionary biology.Both theoretical and practical aspects of the course will be assessed. The course provides useful background recommended for students with interests in Honours in a number of other subject areas (e.g. Biochemistry, Biotechnology, Infectious Diseases, Biomedical Sciences).",

    "course_description": "The study of the structure and function of eukaryotic cells at the molecular level has been one of the major growth areas in biology over the past decade.  Our understanding of many complex processes such as cell division, differentiation, movement and cell-cell interactions has been greatly extended by use of a combination of biochemical, molecular genetic and immunological methods.This course takes as its starting point the material covered in several of the first-half 3rd year courses and 1st and 2nd year courses, and applies that knowledge to a detailed study of five major topics in molecular cell biology: the cytoskeleton, signal transduction, cell cycle, membrane trafficking and nuclear domains.  As the pace of research in these areas is very rapid, the course will concentrate on techniques and experimental designs used to dissect and analyse these complex processes, as well as looking at current ideas about how they occur.An important element in the course is the opportunity for you to develop the skills of an active learner through taking part in the course's exercises.

    "graduate_attributes_and_skills": "The University has identified a set of four clusters of skills and abilities (see headings below) that we would like students to develop throughout their degree programme to strengthen your attitude towards lifelong learning and personal development, as well as future employability. The graduate attributes we hope to develop within Molecular Cell Biology 3 are indicated below.Research and EnquiryThe course aims to increase your understanding of the general subject area and also obtain specific skills as outlined in the course Aims and Objectives. The knowledge base of the course and the development of research and technical skills will be of benefit to you in completing your degree and beyond. The course will develop research and problem-solving capabilities through the Lab Practical and Web-based projects and through the Hypothetical Research Project.Personal and Intellectual AutonomyTo meet the objectives and challenges of the course, we encourage students both to work independently and also to discuss and debate with other students to strengthen your views as they develop. By reading textbooks and research papers you will expand your knowledge of the topics covered in the lectures, and this will allow you to broaden your own personal scientific interests outside of the specific subjects in the course. In writing the Hypothetical Research Project you will explore a topic in detail, evaluate what you have read in a critical way and provide your own approach to investigating and solving a biological problem.CommunicationThrough discussion and collaboration with students in the tutorials, Lab Practical and Mitotic Oscillator project you will be able to communicate your views and ideas and to learn from your peers. Preparing for your presentations at tutorials will help you to develop effective communication skills. You are also encouraged to ask questions from your lecturers, practical demonstrators and tutors to expand your knowledge and clear up any misinterpretations you might have. There is also a course Discussion Board on Learn which can be used to obtain feedback and to discuss various aspects of the course.Personal EffectivenessThroughout your degree programme you will learn transferable skills that will benefit you not only across the courses you are enrolled in but in future employment and further study. In this course, as in others, time management is an important skill you will learn as you must develop ways to organise your work and meet deadlines. Writing a well-reasoned Hypothetical Research Project will help you to organize your thoughts succinctly and effectively. Group work in the Lab Practical and the Mitotic Oscillator project is also an important transferable skill. By interacting with fellow students you will become aware of your own skills and talents (and your possible limitations) and appreciate those of others.",

    "summary": "Molecular Microbiology provides insight into the fascinating diversity of microorganisms and how they interact with their environment. Many of these interactions are of great benefit to man (e.g. for yoghurt and beer production), as well as harmful (e.g. infectious pathogens). The course explores the basic theory behind several of the most important microbial processes and examines how they operate at a molecular level. The course also has a substantial practical component which is designed to highlight the properties of living microorganisms in action. These practical sessions are aimed primarily at demonstrating how microorganisms can be characterised, controlled or harnessed.",
    "course_description": "The underlying aim of Molecular Microbiology 3 is to provide deeper insight into how microorganisms work at the molecular level. Microorganisms are the most abundant life forms on the planet, as well as the largest natural reservoir of genetic material available to drive evolution. Thus, they have a major influence on the dynamics of the world as we know it. Many microbial activities are of great benefit to man (e.g. for yoghurt, cheese, bread, alcohol, antibiotics, nutrient cycling, detoxification of pollutants), but others are harmful or even fatal (e.g. infectious diseases of plants, animals and humans, such as potato blight, avian \u00c2\u00bfflu\u00c2\u00bf, and tuberculosis).This course explores the basic mechanisms of some of the most important microbial processes at a cellular and sub-cellular level. Some of the key questions we will address are: how do bacteria reproduce? How do they communicate with each other, and build multicellular structures? How do they move? How do they produce toxins and other substances to affect their environment? What constitutes a bacterial genome, and how is it affected by plasmids and bacteriophages? Another section of the course relates to fungi, a large, important and under-studied group of organisms which play major roles in the environment. We will look at how fungi grow, interact with each other (even waging fungal 'warfare'), and cause human diseases. Finally, we will consider viruses, the most abundant and diverse 'organisms'. We will consider the key groups of viruses, their properties, and their significance as agents of infectious diseases and cancer, as well as their varied uses in genetic engineering and therapy.The course also includes a number of key \u00c2\u00bftransferable skills\u00c2\u00bf elements, including a substantial practical component which is designed to complement the lecture course, and to introduce and reinforce the key techniques required for working with microorganisms. There are also student presentations to enhance oral and written presentation skills, as well as tutorials on literature searching and essay-writing.",

This University considers itself to be a research-led Institution and you will be exposed to cutting edge information and ideas as you progress through your degree course. In this course you will develop a comprehensive knowledge of key features and functions of major groups of microorganisms and of how their processes operate at a molecular level.Research and Enquiry: These skills are enhanced by encouraging further reading of books, research papers and electronic materials, to embellish your lecture and practical material. They underpin your ICA material (essay and summary). Understanding how to use Web of Knowledge, in part, prepares you for these aspects. It provides a route to surveying current and past scientific arguments, in an appropriate context, and provides the foundation for hypothesis driven analysis.Personal and Intellectual Autonomy: By reading and preparation of materials for tutorial sessions, you will learn to synthesise your own views, develop reasoned arguments and further refine your scientific judgement. In addition, in this course we encourage self-development through use of past papers and the online assessment system, Question Mark Perception. Such skills will enhance your capacity for life-long and independent learning.Communication: This is a key attribute of all scientists and it is therefore important that you develop skills to interact constructively with others and convey knowledgeable and balanced scientific views. Our Presentation and discussion tutorials provide a forum for this but we also encourage these skills in the Course Debate and the Learn Discussion Forum.Personal Effectiveness: The ability to organise and summarise your thoughts and material in a flexible and accessible way are core features that are required for personal effectiveness.  Planning, time management and reflection are central to this. Of course these features also interlink with your personal and intellectual autonomy. By providing you with a timetable where key submission dates are highlighted, we are encouraging you to develop your effectiveness throughout this course. These same skills extend to other courses and also to your overall ability to maximise your achievement whilst studying at this University. However they also apply to every other aspect of your current and future life. Many aspects of what you achieve in your life can be significantly influenced by you!Technical and Practical Skills: In order to continue in a scientific career it is important that you not only understand the conceptual basis of how experiments are designed and carried out but also that you have the underpinning practical skills required for employability. Our course has a particularly heavy laboratory component which is designed to prepare your for this, as well as to assist you in your future Honours course projects. As part of this, your laboratory training provides skills in basic microbiological techniques, and in safe handling of pathogenic microorganisms. The laboratory skills you develop from your practical sessions, in critical observation, investigation and interpretation, careful recording, quantification and analysis, should serve you well in any future employment.",

To describe the structures of biological macromolecules, particularly proteins, in relation to their functions in catalysis, ligand binding, membrane transport and ability to form and function as complexes, and to illustrate the types of experimental techniques used to study macromolecular structure and function.2. To develop personal skills appropriate to a third-year biological science student, including competence in a range of laboratory techniques; the ability to analyse scientific papers; familiarity with the use of libraries and databases; the ability to present the results of experimental work concisely and accurately, both numerically and in writing, and to write about biochemical and molecular biological topics in a clear and well-organised manner.",
    "course_description": "How does protein structure and their dynamic properties work to produce the great range of physiological responses that we observe in cells? The course provides the basic groundwork necessary to equip a future Honours student in Biochemistry or Molecular Biology to answer this question. However, because of the rapid development of molecular studies and their growing importance in many areas of modern laboratory-based biology, the course is also designed to provide a strong background for students heading eventually for Biotechnology, Genetics, Immunology, or Pharmacology. The information in this course provides the basis for modern drug development strategies and an underpinning for the pharmaceutical industry.The emphasis is oriented towards development as a scientist and to making the transitions to Junior Honours. Experimental techniques and lectures are supplemented with workshops that reinforce this approach. An important feature of the in-course assessment is to introduce students to the scientific literature, both in terms of how to read and how to appraise critically original papers.Practicals provide hands-on experience of currently used laboratory techniques such as electrophoretic mobility shift assay, spectroscopy, electrophoresis, and protein chromatography; development of skills in experimental design and in handling quantitative data are particularly important. Molecular graphics and modelling software is introduced to allow easy manipulation and examination of complex molecules, in order to supplement practical, lecture and workshop material.There are four main themes in the lecture course:(i) Students are introduced to the types of quaternary structure, and their symmetries, that are found in biological complexes.(ii) Then there is an emphasis on how we find out about proteins: about how mass spectroscopy can be used to identity proteins, and to establish stoichiometry of complexes; about how X-ray crystallography, NMR, and cryo e-m are used to determine protein structures; and about how optical methods are used to follow dynamic properties, particularly those related to fluorescence, a major technique.(iii) The third theme is on quantitative analysis of the kinetics of protein:protein interactions and of reactions catalysed by proteins.(iv) The principles established in the first three themes are explored by looking at molecular machines, particularly those that are drug targets: G-coupled Protein Receptors and ion channels, with an introduction to membrane structure.",

Reflective practice is a key part of self-directed learning and continuing professional development. It encourages students to refine and improve their practice, and provides a reference point to demonstrate development over the course of the Honours BMedSci programme. An on-line Reflective ePortfolio will be completed by the student during the Academic Surgery course allowing the opportunity to critically reflect upon first-hand experiences as well as medical texts, in order to develop a critical, evidence-based approach to surgery.Through self-directed learning, on-line content will support and reinforce key concepts relating to surgical study design (formulating a hypothesis and research questions and use of appropriate methodology to address these questions), critical appraisal and reviewing research papers and statistical analysis of data.The Academic Surgery course will explore in more depth and from a research perspective the lectures and seminars delivered during the 20-credit Surgical Sciences course in Semester 1.

    "course_description": "Antimicrobial resistance is an urgent global threat to human health. This course is designed to address the emerging concepts around the interconnected routes of the development and transmission of antimicrobial resistance. As such, the course covers the \"One-Health\" and \"bench-to-bedside\" themes where it links the biological basis of the pathogen and host response, the sociological attitudes towards antibiotic use and prescription and the challenges faced in the use of these drugs in the clinical and the non-clinical context (human, veterinary and environment). Importantly, this course is complementary to existing material being delivered within the other elective courses as we address distinctly different concepts to \"Diagnostics and Therapeutics for Infectious Disease\" and \"Global Health and Infectious Diseases\". This course has been formulated taking into consideration the One Health perspective with the inclusion of both medically trained personnel and scientists in delivering the course materials.",

Formative and summative feedback from this course unit may also inform the design and development of the research project.Topics addressed will vary from year to year depending on which projects and supervisors are available.  However, it is anticipated that students cover the following general aspects of study design and conduct during the research project:1.\tUndertake a literature review to increase knowledge and understanding of the research area2.\tDevelop and refine the hypothesis or research question3.\tDesign the research protocol including a plan of data analysis4.\tConduct the research project5.\tWrite a research dissertation to the standard of an academic publication6.\tPresent the findings and conclusions of the research project to course supervisors and colleaguesStudents are expected to be self motivated and engaged with the chosen project and work.It is anticipated that students will be engaged in work that is achievable within the 12-week time frame.  This may require secondary use of existing data or conducting a library and documentary research based project.  Projects involving empirical  primary data collection will be feasible if the relevant approvals have already been organised by the supervisor, or if there is early engagement of the student at the start of semester 1.",

Students will have considerable freedom to follow up their own  ideas and to decide with project supervisors the exact content of the project.Assessment of these projects will mainly be based on a set of deliverables that will include a dissertation report, oral presentation, a project plan and a lay communications assignment.  A typical report will include 4-5 specialised chapters (one chapter per student, assessed individually) together with a general introduction and an integrated discussion.  While each student will be responsible for a chapter, the final project would be the communal work of the group and thus involve team writing and editing.  A small element of peer assessment will be included in the marking scheme.One purpose of these group projects is for students to learn teamwork, and part of the assessment will be based on the minutes of structured weekly management meetings that the team will hold.There will thus be a preparatory teaching session for all students on project planning and teamworking. Other whole-class teaching sessions will cover statistics/data analysis and the development of skills in lay communication.There may also be opportunities for students who wish to do a laboratory-based individual research project.",

The Hallmarks and Emerging Hallmarks of Cancer will be discussed. The requirement for multiple genetic changes in the development of a metastatic cancer will be illustrated and the role of tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes will be described. The role of DNA repair in preventing genome instability will be discussed and some inherited DNA repair deficiency/ cancer susceptibility syndromes will be described. Alterations in cell cycle control, proliferative cell signalling, and cell death pathways in cancer cells will all be covered. Conventional surgical, radiotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic cancer treatments will be considered and new rational therapies that take into account both individual and cancer biodiversity will be discussed and illustrated for a number of major cancers: breast, ovarian, colorectal, lung, kidney and melanoma. Genetic profiling of cancers, identification of novel therapeutic targets, cancer drug development and clinical trials of novel cancer therapies will all be considered.The course will consist of lectures, with some teacher-led discussions and non-assessed presentations by students working in groups. Before any student oral presentations there will be a feedback session on an assessed exercise where individual students will be asked to prepare and submit a 5-slide PowerPoint presentation on an early topic from the course. Two small group tutorial sessions will discuss recent journal articles on the topics of immune-oncology and invasion and metastasis. A computer lab practical will give students the opportunity to see how cancer bioinformatics is used to identify the key cancer driver mutations in specific cancers and so direct targeted therapies.",

The aim is to understand how these drugs work and where new development is required. The course will introduce the basics of vascular biology, including a practical class on function of the vascular endothelium; as well as blood pressure control and the kidney, and mechanisms of angiogenesis. The course will then cover the major cardiovascular diseases, including the role of the endothelium in protection against vascular disease, antioxidants, and the the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis that can result in thrombosis, myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke.  The course will also address the potential for new treatments to reduce injury associated with MI and to treat heart failure. Non-drug related therapeutics, such as stem cells and microRNAs will also be covered within these topics. The course will be taught as a combination of traditional lectures and linked tutorials based on analysis of original research papers.  Students will be expected to contribute to tutorial sessions and will be required to make presentations to their classmates related to the themes of the course. The teachers on this course are drawn from a variety of backgrounds, mostly active researchers and clinicians from the Centre for Cardiovascular Science, Little France.",

Each student will provide an independent report (1000 words max.) of that published paper for assessment, according to a specified format.Critical evaluation of papers depends in part on being able to understand enough of statistical techniques to make a reasonable judgement about what conclusions may be legitimately drawn from data. Teaching sessions on statistics/data analysis will therefore be held to help develop/consolidate understanding of these issues.A tutorial session will focus on how to construct a balanced evaluation of a specific example paper.",

Detailed content of this course will vary from year to year. A small number of introductory background lectures will be given at the beginning of the course. Students will learn how to critically evaluate research papers and will write a short (assessed) essay in which they discuss the current state of knowledge in a field of their own choosing. Guided by staff, students will choose specific topics that cover recent research described in the primary scientific literature. Examples of potential topics include: neurodevelopmental disorders, ciliopathies, premature ovarian failure, heparanopathies and aniridia. Introductory lectures will explain the background to each topic and give students the information they need to understand the research papers. Typically, students would then read 2-3 papers related to the topic, which would be discussed in a seminar format, likely involving student presentations. Students will have to take a high degree of responsibility for their own learning - they will be required to read around the topics, reading original research papers and reviews. Based upon their learning during the course, students will devise a plan of research to address a question that they have chosen themselves. They will present their research plan in the form of a poster, which will form the major part of the assessment for this course.",

The use of animal models for psychiatric disease will be discussed. The genetics of psychiatric disease and intrauterine programming mechanisms (epigenetics) that affect behavioural development in the offspring will then be introduced. We will examine how the interplay between these systems, genetics and the environment influences susceptibility psychiatric conditions including anxiety and depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. We will also look at how cognition is affected by stress and ageing, and how genetics influences this.There are two teaching sessions each week. Normally there will be a one-hour lecture or seminar. Some lectures will then be followed by student presentations or devoted to formative feedback. Others will be followed by quizzes or other student-led exercises or scheduled time to work on the group project in-course assessment exercise.",

    "course_description": "All students will carry out a 12-week research project in Semester 2. Projects will be supervised by members of University of Edinburgh academic staff. Students will select their project topic either from the list of titles offered using the Biomedical Sciences portal system or if you wish to pursue a particular topic of special interest to you for a project, you yourself must identify an appropriate member of University academic staff who would be willing to supervise a dissertation on that topic. Clinical projects will be available to students early in Semester 1 in order to provide sufficient time for the necessary approvals to be obtained.It is expected that the core module Literature Evaluation and Review, will be carried on a topic related to the chosen project to allow continuity in subject matter over the year.The discipline-specific topics will vary from year to year depending on which projects and supervisors are available.  However, it is anticipated that students cover the following general aspects of study design and conduct during the research project:1.\tUndertake the literature review in semester 1 to increase knowledge and understanding of the research area.2.\tDevelop and refine the hypothesis or research question3.\tDesign the research protocol including a plan of data analysis4.\tConduct the research project5.\tWrite a research dissertation to the standard of an academic publication6.\tPresent the findings and conclusions of the research project to course supervisors and colleaguesStudents are expected to be self motivated and engaged with the chosen project and work.It is anticipated that students will be engaged in work that is achievable within the 12-week time frame.  This may necessitate using data that is already collected, conducting a library based project (e.g. systematic review) or carrying out a supervised lab based project.  Clinical projects will be feasible if the relevant approvals have already been organised by the supervisor, or if there is early engagement of the student at the start of semester 1.",

The brain and the periphery interact in complex neurohormonal networks to control several core, motivated behaviours like eating, drinking, social and sexual behaviour. These behaviours are essential to life, share overlapping control systems and common underlying neurophysiological principles. In addition understanding these systems in health, we will address how these systems are altered in, for example, obesity. The course will be integrative in nature, highlighting commonalities in system control of diverse behaviours.",
    "course_description": "Course DescriptionMost of the behaviours we and other animals engage in are necessary for life or its propagation. Eating is a clear example, as are the social and reproductive behaviours that produce offspring and ensure their care. Many of these motivated behaviours are initiated and controlled by complex patterns of neurohormonal signalling that are, in turn, sensitive to the external environment and the body's physiological state.This course focuses on social, maternal and eating behaviour. These behaviours share overlapping control systems and common underlying neurophysiological principles. In addition understanding these systems in health, we will address how these systems are altered in obesity.The course will be integrative, highlighting commonalities in system control of diverse behaviours. We will discuss the behavioural roles of oxytocin and vasopressin, two evolutionarily-ancient hormones involved in water balance and maternal and social behaviour, and look at vasopressin's roles in social recognition. We will also examine oxytocin\u00c2\u00bfs role in appetite control, and other key homeostatic hormones like leptin and ghrelin. We'll also discuss the crucial role of pituitary hormones in a range of behaviours, and issues around food reward and food addiction.",

    "summary": "The course aims to apply critical cross-cultural perspectives from the discipline of social anthropology to experiences of health, illness, healing, and care practices (including biomedicine). These will be explored in their socio-political and cultural contexts, and with attention to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Students will explore historical and global variation in meanings attributed to and explanations given for illness; healing systems and how these combine in 'therapeutic pluralism' in the lives of individuals and communities; anthropological contributions to implementing global health initiatives and tackling infectious diseases; and cross-cultural perspectives on death and dying. The Edinburgh Centre for Medical Anthropology  in the School of Social and Political Sciences has prompted new local research collaborations between anthropologists and medical and veterinary scientists. The course will draw on these in introducing students in the Deanery of Biomedical Sciences, including intercalating MBChB and BVetSci students, to anthropological perspectives as part of a multi-disciplinary approach to their future careers as medical scientists or practitioners.",
    "course_description": "The course aims to introduce students within the Deanery of Biomedical Sciences to the insights offered by social anthropology, and specifically medical anthropology (the discipline's fastest-growing sub-specialism), to the study of health, illness and healing. No prior knowledge of anthropology will be assumed and the course will be tailored to students' backgrounds as Biomedical Scientists. They will be encouraged to reflect critically on how the evidence generated through social anthropology and the ethnographic method contrasts with the forms of evidence they are more familiar with, the strengths and limitations of each, and how to bring different disciplines to bear on a building a rounded understanding of health, illness and medical practice.The introductory part of the course will establish the relevance of medical anthropology and the ethnographic method to research and medical practice; will provide an overview of the historical development and current debates within medical anthropology; and introduce students to the methodological principles and practicalities of ethnographic research and associated research ethics.The course will go on to apply these to substantive areas of health and medicine. These include historical and global variation in the meanings attributed to and explanations given for illness, trauma and emotional distress; the COVID-19 pandemic; non-biomedical healing systems and care practices, including traditional healing and complementary and alternative therapies; locally variable expressions of biomedicine; medicalisation of aspects of contemporary life through the examples of Post-Traumatic Stress and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorders; the contribution of medical anthropology to illuminating the local contexts in which global health initiatives, including those tackling infectious diseases, are implemented; and death and dying across a variety of cultural settings.This course is tailored to students with a background in biomedical sciences and intercalating MBChB and BVetSci students interested in exploring anthropological perspectives on health and medicine. Some will have been introduced to social science approaches to health in previous courses, for example Health, Illness and Society 3 (MSBM09003) or Health, Ethics and Society (which forms part of the MBChB). However, it is assumed that students have no prior specific knowledge of Medical Anthropology.A scaffolded approach to learning will be taken with careful introduction of basic anthropological methods and initial application of familiar topics such as doctor-patient encounters, moving through less familiar topics and more complex concepts as the course progresses. This scaffolded approach aims at making the course accessible for students who are used to science-based teaching. Course design and layout has been guided by student input from the start, including individual and group interviews with previous students of Health, Illness and Society 3 core course for Medical Sciences students, SEAM and student involvement in a central course-planning workshop (ELDeR).A range of teaching material will be used, including ethnographic accounts, journal articles and fieldwork vignettes, complemented by audio-visual material. Students will be expected to prepare for each class by studying required material in advance. Teaching activities in class will comprise lectures (some delivered by visiting speakers) and tutorial discussions aimed at supporting students in critically assessing qualitative evidence and building arguments. Training in anthropological methods will also include practical exercises of making and recording observations writing fieldnotes and giving peer-to-peer comments in order to enhance critical thinking and constructive feedback skills.Edinburgh's growing reputation as a centre for research and teaching in Medical Anthropology has given rise to lively seminar series and colloquia (put on by EdCMA in collaboration with the Global Mental Health Network and Edinburgh Infectious Diseases). Students will be encouraged to participate in such events.",

    "summary": "In modern societies, the increase in life expectancy is accompanied by an increased risk of aging-associated diseases such as obesity, cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. These diseases pose enormous challenges in terms of life quality and economic burden so that it has become an urgent need for societies to address these health concerns. In an attempt to prevent or effectively treat these disorders, research interest in defining the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases has been particularly intense. We will consider how studies on a variety of animal models have contributed to our growing understanding of the molecular basis of these diseases. In presenting the cellular processes that are disrupted in neurodegenerative disorders, obesity and cancer, particular emphasis will be given to molecular commonalities existing between these diseases, which, at a first glance, seem to have very little in common. We will also critically evaluate the advantages and pitfalls of every model system and the importance of using a variety of different models to gain a thorough understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of a given disease. This course will also highlight how the generation of disease models has made possible high-throughput genetic screens and large-scale proteomic and transcriptomic profiling both in health and disease states. Finally, we will discuss how computational analysis and experimental validation of these large data sets can lead to the identification of a large number of new disease-related genes and, possibly, to the development of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",
    "course_description": "The course includes introductory lectures on the major cellular processes disrupted in cancer, neurodegenerative disorders and obesity. Particular emphasis will be given to mitochondria dynamics  and RNA metabolism as emerging evidence indicate that these processes are common themes in the pathogenesis of these apparently divergent diseases. Among the neurodegenerative disorders, the role of animal models in prion diseases and in the motor neuron disease spinal muscular atrophy will be presented and critically evaluated.  We will consider how a combination of computational analysis together with large-scale genetic and proteomic approaches on experimental models can streamline the identification of new genes and cellular processes involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases.The course will have an ICA component. Students will be asked to outline an experimental approach to elucidate the role of a gene in a specific human disease. As a starting point, preliminary information on the gene and a few specific articles will be provided to the students. Each student will be required to give a 20 min presentation on this experimental outline in front of a committee of two lecturers.Staff members involved in the teaching are: Dr. Andrew Gill, Prof. Tom Gillingwater, Dr. Mandy Jackson, Dr. Giusy Pennetta and Dr. Tom Wishart.",

    "summary": "Receptor-mediated signal transduction is a key process through which extracellular molecules such as neurotransmitters, hormones, growth factors exert controlling influences on receptive cells. A wide variety of ligands, receptor types and intracellular signals allows pleiotropic control of physiological, metabolic and neural activity.The integration of positive and negative influences underpins normal systems function but intracellular signals can crucially also drive alterations in cellular responsiveness to allow for adaptive physiological responses in the nervous system and peripheral tissues. Dysfunction in these processes can underlie pathology, so targeting the molecules and molecular interactions involved is the core theme of many pharmacological therapeutic strategies.The content will focus on the properties and influences of G protein-coupled receptors but will include other receptor types where relevant. We will investigate structure and function, signal transduction and downstream pathways, protein:protein interactions, endocytosis and recycling and newly discovered areas of signalling. We will then focus on related mechanisms such as phosphorylation, protein docking and trafficking, effects on transcription and translation and how these bring about plasticity of responsiveness in normal and pathological conditions in both neurons and examples of peripheral cell types. We will further evaluate whether specific molecular interactions in these processes could represent targets for novel pharmacological agents to treat unmet therapeutic needs.The course will consist of a mixture of lectures and seminars, with focused workshop/debate and tutorial sessions. The in-course assessment will involve a short Powerpoint presentation of a relevant research paper (10% of total mark) and a succinct written analysis of a recent \"Trends-type\" (or similar) review article (20% of total mark).",

Students will also be asked to reflect on the experience of their peers and identify opportunities to enhance their learning.Skills:Research and enquiryStudents will use self-reflection to seek out learning opportunities. Students will also use the newly acquired knowledge and critical assessment to identify and creatively tackle problems and assimilate the findings of primary research and peer knowledge in their arguments, discussions and assessments.Personal and intellectual autonomyStudents will be encouraged to use their personal and intellectual autonomy to critically evaluate learning materials and exercises. Students will be supported through their active participation in self-directed learning and collaborative activities to critically evaluate concepts, evidence and experiences.Personal effectivenessStudents will need to be effective and proactive learners that can articulate what they have learned and have an awareness of their strengths and limitations, and a commitment to learning and reflection to complete this course successfully.CommunicationEffective professionals require excellent oral and written communication, presentation and interpersonal skills. The structure of the interactive (problem-based learning examples, collaborative activities) and assessment elements incorporate constant reinforcement and development of these skills.",

We will discuss how an animals ability to adjust its behaviour under changing conditions is important for its survival in the anthropogenic landscape, using case studies to explore specific examples. We will broadly consider an array of anthropogenic environments within the course literature; however, students will be encouraged to consider their personal environment, and different environments through weekly discussion and course assessments. We will consider key behavioural categories that drive wildlife success under anthropogenic pressures. We will primarily explore foraging flexibility and sociality, as well as considering other behavioural adjustments and risk behaviours. Finally, we will discuss the impact and application of behavioural ecology and its importance for conservation and management strategies.",

    "summary": "Ageing related diseases, including cancer, will form the major socioeconomic chronic health burdens of Western societies this coming century. Whole genome cancer sequencing has highlighted the striking patient-specific cancer bar code, highlighting the unique molecular nature of any tumour. This presents an opportunity to develop personalized therapeutics. Emerging data on the cancer-immunology interface provides a step-change in the development of novel vaccine strategies for tackling the mutated cancer landscape in a patient-specific manner. The course aims to train the student in how tumour neoantigens can be used to develop clinically useful cancer vaccines.",
    "course_description": "1)\tAcademic descriptionBreakthroughs in personalized cancer therapeutics have shown that tumour specific antigens act as key signals for immune-mediated cancer rejection. A powerful paradigm has recently emerged aiming to eradicate cancer through the use of cancer-specific vaccines. Key data from clinical studies demonstrated that (i) anti-tumour T-cells in melanoma patients target distinct mutated neo-antigens, and (ii) ex-vivo stimulated tumour infiltrating lymphocytes contained T-cells recognizing mutant tumour peptides. Animal cancer models demonstrated that tumour specific antigens can stimulate, through a process named immunoediting, the selection and outgrowth of cancer cells that suppress mutant peptide production, reducing cancer immunogenicity. Improvements in our ability to identify neoantigens that can be targeted by tumour-specific T-cells using clinical material has established that mutant neo-antigens can be detected and that their expression regulates tumour rejection. Neoantigen based anti-cancer vaccines, can be based on synthetic proteins, dendritic cells primed with neoantigens, nucleic acids such as RNA, or synthetic viral vectors. Some of these approaches are just emerging in the clinic. Approaches that are amenable for cancer vaccine delivery and immune-regulation create enormous scope for developing innovative biotechnological platforms for translation to the clinic.2)\tOutline contentStudents will gain a critical understanding of how studying the science of cancer genomics can provide insights into personalized cancer vaccinology.The course will cover the molecular, genetic, and clinical aspects of genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, mass spectrometry, immunology, and vaccine vectors that can be used to impact cancer rejection.3)\tStudent Learning ExperienceStudents will learn from research-scientists and industrial colleagues as well as clinicians from the field of human oncology with an interest in vaccine science.  The course is delivered online and is divided into five sessions, each lasting a week. Teaching sessions will be composed of written materials and video presentations, accompanied by guided reading elements (in the form of links to journal articles), as well as independent literature searches.Discussion of the content and reading materials will be posted to an online forum (discussion board). Course tutors will moderate discussion boards and to encourage participation the boards will be assessed.",

    "course_description": "This course will explore the nexus of climate change and health with a particular focus on infectious disease.  Changes in rainfall and temperature with the resultant pressures on water availability, food security, biodiversity and the increase in incidence of natural disasters have changed the infectious disease landscape significantly over the previous decade, significantly challenging infectious disease control and health care system resilience.We will initially explore these challenges with examples that are related to the specific ways in which climate change is expanding the ranges of multiple disease vectors and thus increasing the zoonotic risks and re/emergence of infectious disease. Both zoonotic and animal diseases will be utilised as examples, the latter more so to highlight and explore the nexus in respect to the impact of climate change on food production and foodborne infectious disease. The increased risks of water-based pathogens especially in the context of water security and climate change will also be included.It is essential to consider and recognise the transdisciplinary nature of these issues, so we can then explore the wider relationships of infectious disease, climate related migration and of the emergence of infectious disease.As well detailing the current and contemporary issues associated with the health and infectious disease sequalae of climate change and extreme weather events, this course will explore the challenges of addressing the impacts climate change has on infectious disease control, as well as explore the actionable areas in which the effect of climate change on health, infectious disease control could be mitigated, and public health resilience strengthened.",

    "summary": "Comparative oncology is the integration of studies on naturally occurring cancers in veterinary patients with human cancer biology and novel treatment development. This course will concentrate on veterinary cancer with a focus on companion animals highlighting similarities and differences with human tumour types, how cancer treatment in animals can be improved and how, for example, studies on canine patients can be translated into human medicine.",
    "course_description": "1) Academic descriptionSpontaneous tumours in companion animals (dog and cat) offer a unique opportunity as models for human cancer biology and translational cancer therapeutics. The relatively high incidence of some cancers in companion animals alongside factors such as similarities in environment, body size plus cellular and physiological response to cytotoxic agents, make companion animals much more attractive and informative as physiologically models of human cancer than, for example, rodents. Further, the relatively short overall lifespan of cats and dogs is an advantage when considering comparative oncology as a route into improved treatment for humans. Importantly however, by encouraging studies on animal patients there is also the prospect of providing more treatment options in veterinary oncology.Students will gain a critical understanding of how studying cancer in companion animals can provide insights into the genetic and molecular causes of human cancer. In addition, they will appreciate how studying the response of cats and dogs to novel anti-cancer therapies may provide a more relevant physiologically model for translation to humans. Thus, companion animal research could reduce the high rates of attrition normally encountered when moving from pre-clinical mouse models to human clinical trials.2)\tOutline contentThe course will start with a general overview of comparative oncology and companion animal cancer. It will then move on to cover a number of topics in more detail, including: (1) the underlying genetic predisposition to cancer susceptibility in some breeds which facilitates genome-wide association studies as a powerful tool for unravelling complex cancer genetics: (2) companion animals as a model for cancer in humans, (3) the potential role of companion animal models in translation of new therapies into human clinical trials; (4) development of companion animal cancer specific treatments; (5) cancer types in companion animals and their relationship to human cancer e.g. lymphoma, melanoma, osteosarcoma and brain cancer.The course will cover the molecular, genetic and clinical aspects of cancer and will also look at the radical and ethical differences in treating human and companion animal disease.3)\tStudent Learning ExperienceStudents will learn from research-scientists and academic veterinarians as well as clinicians from the field of human oncology with an interest in comparative oncology approaches.  The course is delivered online and is divided into five sessions, each lasting a week. Teaching sessions will be composed of written materials and video presentations, accompanied by guided reading elements (in the form of links to journal articles), as well as independent literature searches.Discussion of the content and reading materials will be posted to an online forum (discussion board). Course tutors will moderate discussion boards and to encourage participation the boards will be assessed. Students will further evidence their learning by reviewing a grant application (provided to them) in the field of comparative oncology and veterinary cancer. In addition, the students will prepare a lay presentation on pros and cons of comparative studies, in the form of either a powerpoint presentation or 'in a nut shell'.Formative peer and teacher-led feedback will be given throughout the course through the discussion boards, and summative assessment feedback will be provided at the end of the course.",

    "course_description": "The central theme of this course is to provide students with an understanding of how the inter-relatedness of environment and society can impact both ecosystem and human health. There is increasing awareness that human health and wellbeing cannot be viewed in isolation from ecological systems, such as in the concept of 'Ecohealth', which takes a transdisciplinary approach to understanding how environmental change impacts human health.This course will focus on viewing problems holistically, as part of a complex system rather than isolated components. Mechanisms to explore these ecological and societal interdependencies will be discussed, such as systems-thinking. The idea of 'wicked problems' will be introduced, as those issues that lack simplistic solutions due to their interdisciplinary nature and social complexity. In today's society, climate change, poverty, biodiversity loss, habitat restoration, urban planning and wellbeing, have all been described as wicked problems, among many others.Using a case study approach, students will learn about current issues impacting ecosystem and human health, what makes these problems 'wicked' and the role of interdisciplinary strategies for their sustainable management.The course relies heavily on reading primary literature as well as key publications from the conservation sector. Both assessed and non-assessed online discussion fora provide further content and reflection and students are expected to engage with group discussions for both learning and assessment purposes.Course notes are released on a weekly basis and contain links to or references for further reading on the subject of sustainable health. The course requires a time commitment of 12-20 hours of study each week. Students may also source and recommend further reading for the course to their peers by posting relevant links within the VLE.",

The key genetic analyses employed in conservation genetics studies will be described and their technical and theoretical limitations discussed, as will their considerable power to inform key conservation decisions.",
    "course_description": "It is becoming increasingly apparent that measures of genetic diversity should be included in our assessment of species health and future viability, to make the best decisions for their protection and management. As genetic techniques become more sophisticated and reliable, our use of them to support species conservation has similarly increased. We can now use a range of non-invasive sampling techniques to study individuals that we may never see or come into direct contact with, or that have been dead for many years. Exploiting the natural processes of genetic mutation and evolution we can quantify the level and rate of differentiation between individuals, between populations and between species. We can assess the genetic health of populations and the likely consequences of our management plans with increasing certainty.There are many contributions genetic studies can make to better understand species at risk of extinction or decline, and to inform effective long-term management. This course encourages students to investigate a range of examples, and to assess how appropriate genetic studies may be for other species of interest.",

    "course_description": "Despite decades of effort, there is still a long way to go to improve people's conservation values and crucially, reduce environmentally destructive behaviour. With a growing global population and associated demands on the environment, that need is unlikely to change.Conservation psychology (CP) is a new and little known label for interdisciplinary work that aims to improve the effectiveness of conservation messages. It has the potential to modify the way conservation practitioners approach campaigning, specifically by moving away from urging people to care and become environmentally literate. Instead, CP advocates a focus on changing behaviours through i) understanding and utilising cultural and social norms and ii) ensuring people feel that they, their government or campaigners, can really make a difference.A disconnect exists between the theory and application of CP, so its utility is not widely appreciated. This course aims to bridge that research-application gap by describing CP principles and inviting students to apply this knowledge to a proposed campaign.Outline ContentWeekly lectures will begin by looking at the definition and key principles of conservation psychology, moving on to consider its application in developing effective conservation campaigns and how appropriate a tool it is in this respect.Student Learning ExperienceStudy materials are released on a weekly basis, providing an overview of the study topic, suggested reading materials and key questions that address the learning outcomes for the course.  Students are expected to split their time between independent study and interacting with peers and course tutors on the discussion boards in order to fully explore the topic and their understanding of it.  Summative written and online assessment will test knowledge and understanding of the learning outcomes, as well as the ability to communicate with others in a variety of ways.  Both assessed and non-assessed online discussion fora provide further content and reflection, and students are expected to engage with group discussions for both learning and assessment purposes.",

We will explore three main of areas of conservation and conflict namely: the causes and mitigation of human/wildlife conflict; the militarisation of wildlife protection and the impact of human conflict on wildlife and conservation efforts.Human/wildlife conflicts occur worldwide whether crop/livestock management or direct threats to human life as both our population densities and behaviours change. The course considers the implications of such conflicts for livelihoods and species survival.Protected area and species management and enforcement often requires the deployment and use of armed force.  We consider the influence this has on both effective protection and potential escalation of human/wildlife conflict.Finally, we will look at war zones and the implications of the theatre of war for wildlife populations, habitats and ecosystem health.The course is delivered through weekly materials including case studies, online discussions and an interrogation of the growing body of literature on this subject.",

They will learn basic bioinformatics, figure preparation and communication skills to further analyse the data and present their findings to both a scientific and a lay audience. They will learn scientific writing skills to write a small summary of this mini-project and develop new hypothesis based on the findings, which will be developed in a project proposal. By combining these elements, we aim to deliver an authentic learning experience that will give the students a flavour of cancer research and begin to prepare them for future studies.",
    "course_description": "Academic description and outline contentKnowledge of the core principles of research not only allows students to conduct their own research to a high degree of professionalism, but also gives them the understanding required to critically evaluate data generated by others. This course aims to provide students with an understanding of the principles of research design and equip them with the core skills required to conduct cancer research projects in accordance with best research practice and academic integrity. The course is based around a transcriptomics dataset and will be divided into three parts:Part 1: The first section of the course is adapted from a tutorial that forms part of the MSc in Quantitative Genetics and Genome Analysis and has been tested online in a student setting. Students will be given a training dataset from a cancer relevant, Affymetrix transcriptomics study. Using the dataset as a basis, they will be taught basic experimental design and quality control principles such as background detection, transformation and normalisation. They will also be taught how to use the R statistical package and in groups, will analyse the data and perform bioinformatic analysis. Teaching will be through online tutorials, recorded lectures, discussion boards and drop in computer sessions.Part 2: Part 2 of the syllabus will cover figure preparation, scientific writing, scientific communication, public engagement and project design. Students will learn through IAD courses, recorded lectures, sound cloud clips and a variety of exercises using the data generated in part 1. Students will generate new hypothesis based on their analysis of the omics data (or a published manuscript describing omic analysis) and write a project proposal.",

The practice of dialogue has been developed, with palpable results, in the arenas of public participation, organisational development and conflict resolution. And theorising about dialogue is now a recognised strand of scholarship within communication studies.The role of science public engagement practitioners has evolved substantially in the last decade. In addition to their traditional work as science communicators, they are now also expected to act as facilitators of meaningful conversations between researchers, practitioners, citizens and policy makers. Often, those conversations aim to increase understanding and build relationships (dialogue). Sometimes, they also seek to inform decision-making processes (deliberative dialogue). In both cases, public engagement practitioners must be able to facilitate participatory processes that foster interpersonal communication across various divides (e.g. expertise, jargon, values, worldviews). Accordingly, this course enables students to become skilful and reflective facilitators capable of designing and facilitating dialogic processes.",

The communication perspective on dialogue is more of an approach rather than a methodology, a craft rather than a technique which will be explored through readings and examples.",

    "summary": "A dissertation will be undertaken after successful completion of 120 credits and would involve the planning, execution, and reporting of a significant project. The project may be a piece of original research (lab, translational, or clinical), and extensive audit or quality improvement project, or a systematic review.",
    "course_description": "1) Academic descriptionStudents will be asked to research and write a reflective element (10-15,000 words). This may report a piece of original research (lab, translational or clinical), an extensive audit or quality improvement project, a systematic review, or meta-analysis. The subject matter must be relevant to the area of cancer research and we would envisage that it would have both a molecular and translational focus. Before beginning, a detailed assignment proposal must be submitted and approved by the candidate's supervisor, and the organising team.2)Outline ContentThe dissertation would consolidate the knowledge and understanding gained from the first two years/120 credits of study. In providing an opportunity to study a topic in depth, the dissertation would develop further the ability to analyse published evidence and apply the findings of laboratory cancer research to clinical practice.3) Student learning experienceThis feature will require a high level of commitment and application from the candidate and provides a valuable exercise in the writing and presentation of information to a standard that engages appropriately with academic conventions in relation to style, tone, structuring andreferencing. As an integral element of the final year the student will have ready access to a variety of research methods training to provide the skills required for successful completion of the dissertation. Supervision for this element of the MSc will be provided by existing academic staff and subject experts currently employed by the University of Edinburgh or National Health Service staff. Candidates will also be  encouraged, where appropriate, to work closely with senior staff at their home institutions.",

Students will therefore develop personal and intellectual autonomy.Personal effectiveness:Success on the course will require students to be effective and proactive learners. Using the resources of their dissertation supervisor, and the university learning and information environment, students will be encouraged and supported to contribute to their own learning, as well as that of others.Communication:Excellence in the dissertation element of the programme requires the attainment of a high standard of written communication skills.",

Ecosystem services are central to the course with time spent exploring the detail and importance of these services to human health, economic stability and society in general.  The second part of the course looks at various global conventions and initiatives that attempt to mainstream sustainability goals into broader human activity and to achieve internationally agreed targets.The course defines and describes ecosystems and the recognised services to human wellbeing that they accrue.  Current thinking on valuing ecosystem services is explored through multimedia materials.  The Sustainable Development Goals form the core foundation for the second part of the course with an exploration of how, through various initiatives, these can be achieved as well as where barriers may exist.The course relies heavily on reading primary literature as well as key publications from the conservation sector.  Both assessed and non-assessed online discussion fora provide further content and reflection and students are expected to engage with group discussions for both learning and assessment purposes.Course notes are released on a weekly basis and contain links to, or references for, further reading on the subject of ecosystem health and sustainability.  The course requires a time commitment of 12-15 hours of study each week. Students may also source and recommend further reading for the course to their peers by posting relevant links within the VLE.",

While many international conventions have had a clear and measurable impact on aspects of the environment such as migratory species, wetlands etc., there have been calls recently for a complete rethink on global environmental governance policy.It is essential that we give our students the opportunity to develop their thinking on the many ethical and governance aspects of conservation activities. This course will provide a platform for discussion and reflection on a variety of case examples. Students will be encouraged to analyse in depth the many conflicts that can exist in the development and implementation of new technologies or strategies and to come to their own conclusions as to what is acceptable. This course is less focused on what we can' do to consider rather what we should or should not do.",

    "summary": "This course is designed to introduce the student to evolutionary theory and example to help understand the origin and scope of diversity in the living world. The concept of biodiversity is developed and the student will learn how it is measured and managed.The drivers for biodiversity loss, both past and present are introduced and discussed, with particular emphasis on the interaction between human activities and the current acceleration in biodiversity loss.",
    "course_description": "Evolution is such a well-used term that it is easy to feel that we know all about it. Indeed, there are a vast number of topics that we could discuss in relation to its theoretical and practical implications. It is also a term that instils a feeling of things past, of processes no longer relevant. Biodiversity, by contrast, feels like a very current term and one that is becoming ever more prevalent in popular culture. It may seem strange, then, to bring these two concepts together. However, the two are inextricably linked and despite their different eras of conception are both hugely important in relation to conservation and species management today.This series of lectures will cover the basics of evolution, enough to allow an understanding of key issues in terms of species characteristics and vulnerabilities, and as a driver for biodiversity. We will discuss the many on-going arguments regarding what a species actually is, how that definition is vital to appropriate conservation action and how decisions are made regarding what to protect. Ultimately, we will look at the human impact on evolutionary processes in the current time, and so to its impact on biodiversity. We will finish by considering what implications this might have on future health and wellbeing of all species including our own.Study materials are released on a weekly basis, providing an overview of the study topic, suggested reading materials and key questions that address the learning outcomes for the course.  Students are expected to split their time between independent study and interacting with peers and course tutors on the discussion boards in order to fully explore the topic and their understanding of it.  Summative written and online assessment will test knowledge and understanding of the learning outcomes, as well as the ability to communicate with others in a variety of ways.The course relies heavily on reading primary literature as well as key publications from the conservation sector.  Both assessed and non-assessed online discussion fora provide further content and reflection, and students are expected to engage with group discussions for both learning and assessment purposes.Students should expect to spend between 12 and 15 hours per week on reading course materials, engaging with peers and tutors on the discussion boards and preparing assessed work.  It is up to the student how they organise their time from week to week, with course materials and discussion boards available for the duration of the course.",

    "summary": "Infection is a major cause of cancer worldwide. Indeed, viruses are associated with almost 20% of human cancers, which approximates to about 2 million new cases annually. Human papillomavirus (HPV), a focus of this course, is one of the primary causes of infection attributable cancer, with an estimated 8 cases per 100,000 person years.All cancers arise when a regular cell becomes a rebel, hijacking the processes required for normal cell function and controlled cell growth, to eventually invade surrounding tissue and spread throughout the organism. This process is driven by a number of changes at the genetic, epigenetic and protein level. Understanding these changes, how they are induced by oncogenic viruses, and how they can be exploited to eliminate rebel cells, is essential for cancer treatment and prevention.This integrated course will cover all aspects of cancer from initiation by viruses, oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, tumour growth and metastasis, drug development, patient treatment, and prevention at a population level.No matter what perspective the student brings, if they are a laboratory researcher, a clinician, a clinical trialist or a population based researcher, they will learn more about cancer biology.",
    "course_description": "This SCQF Level 11 distance-learning course is designed to promote a deep understanding of all aspects of infection-driven cancer including detection and prevention, biomarkers and diagnosis, therapeutic targets, drug discovery and clinical trials.There will be a strong emphasis on the use of cutting edge methodology and multi-disciplinary approaches to understand and combat this highly complex disease. The course will be delivered using the online Blackboard virtual learning environment with a combination of course materials, discussion boards and blogs.Course materials will cover1.     Oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes and viral initiation of cancer,2.\tThe hallmarks of cancer,3.\tCancer at single cell resolution,4.\tDrug development and precision oncology,5.\tCancer prevention - including socioeconomic influences.The journey of a cervical cancer patient will be included within the course materials to bring together the various aspects of the course and provide students with an authentic learning experience. In this journey, students will be exposed to cancer prevention through vaccination, cancer screening, mechanisms of HPV-driven cancer, a patients perspective on cancer, treatment stratification and drug development.",

    "summary": "This course will illustrate the threat posed to ecosystems by invasive and non-native species. The impact these species can have on local biodiversity and overall ecosystem health is exceeded only by that of habitat loss and is thus a key consideration for long-term ecosystem management and sustainability.",
    "course_description": "This course emphasises the ecology of species 'invasions' to locations in which they were previously absent.  While the focus is on non-native species, the mechanisms of invasion ecology have direct relevance to natural dispersal and colonisation by species and individuals.  This has significance in terms of climate change adaptation, species reintroductions and evolutionary biology.  The course explores the ecological implications of 'invasiveness' that go beyond the presence or naturalisation of a new species.The course explores some of the historical events and activities that have led to the establishment of non-native species and the consequences over time to natural ecosystems.  This theme is carried over to consider contemporary human facilitated species dispersal at a global level and some of the biosecurity regimes and protocols in place to reduce this flow.  Case studies are used to illustrate some of the pathways that have led to non-native species.  Finally, the challenge of facilitating species migration as a means of climate change adaptation in the context of biosecurity are discussed.",

This course will consider the changes we have imposed on land use over the last 100 years and the reasons for these changes. It will then go on to explore the implications of changing land use with respect to food security and the effect this can have on human populations.",
    "course_description": "Over the past 100 years we have seen an unprecedented change in patterns of land use around the globe in response to multiple demands on land resources to accommodate the growing global population. The world's population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, raising questions of whether our existing land and water resources have the capacity to support a world with 2 billion more people. Increasing pressure for land and water has led to the resources we depend on for food being over-utilised and degraded and climate change creates even greater uncertainty as to the long term sustainability of the food resources we rely on.The course will start by examining land use change and investigate the drivers of this change and will then go on to consider the impacts of this land use change on local biodiversity and food production. This will provide the background to discuss the importance of food security and examine current strategies for maintaining food security in light of global population growth. Finally, the course will introduce some of the impacts of global environmental uncertainty, such as climate change.Study materials are released on a weekly basis, providing an overview of the study topic, suggested reading materials and key questions that address the learning outcomes for the course.  Students are expected to split their time between independent study and interacting with peers and course tutors on the discussion boards in order to fully explore the topic and their understanding of it.  Summative written and online assessment will test knowledge and understanding of the learning outcomes, as well as the ability to communicate with others in a variety of ways.The course relies heavily on reading primary literature as well as key publications from the conservation sector.  Both assessed and non-assessed online discussion fora provide further content and reflection, and students are expected to engage with group discussions for both learning and assessment purposes.Students should expect to spend between 12 and 15 hours per week on reading course materials, engaging with peers and tutors on the discussion boards and preparing assessed work.  It is up to the student how they organise their time from week to week, with course materials and discussion boards available for the duration of the course.",

Understanding these factors, and how they interact, will shed new light on disease causation and allow disease reduction through preventative approaches and early detection. In this course, we will explore the mechanisms by which specific lifestyle factors increase cancer risk, what we have learnt from familial cancer syndromes and methodologies being used to identify new genetic variants that predispose to cancer. The emerging importance of gene-environment interactions and interventions that reduce cancer risk will also be covered.",
    "course_description": "Academic descriptionIt has been estimated that 4 in 10 cancer cases are linked to modifiable lifestyle factors and therefore, could be prevented. It is also estimated that inherited, genetic factors play a major role in 5-10% of all cancers. This course is designed to allow students to gain an understanding of the mechanisms by which lifestyle and inherited genetic factors contribute to cancer initiation and progression. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) studies have allowed scientists to identify rare genetic events that are linked to increased risk of developing specific cancer types. Students will learn about this methodology and GWAS data analysis, using local expertise in GWAS studies of colorectal cancer. Finally, the students will cover interventions that can reduce cancer risk such as exercise, vitamin D and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.ContentRecorded lectures, written materials and interviews with trial nurses and specialist clinical scientists will be used to deliver the content outlined above. Problem solving exercises will also be used to develop skills in analysis of GWAS data.Student experienceThis course will cover mechanistic/molecular aspects of cancer, data analysis and clinical application. Contributions will come from scientists, clinicians and trial nurses. Therefore, the course will provide a rich, varied learning experience for the student that will leave them inspired about the topic and knowledgeable about how lifestyle factors promote cancer and the use of genetic data to determine cancer risk, an area that is gaining commercial traction.",

In addition, a clinical overview of cancer will be delivered in week1 to provide the students with a framework in which to study the molecular biology of the disease.",
    "course_description": "1)\tAcademic descriptionOver the past 20 years our understanding of the molecular and phenotypic events that lead to the development of cancer and our appreciation of the tumour microenvironment have been significantly expanded. The capabilities acquired during the multistep development of tumours have been defined as a series of \"hallmarks\", in an attempt to rationalize and manage the complexities of neoplastic disease in humans and other cancer prone species. Acceptance of the widespread applicability of the hallmarks concept in cancer is increasingly likely to affect the development of new means to treat a wide range of cancer types.Students will gain a critical understanding of how a multistep disease process can be \"reduced\" into component processes that are characteristic of the disease but which can contribute to a greater or lesser extent dependent on tumour-type and -environment. Here we will focus on understanding how the original 6 hallmarks of cancer drive the disease and how they may form an opportunity for diagnosis and therapeutic interventions.2)\tOutline contentThe hallmarks of cancer were originally defined by Hanahan and Weinburg in their seminal paper (in 2000). The core properties of cancer development were defined at that time as (1) sustaining proliferative signalling, (2) evading growth suppressors, (3) activating invasion and metastasis, (4) enabling replicative immortality, (5) inducing angiogenesis, and (6) resisting cell death. (Subsequently the list was expanded to include additional hallmarks and enabling characteristics -covered in Cancer Biology II).Week 1 of the course will provide a general overview of cancer from a clinical perspective. Subsequent weeks will elaborate on the core properties of cancer and discuss each \"hallmark\" using clinical examples and molecular explanations. The discussion board will be used to encourage exploration of how various hallmarks are interlinked to drive cancer development and progression, as well as how molecule level knowledge of cancer characteristics can impact on therapeutic developments.Within the course materials we will study tumour type examples to highlight how some cancers are more, or less, dependent on individual cancer hallmarks.3)\tStudent Learning ExperienceStudents will learn from research-scientists and academic healthcare professionals. The course is delivered online and is divided into five sessions, each lasting a week. Teaching sessions will be composed of written materials, interviews and video presentations, accompanied by guided reading elements (in the form of links to journal articles.) as well as independent literature searches.Discussion of the content and reading materials will be posted to an online forum (discussion board). Course tutors will moderate discussion boards and to encourage participation the boards will be assessed. Students will further evidence their learning by researching, developing and presenting a poster focusing on molecular mechanism and clinical implications of their chosen \"hallmark\".Students will post to a weekly E-diary where they can reflect on their learning experience.Formative peer and teacher-led feedback will be given throughout the course through the discussion boards, and summative assessment feedback will be provided at the end of the course.",

How tumour-host interactions influence disease aetiology and are being exploited for therapeutic purpose will be discussed using original research contributions and real-life clinical examples. In addition, how physiological properties of the host such as aging, obesity and lifestyle choices influence tumour initiation and progression will also be covered.Academic descriptionHost components surrounding the tumour (the extracellular matrix (ECM)) are equally important in tumour initiation and progression as tumour cells themselves. These components include fibroblasts, collagen, endothelial cells, infiltrating immune cells (macrophages and lymphocytes), signalling vesicles and soluble factors (growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, and hormones). The ECM is not only impacted by intrinsic tumour properties, but also by physiological properties of the host such as aging, obesity, lifestyle choices and hormonal status.Course contentWeek 1 of the course will provide an overall view of the interplay between the tumour and host and how this interaction contributes to cancer progression and metastasis for various cancer types. In weeks 2 and 3 we will focus on inflammatory infiltrate. We will discuss how cancer cells can regulate the composition of the tumour immune environment to promote evasion of the anti-tumour immune response. Students will learn how this evasion impacts on response to therapy and how it is being targeted by new immune-therapies. We will also explore the bigger picture of how aging and obesity can increase inflammation and how this may prime tissues for tumour initiation and promote tumour progression. In week 4 students will learn the importance of metabolism in tumour growth and how host factors can impact on tumour metabolism. Finally in week 5 we will cover hormone-driven tumours and endocrine therapies that exploit the tumour hormone addiction.Student experienceStudents will learn from research-scientists and academic healthcare professionals focussed on immuno-oncology and endocrine therapy. The course is delivered online and is divided into five sessions, each lasting a week. Teaching sessions will be composed of written materials, recorded lectures and primary research talks delivered by early career researchers working in the field. They will also hear about the impact of new immune therapies from patients (fully consented) and cancer nurses. These materials will be accompanied by guided reading elements (in the form of links to journal articles.) as well as independent literature searches.Discussion of the content and reading materials will be posted to an online forum (discussion board). Course tutors will moderate discussion boards and to encourage participation the boards will be assessed. Students will further evidence their learning by developing a discursive essay focussed on the impact of the immune-oncology revolution and the lessons to be learnt going into the future.Formative peer and teacher-led feedback will be given throughout the course through the discussion boards, and summative assessment feedback will be provided at the end of the course.",

Lectures and practical classes will be supplemented by student-directed learning, based around the Crossman & Neary \"Neuroanatomy: An Illustrated Colour Text\" textbook. For the seminar sessions, students will study and present scientific papers and/or review articles which address the relationship between neuroanatomy and neurodegenerative disease. Each of the five sessions will focus on a different set of neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis and stroke), and will be scheduled to fit with the topic being taught in concurrent lecture and practical sessions (e.g. stroke when taking taught sessions covering blood supply to the brain). The class will be split into 5 groups and each group will be responsible for presenting the papers at one weekly seminar. Presentations will be marked by academic staff.",

It aims to provide students with an awareness and critical understanding of the main concepts and theories around objects and place as relevant to science communication and public engagement (SCPE), and how they can be used to craft compelling story narratives.  It will introduce students to cross-disciplinary perspectives from fields such as Museum Studies, Cultural Geography, and Education, and explore how they are currently manifesting and being transformed within the discipline. In doing so, the course will draw on a range of real-world case studies to demonstrate the interplay between, and ethics of, objects and place in SC&PE.Indeed, the course itself will be \"emplaced\", making the most of local resources such as the National Museum of Scotland and Holyrood Park, while also drawing on global perspective through the examination of international case studies. On completion of the course students will be able to appropriately utilise concepts relating to object and place to develop their own SC&PE practice as well as confidently engage in dialogue with fellow practitioners on the topic.",

This course will introduce students to the basic technologies that underpin the generation of omic datasets, describe the principles of the different components of a cancer cell in relation to measurement by omics technologies and give an overview of the most commonly used omic approaches (eg genomics (DNA), transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (protein), metabolomics (metabolites)) both at the theoretical and practical level. Students will also learn about the latest advancements in single cell approaches, which are critical when examining heterogeneous tissue such as cancer, and in liquid biopsy methodology. Finally, they will learn how omics approaches are being integrated to improve overall understanding of tumour biology, identify therapeutic targets and \"make precision medicine more precise\".",
    "course_description": "Academic descriptionAn evolution in technologies is allowing scientists an increased ability to quantify the different layers of biological elements that contribute to the emergence and development of malignancies. These \"omic\" technologies are aimed at providing the universal detection of for example, genes, mRNA, proteins, metabolites and lipids. Multi-omics integrates these technologies, which is very powerful as it gives a holistic molecular understanding of each individual tumour and its microenvironment. Combining this depth of molecular understanding with clinical and treatment outcomes allows scientist to understand why cancers of the same type may differ in their invasive potential, responsiveness to chemotherapy and their ultimate outcome. This understanding can be used to identify new drug targets, stratify patients and improve personalised therapies.Students will gain a deep understanding of the theory and practical aspects of multi-omics technologies and how data generated from these technologies can be translated to improved patient outcomes.Outline of contentThe course will use videos, illustrated materials and recorded lectures to give the students a practical understanding of the technologies used to generate various omic and multi-omic datasets, both at the bulk and single cell level. It will draw on the literature (by way of journal clubs) and local examples (recorded lectures/interviews) to illustrate how multi-omics data is being directly translated to patient benefit. The importance of liquid biopsies, biobanking and linked electronic health record data to realise the potential of multi-omics, will also be covered.Student experienceStudents will learn from clinician-scientists and academic research scientists who work at the interface between the laboratory and the clinic. The course is delivered online and is divided into five sessions, each lasting a week. Teaching sessions will be composed of recorded lectures, interviews, journal clubs and video presentations, accompanied by guided reading elements (in the form of links to journal articles.) as well as independent literature searches.Discussion of the content and reading materials will be posted to an online forum (discussion board). Course tutors will moderate discussion boards and to encourage participation the boards will be assessed. Students will further evidence their learning by researching and developing an essay focussed on the subject areaFormative peer and teacher-led feedback will be given throughout the course through the discussion boards, and summative assessment feedback will be provided at the end of the course.",

It will reinforce the importance of how molecular biology underpins the clinical development of a novel drug or biomarker.  Students will study several novel classes of drugs from 'bench-to-bedside' including facets of drug development, preclinical and clinical assessment plus clinical applications. In addition, they will gain an understanding of modern clinical trial design and its challenges. This course aims to inspire the students with recent success stories from the university and partners, and equip them with skills in the application of molecular oncology and precision medicine.",
    "course_description": "Academic descriptionThe development, assessment (in preclinical model and clinical trials) and clinical application of novel agents is the ultimate goal of a 'bench-to-bedside' approach to molecular oncology and precision medicine. Students will therefore look at every stage of this process using recent examples of new drugs/biologics and 'in-development' approaches.  Both success stories and failures will be used as examples to facilitate learning.Outline contentThe course will begin by providing an insight into methodologies used to design drugs that act on a specific, known target, and how drug screens are designed and implemented. Given the presence of the phenotypic screening unit in Edinburgh, phenotypic screens will be a focus. The utility of pre-clinical evaluation and the pipelines from the laboratory to the clinic will also be covered using stories from local experts and collaborators.  Students will be given an overview of phase 1 clinical trial design, which will draw on their teaching in statistics and provide further training regarding power calculations. There will also be discussions on how we assess a patients response to therapy.Student Learning ExperienceStudents will learn from both research-scientists and academic and clinical healthcare professionals. The course is delivered online and is divided into five sessions, each lasting a week. Teaching sessions will be composed of written materials and video presentations, accompanied by guided reading elements (in the form of links to journal articles) as well as independent literature searches. There will also be video presentations or interviews with patients where possible.Students will put their learning into practice by preparing a Dragons Den style pitch to pharma and developing their own mini clinical trial proposal, involving a drug or biomarker (or both) of their choice.Formative peer and teacher-led feedback will be given throughout the course through the discussion boards, and summative assessment feedback will be provided at the end of the course.",

The course is designed for students who have little or no experience in quantitative social research methods.",
    "course_description": "The first part of the course is intended to introduce students to the practices of social research, including the idea of research design. We explore cross-sectional and longitudinal research designs and case study research and explore how to plan a research project. We look at the importance of the literature review, of developing research questions and the ethical considerations when conducting social research.Students will then move on to learning about quantitative research methods.We will explore the nature of quantitative research, whether all social phenomena are appropriate for quantitative research methods.We will look at sampling and what we can infer from a sample selection. We then move on to data collection methods and explore these as practical exercises in class i.e. questionnaires, structured interviewing, structured observation, quantitative content analysis and secondary data analysis.We focus on exploratory and descriptive data analysis then statistical tests.We explore tools which are available for quantitative data analysis including software packages such as Microsoft Excel and SPSS.  We study methods of analysis and how to interpret and present findings.The course will then explore the use of a 'mixed methods' approach i.e. combining quantitative and qualitative research methods.Students will critically analyse examples of research projects before progressing to using data to develop appropriate research methods to analyse the data.The emphasis is on learning and understanding by doing, using 'real' data and practice in class.  The aim of the course is to ensure that students understand basic quantitative method and how to combine them with qualitative methods when appropriate.The material covered on the course will help students develop a critical understanding of why quantitative analysis can be useful within the social sciences (and in particular for science communication, public engagement and informal learning topics) the pitfalls associated with quantitative analysis and provide an introduction to the key analytical techniques used in published social science research.Learning will be facilitated through a mixture of formative and summative tasks.",

This is encouraged by the diverse portfolio of programmes that the graduate may have chosen to include in their learning experience, challenging themselves both within their current sphere and also outside their normal comfort zone.To be creative and imaginative thinkers, a feature that will have been enhanced by the variety of assessment methods though which they have been challenges to present, re-imagine, or discuss their learning materials.Part-time, online learners will have learnt to be able to identify processes and strategies for learning.  There is no rigid structure to their learning environment, beyond the established deadlines for continuous assessment.  It is for the student to adapt their own circumstances to meet the challenges for this programme, continuous reflection; self-evaluation and self-improvement are fundamental skills in this process.  This ensures an independent approach to assimilating knowledge and the knowledge of where to find relevant, additional resources and information.The self selective student cohort, are all working professionals with a clear vision of where this qualification will place them within their own career pathways.  The pace of learning and the support of a similarly minded cohort help ensure that these goals are achieved in a sustainable manner.Graduate Attributes: Skills and abilities in CommunicationTo make effective use of written and visual means to critique, negotiate, create and communicate understanding.  While oral skills are encouraged, until we are certain that the use of these technologies in our online programmes will not prohibit the contribution of any student due to their geographical circumstances, this suite of technologies has not been fully implemented.The use of communication as a tool for collaborating and relating to others is vital in these online programmes, the vast majority of information is text based and students must be able to clearly present their thoughts, ideas and the logical progression of a discussion to one another.Seek and value open feedback to inform genuine self-awareness.  While on programme students are also encourage to participate in peer review, providing open and honest feedback in a clear and supportive manner.  This open dialogue is vital in furthering the understanding of how their own performance might be improved.Recognise the benefits of communicating with those beyond their immediate environmentsUse effective communication to articulate their skills as identified through self-reflection.Graduate Attributes: Skills and abilities in Personal EffectivenessThe development of confidence in their own skill set, and to appreciate and use their talents constructively, this is taken to include the ability to make decisions based on their understandings and their personal and intellectual autonomyTo create and harness collaborative opportunities through the development of professional networks, and knowledge of potential funding streams and other financial opportunitiesTo be able to flexibly transfer their knowledge, learning, skills and abilities from one context to anotherTo understand social, cultural, global and environmental responsibilities and issues though membership of a global community of practise.   This community encourages students to work together to capitalise on their different thinking, experience and skills in order to progress their knowledge and understanding.To work with, manage, and lead others in ways that value their diversity and equality and that encourage their contribution to the organisation and the wider community",

    "summary": "This course will introduce you to the worlds of knowledge mobilisation and policy as practice. It will enable you to understand and develop your role as a knowledge broker in policy contexts, and will provide you with analytic tools and practical skills for reflective practice.In this course we actively explore, through theory and practice, the role of the knowledge broker as a practitioner who connects research, policy and practice by effectively mobilising knowledge and fostering interfaces between organisations (e.g. research centres, government agencies, public services), people (e.g. research and policy communities) and materials (e.g. research reports, policy documents).The course provides you with a grounded understanding of policy as a field of practice and policy-making as a rich, non-linear process, in which you can become an active agent. Accordingly, the course aims to enhance your capacity to critically analyse the interface between science and policy in your area of work, thus enabling you to develop the 'know-how' to actively engage in shaping it.The work of a knowledge broker unfolds at the junction of two current trends in terms of knowledge and policy, namely the research impact agenda and the evidence-informed policy-making agenda.This course's objective is to prepare you to thrive in such context by developing your analytical skills and capacity for reflective practice.",

The students will plan, propose, deliver, reflect upon and evaluate their teaching.The students will prepare an initial document outlining the proposed elements of teaching in which they will be involved which will be discussed with the course organiser.The students will produce a document detailing the elements of teaching in which they have been involved including training, preparation and the teaching and assessment experiences.The students will prepare formative reflective blogs (2 blogs of up to 500 words each) related to their experiences, as evidence of their learning. Students will receive formative feedback midway through the course a) on their interim summary document of activity and b) on their blogs (which are in the same format as the final reflective blogs).The students will complete their summary document of activity, prepare final reflective blogs (2 blogs of up to 500 words each) and a self- evaluation report 500 words (not assessed).The structure of the course uses the Student-Led Individually Created Course (SLICC) idea and utilises the generic learning outcomes of a SSLIC to enable the students to articulate their learning in their own teaching practice, reflect in formative assessments, and evidence their learning and development.The SSLIC format encourages the critical appraisal by students of their own practice and allow them to reflect on their learning about teaching in Higher Education.",

    "summary": "This course will present the principle activities of the 'modern zoo', based around their common goals of education, conservation and research in addition to their more traditional role as visitor attractions and entertainment centres. There will be examples of how zoological collections can contribute to conservation efforts, from providing funding to in-situ projects, to education for visitors on conservation themes, to the conservation breeding of threatened species.",
    "course_description": "The long history of people keeping animals for interest and entertainment points to a deep connection between humans and their wild animal counterparts. The establishment of exotic animal collections and the exchange of animals as gifts between nations also points to the inherent value people have placed on them.Weekly lectures will present a range of primary literature and zoo-based online resources around the four key activities of what might be considered a Modern Zoo:1. Animal collections for public exhibition2. Conservation3. Research4. Education and communicationStudents will be encouraged to consider the validity of these activities and their own personal opinion on what should be most important in a modern zoological collection.",

    "summary": "In this course students will examine the nexus of Food Security and Global Health by focusing on three areas: malnutrition, food production systems and climate change. Thematic analysis will interlink throughout the course allowing the students sufficient focus within these broad areas. A One Health vertical thread will run through the course incorporating human health, livestock production, crop science, aquaculture, animal health and the challenges that climate change poses, thus aiming to be a course that in addition to exploring the current and historical context of food security in a health context, also seeks to inspire independent thought and pique interest in addressing the challenge of sustainability.",
    "course_description": "Food security is defined as \u00c2\u00bfexisting when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food which meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.\u00c2\u00bf (FAO, 2017).Food security is a broad transdisciplinary area which, at it\u00c2\u00bfs conception, focused on food and food production. Today it encompasses every discipline, from politics and economics to chemistry, soil science and the agriculture sciences.This course aims to take a focused approach, in-keeping with the current topics and overarching themes of the Global Health Academy, this course will explore the nexus of Food Security and Global Health which incorporates both human and animal health elements with a global One Health vertical thread running through and linking the topics over the 5 week period.Gaining a sound base, so as to appreciate the context historically and going forth, the terminology and the disciplines that come under the Food Security umbrella and the global picture as to why the area is so critical will be introduced. The main body of the course will start with the human health consequences of food insecurity: undernutrition, the sequalae of which include chronic hunger and wasting (stunting). The triple burden of malnutrition will be defined, thus expanding the focus to include the consequences of excessive net energy feed intake and nutrient deficiencies. The effects of undernutrition and malnutrition are wide ranging and the coverage will reflect this, with chronic child malnutrition (stunting), obesity, anaemia, reduced immune response, cardiovascular disease covered.Moving forward food systems, climate change and food production nexus will be explored. It\u00c2\u00bfs long been recognised that \u00c2\u00bfIn a highly centralised and industrialised food supply system there can be no small disaster, whether it be a production \u00c2\u00bferror\u00c2\u00bf or corn blight, the disaster us not foreseen until it exists, it is not recognised until it is widespread\u00c2\u00bf (Berry, 1996). The increasing oligo- and in some cases monopolisation of food industries will be introduced and examples will be drawn both from history and from more recently, the 2007-2008 world food crisis will be a focus on which to draw together and contextualise the economics and policies relating to world trade in food products and food systems.The final, yet arguably most important, area of focus will be food production, with a strong focus on livestock systems, crop and aquaculture sciences and food safety, in keeping with the One Health theme. The challenges of production, sustainability, food waste and intensification will be addressed under the thematic heading of climate change.",

This course will look in-depth at current wildlife trade, both legal and illegal, the various forms it can take and the drivers for it.  The key role of CITES in regulating wildlife trade will be explored, as will other relevant legislation.  Impacts of wildlife trade will be discussed with reference to both species conservation and human health and wellbeing.Study materials will be a mix of weekly lecture notes, case studies, guest lecturers and peer discussion.  Study materials are released on a weekly basis, providing an overview of the study topic, suggested reading materials and key questions that address the learning outcomes for the course. Students are expected to split their time between independent study and interacting with peers and course tutors on the discussion boards in order to fully explore the topic and their understanding of it. Summative written and online assessment will test knowledge and understanding of the learning outcomes, as well as the ability to communicate with others in a variety of ways. Both assessed and non-assessed online discussion fora provide further content and reflection, and students are expected to engage with group discussions for both learning and assessment purposes.",

It is intended to be your own work - based on your own research study or literature review. Of course, you will be working closely with your supervisor (and possibly one or more local advisors) but ultimately the dissertation is yours and should reflect what you want it to do.Before starting work on the dissertation, a detailed proposal (the Concept Note) must be submitted and approved by the Course Team; this concept note formalises your ideas and contains sufficient detail to frame the direction of your research and the information or resources that you plan to draw upon. Your supervisor will be assigned based upon the ideas presented within this document.It is important to be aware of the time commitment required to complete this piece of work, as a stand-alone 60 credit course the expectation upon your time is the same as a full year of part-time study - this equates to around 4-600 hours. It is important to manage your time effectively, and set realistic milestones throughout the year; a dissertation that will do credit to your ability cannot be completed in just one or two months - so please do not delay engaging with this activity.",

For many diseases the prospect of improved diagnostics capabilities in both laboratory and at point of care (POC) is fast becoming reality. Whilst the global burden and impact of non-communicable diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease is steadily increasing this course focuses on infectious diseases, both for diagnosis and for prognostication, and where relevant for directing treatment.Whilst these diagnostic advances provide the ideal One\u0002Health opportunity for students from both human and veterinary/animal health backgrounds to come together and consider these applications across their respective disciplines, the course opens by firstly considering the importance of diagnostics in global health and alsointroducing the range of diagnostics utilised. A point of care (POC) thread runs vertically throughout this course with both laboratory and POC applications for various platforms considered. The role of diagnostics in refining the use of antimicrobials across human and veterinary species is a key theme. Towards the end of the course consideration is paid to the area of biomarker discovery and other future perspectives relevant to the area of diagnostics.",

The practical skills will include both the theory and practice of some of the most widely used techniques. This course will build on the knowledge and understanding acquired from the first year courses as well as integrating material covered in all the second year courses.1) Academic Description - the aim of this course is to introduce the students to some of the applied aspects of the material that they have been learning in other courses. It will be a point of integration for the content across the year between the different courses as well as enhancing learning within each of the different courses by further developing a variety of practical and professional skills.2) Outline Content - the following is indicative and all will be taught in the context of what is happening in the other courses; that is, relevant examples will be drawn from the material being covered that week in other courses.Practical classes- the practical sessions will be designed to reinforce and extend learning in the other courses. Students will be introduced to some of the techniques used by biomedical research scientists.Pharmacology- introduction to what is a drug and the general principles of how drugs act (agonists/antagonists; high/low affinities et cetera); drug distribution (off target effects); metabolism (half-lifes, prodrugs); pharmacokinetics (including saturation kinetics).Pathology- introduction to pathology. Etiology and pathogenesis of different examples of pathology. Techniques used to identify/differentiate between pathologies. Interventions may refer to content in pharmacology sessions to close the loop.Biometry = quantitative and computational biology- Basics of probability/statistics: normal distribution (how to describe it, 68-95-99 rule, why it comes up a lot); correlation and causality; logical basis of reasoning: sufficient and necessary conditions (relates to developmental biology), if-then, and, or statements; 'exists' vs 'for all' statements- descriptive statistics: visualising data 1: commonly used plots and how to produce them; visualising data 2: understanding and critiquing plots; conditional probabilities; absolute vs relative risk- inferential statistics: hypothesis testing (did a general intro to hypothesis tests, Chi-square tests and t-tests in Year 1, but it would be good to have a refresher and re-visit t-tests for instance); non-parametric hypothesis tests (e.g. Wilcoxon ranked sum test), probably depends on 'Normal distributions'; correlating two variables; analysing time series; variation 1: sources of variation; variation 2: Analysis of Variation (ANOVA); common mistakes: p hacking, multiple testing,- experimental design: sampling, dangers of pseudo-replication; calculating power- statistical literacy: how to assess statistical information in papers; what to look out for when reading data analysis sections of research papers https://github.com/MelanieIStefan/understanding_data_analysis_in_papers- working with data: data formats and 'how to share data with a statistician' (see also https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing); open data, open science; using Excel; using R; cleaning data- computer literacy: basics of progamming (variables, loops, if statements); using a literature/reference manager; version control; building and using a website; getting help from online forums; reporting bugs3) Student Learning ExperienceEach semester there will be 4 x 3 hr practical sessions. Practical classes will be designed to introduce the students to techniques that a biomedical scientist might use in the context of material covered in one of the courses. These sessions will be written up as short laboratory reports. In the remaining 10 weeks for each semester there will be: 1 x 1 hr session dedicated to developing the students working understanding of biometry; and 1 x 2 hr session devoted to either pathology or pharmacology. If appropriate both of these topics may have a practical element; for example, examining by light microscopy relevant histological preparations of pathology.The emphasis in this course will be on the practical application of knowledge and the development of relevant practical and professional skills as well as integrating learning from across all courses within the year.",

The course will provide an overview of the regulation of gene expression by transcription, chromatin, mRNA stability, translation and post-translational processing, incorporating evaluation of the roles of promoters, polymerases, and transcription factors. It will evaluate the molecular mechanisms underlying replication, repair and recombination of DNA and the importance of the accuracy of these processes in relation to the different types of DNA damage and the diseases that result from defective repair mechanisms. Key to developing this knowledge will be a parallel development in understanding of experimental approaches and genomic technologies used in the analysis of the structure and expression of genes and genomes including the use of model organisms. Approaches for identifying causative genes underlying human disease, the genetic manipulation of animals for modelling disease and investigating gene function and genetic approaches to treating disease will also be addressed alongside encouraging an awareness of projects, and their implications, investigating the human genome, population screening, genetic testing of individuals, pharmacogenetics and its applications.",

There will be 3 major themes: principles of animal development, the molecular and genetics processes underlying those principles and investigation of how these processes come together to form the varied components of animal bodies. This final theme will also be explored in the context of developmental disorders. The course will consist of lectures, tutorials, and problem-based learning sessions. There will be a strong emphasis on problem solving, encouraging students to learn how experimental approaches can be used to answer biological questions, and how the outcomes of such experiments can be interpreted.",

There will be 3 major themes: principles of animal development, the molecular and genetics processes underlying those principles and investigation of how these processes come together to form the varied components of animal bodies. This final theme will also be explored in the context of developmental disorders.The main aim of the course is to provide foundational knowledge in the principles of developmental biology. The overarching theme will be the molecular processes which drive development. The roles of these processes will, where appropriate, also be explored in adulthood. Animal development relies on the coordination of multiple process and understanding the implications of defects in individual elements of this complex interplay will be a major focus of the course. Problem-based learning will be used to enable students to develop group-directed team-work skills.",

The functions involved in maintaining/regulating the example of homeostasis will be studied in further physiological detail to illustrate the mechanisms involved at both the cellular and molecular levels. Some examples of pathology will be used by the students to demonstrate their understanding of how dysfunction in one body system can result in dysfunction in other body systems as the body attempts to maintain homeostasis.

Examples of homeostasis will be used to introduce the body systems involved in each example. The anatomy (both gross and fine) of each body system will be studied as well as an introduction to its functions. The functions involved in maintaining/regulating the example of homeostasis will be studied in further physiological detail to illustrate the mechanisms involved at both the cellular and molecular levels. Some examples of pathology will be used by the students to demonstrate their understanding of how dysfunction in one body system can result in dysfunction in other body systems as the body attempts to maintain homeostasis. Likewise there will also be some examples of pharmacology used where relevant with similar purpose.2) Outline ContentThe course content will be divided into four main topics and within each of these topics the anatomy and general functions of the relevant body systems will be studied. Physiological processes relevant to the aspect of homeostasis being studied will be investigated in both cellular and molecular detail where relevant. Relevant aspects of anatomy, pathology and pharmacology will also be studied.The four topics are:i. body fluid and pH homeostasiscardiovascular, respiratory, excretory, nervous and endocrine systemsii. calcium and phosphate homeostasismusculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, excretory, integumentary, nervous and endocrine systemsiii. glucose and energy homeostasismusculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, excretory, nervous and endocrine systems and adipose tissueiv. maintenance of homeostasis in pregnancy (to demonstrate how a change in physiological status requires adaptations in homeostasis)reproductive, nervous and endocrine systems3) Student Learning ExperienceThis course will be delivered as a mix of lectures and tutorials. The syllabus for this course will be arranged in a less conventional way (that is, it will not involve systematically working through each of the body systems) in order to emphasize that more than one body system is involved in the regulation of homeostasis and hence the maintenance of good health. The overarching aim of this course is not only that the students understand the importance of the integration of the functions of each of the body systems but that they also understand the importance of integrating all aspects of their learning. Students will be encouraged to appreciate that learning in other courses is of relevance to their learning and understanding in this course and to actively make links between learning in different courses: this appreciation will be assessed as part of one of the in course assessments. There will be active learning of how to comprehend, analyse and interpret original research articles and this too will be assessed in one of the in course assessments. Students will be encouraged to engage in self-directed learning through the use of case based problems.",

Place clear emphasis on formative feedbackIt is also important to introduce key concepts of quantification and analysis at this early stage. It is anticipated that investigative practical work will allow an appreciation of the importance of experimental design including use of appropriate methodology, management, analysis (use of appropriate statistics), presentation and interpretation of data and comparison with other work.Nevertheless, the need to foster the development of technical/scientific English language communication skills will be met by embedding this in workshops, facilitated group discussions, tutorials.

The course will both provide basics of microscopy and introduce commonly-used software with the aim of highlighting key steps of image processing and analysis where information loss or distortion may occur. As image analysis commonly requires application of various algorithms, the practicals of this course specifically aim to bridge the gap between the theoretical knowledge and application of algorithms.

The overall aim is to show how the range of disciplines in the Biomedical Sciences have jointly contributed to understanding disease pathways, and how the research approaches used in these disciplines has improved treatment and prevention approaches.The course will be book-ended by an introductory week and a consolidation week. The remaining 12 weeks will be devoted to 1- 2 week blocks focused on a specific disease state. Examples include:- Cancers- Type 2 Diabetes- Neurodegenerative diseases- HIV/AIDS- Stroke- AsthmaTaking this broad approach will allow us to encompass all the major disciplines in the Biomedical Sciences (including physiology, pharmacology, neuroscience, biochemistry, endocrinology, and so on), and discuss multiple complementary research approaches to understanding disease, and advancing its treatment and prevention.This will be achieved by integrating lectures and practicals/workshops. Each week will feature three 1h lectures where students learn about the pathophysiology behind these disease states, and current, emerging (and failed) approaches to their treatment and prevention. Lectures will be supported by a weekly 3 h practical or workshop. These will focus on the development and application of current research techniques and approaches.Learning objectives will be assessed entirely using summative in-course assessment, supported by in-course formative assessment.",

    "course_description": "This course gives students the ability to apply and improve strategies and pipelines for biomedical image analysis. The course will build and expand on knowledge of image and data analysis gathered throughout previous years. From this basis, it will provide students with the opportunity to understand and use an array of algorithms for image processing and analysis and prepare them to be able to develop ad hoc strategies for specific problems they may encounter in real-life situations. This course aims to equip students with skills that will apply to analysis of a wide range of types of biological images, from 2D and 3D photomicrographs, medical images such as MRI scans, as well as time-lapses, e.g. from calcium imaging or behavioural experiments. The course will expose students to common, yet often complex, problems in image analysis, and suggest tools and algorithms for solving them; these include, for instance, image segmentation, particles and object tracking, contour tracing, object labelling and classification, image registration in 2D and 3D. Python will be used throughout this course as it offers a vast array of open-source libraries dedicated to image analysis.",

    "course_description": "The main topic of this course is the molecular processes occurring at, in or across the lipid bilayer, mediated by membrane proteins. The aim is to provide an understanding of the function, structure and organisation of the membranes proteins, with the main focus on ion channels.Membranes play crucial roles in the function and architecture of cells, as they allow the exchange of signals, solutes and ions between the inside and outside of the cell, and define sub-cellular compartments. As the membrane itself is a passive hydrophobic barrier, proteins embedded in the lipid bilayer fulfil crucial roles in the functions described above. This course will cover concepts and research techniques in membrane proteins, with a special focus on the ion channels, while we will also mention the roles of transporters, pores and other medically important membrane proteins. These membrane proteins are key players in cognitive processes, such as learning and memory, and also for muscle function, including the heart, but are thought to have important roles in a wide array of diseases including cancer, and kidney and lung disorders. This course will also provide an overview of membrane protein biogenesis, interactions, dynamics and medical importance, as many of the proteins are involved in diseases and are due to their unique position- prominent drug targets.",

Regenerative medicine seeks to restore the function of damaged tissues in patients suffering severe injuries or chronic disease. The self-renewal capacity and multipotent differential potential of stem cells make them idea tools for regenerative medicine. Thus, stem cell applications in tissue repair and disease therapeutics will be the core theme of the course. Problem-orientated learning will be used to develop experimental design skills.",

    "course_description": "The course will introduce modern applied veterinary epidemiology and its current scope.Epidemiology is concerned with the prevention and control of disease in human and animal populations. Veterinary epidemiology additionally includes the investigation and assessment of other health-related events, notably productivity.The word 'epidemiology' is derived from Greek roots, whose other constructs, such as 'epidemein' ('to visit a community'), give hints of the early association between epidemiology and infections that periodically entered a community (e.g., the great plagues such as foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest and smallpox), in contrast to other diseases which were usually present in the population.Outbreaks of disease in human populations were called 'epidemics', and in animal populations were called 'epizootics', from which the term 'epizootiology' was derived (from the Greek  - (zoo-) = animal). However, many infections (the zoonoses) affect both animals and humans, and the semantic differentiation between studies involving human diseases and those concerned with animal diseases therefore is considered unwarranted. Thus, 'veterinary epidemiology' is now preferred to 'epizootiology', although the latter term still persists in some parts of the world.The course will focus on the basic measures of disease occurrence, overview of transmission and the patterns of disease, necessary basic statistics, surveillance, field survey design and conduct, observational studies and diagnostic testing.Teaching material is delivered online through the university\u00c2\u00bfs virtual learning environment. Students are expected to engage with staff and fellow students through discussion boards.

    "course_description": "Livestock play a pivotal role in the livelihoods of communities in rural Africa and thus factors affecting the health and productivity of livestock are important constraints in the development and wellbeing of such communities.  In sub-Saharan Africa, diseases transmitted by ticks and tsetse are important causes of mortality and morbidity in livestock; tsetse-borne trypanosomiasis has been estimated to cost Africa US$4.5 billion a year and East Coast Fever, transmitted by ticks, has been estimated at US$ 168 million.Historically, research and control of tick- and tsetse-borne diseases were under the auspices of somewhat distinct groups with control of the various diseases and vectors often the responsibility of separate veterinary and entomology departments.  Recently, however, control of tsetse- and tick-borne diseases is becoming increasingly integrated due to:-1. Privatisation and reduction of government veterinary and extension services, with animal health inputs devolving from the level of government agencies to that of individual farmers and livestock keepers.2. Increasing recognition of the need for integrated disease control rather than control of individual diseases; this applies to prevention, control, diagnosis and therapy wherein there are many potential synergies to be exploited through integration.3. Increasing awareness and availability of technologies that impinge on both types of disease, particularly pyrethroid insecticides that are effective against ticks and tsetse and, to some extent, genetically resistant cattle such as N\u00c2\u00bfdama.While it is apparent that integration is happening, there is scant information on the epidemiological, social and economic implications of this trend. And in particular, concern is attached to the impact that widespread use of pyrethroid-treated cattle may have on prevalence and severity of major tick-borne diseases, especially for poorer livestock-owning communities.The diseases and their vectors, past and present tick and tsetse control in Africa, epidemiological aspects of vector-borne diseases, future directions in tick and tsetse control in Africa and policy issues and information provision for integrated tsetse- and tick-borne disease control",

You will already have a firm appreciation of the intricacies of the immune systems and the many layers that can be deployed for the neutralisation of pathogens and yet pathogens are able to establish and survive.

Assess data requirements for quantifying their total societal impact and identify ways in which this data could be obtained.Analyse farm/herd level livestock economics, at the livestock output and gross  margin level.Explain the wider issues in animal health economics and the theoretical principles involved. Discuss how the economic impact of animal disease can be quantified.  Use herd models to explore how variations in livestock productivity parameters can be applied in order to assess the impact of disease on livestock and the extent to which interventions to control disease can mitigate this impact.Apply methods for assessing the impact of disease in human populations using DALYs and in terms of the financial cost to patients and health services of dealing with disease.Calculate the costs of disease control in human and animal populations.Use data on disease burden in people, losses in livestock and costs of intervening to control these diseases in cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses.

For many diseases the prospect of improved diagnostics capabilities in both laboratory and at point of care (POC) is fast becoming reality. Whilst the global burden and impact of non-communicable diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease is steadily increasing this course focuses on infectious diseases, both for diagnosis and for prognostication, and where relevant for directing treatment.Whilst these diagnostic advances provide the ideal One\u0002Health opportunity for students from both human and veterinary/animal health backgrounds to come together and consider these applications across their respective disciplines, the course opens by firstly considering the importance of diagnostics in global health and alsointroducing the range of diagnostics utilised. A point of care (POC) thread runs vertically throughout this course with both laboratory and POC applications for various platforms considered. The role of diagnostics in refining the use of antimicrobials across human and veterinary species is a key theme. Towards the end of the course consideration is paid to the area of biomarker discovery and other future perspectives relevant to the area of diagnostics.",

During the course a range of important disorders are covered including diabetes, obesity, lipid dysfunction, renal, liver, thyroid, adrenal and bone disorders.This course emphasises a problem solving approach integrating information from prior life history, behaviour, symptoms, signs to optimise biochemical testing and interpretation: a universal approach in healthcare and indeed in animal welfare and interpretation of models of disease. Healthcare approaches to populations is also dealt with in covering current approaches to the very common metabolic syndrome disorders (diabetes, obesity, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia) utilising evidence-based risk factors and testing to target resources and treatment where benefits of treatment are greatest. The wide perspective from molecules to populations is of considerable interest and provides valuable background to Honours programmes in Medical Sciences and Biomedical Sciences.",

The course draws upon evidence from several disciplines including sociology of health and illness, critical public health, and bioethics.",
    "course_description": "'Health, Illness and Society (HIS) introduces students to the social and wider determinants of health experience and outcome; lived experience of illness and disease, understood as shaped by multiple axes of social position and situated within social, cultural, political and environmental contexts, and ethics (public health and ethics relating to medical and social care).This is a social scientific course, which draws upon both qualitative and quantitative evidence and is structured into three substantive sections: 'Understanding Health Inequalities' comes first, running from weeks 1-4 incl. This is followed by 'Experiences of health and illness', covered in weeks 5-8 incl. Finally, 'Global and Planetary health' will be the focus of the final weeks. Taken as a whole, the course will introduce students to:- The social and wider determinants of health which shape patterns of health inequalities in the population.- The many and varied factors that shape experiences of illness.- Key ethical principles, and how these relate to clinical care, population health and \u00c2\u00bfhuman flourishing\u00c2\u00bf.In the initial weeks of the course, you will be introduced to health inequalities and the various frameworks used for understanding these disparities in health experiences and outcomes.  The course goes on to explore experiences of health and illness, covering topics such as chronic illness and disability, the doctor-patient interaction and experiences of diagnosis. Finally, we will turn to consider global and planetary health, focusing on questions of health that concern us all, as interconnected in the global world. Throughout the course, resources will be used that offer examples from both the UK and globally.Lectures and tutorials will introduce students to different forms of evidence and regular guest speakers will offer first-hand insights into the applicability and relevance of 'structural competency' to their work as frontline health professionals, policymakers, academic researchers, and activists.",

    "course_description": "Over the course of your studies you have acquired detailed knowledge in many areas of the Medical Sciences. In addition, you should have acquired or further developed a number of skills that allow you to research new information, critically analyse it and interpret it.An important component of this analytical process is reflection - The ability to re-evaluate in light of new information.The Academic Portfolio is an opportunity to revisit a theme addressed at an earlier stage of your studies and re-evaluate it in the context of three areas:\u00c2\u00bf\tNew knowledge;\u00c2\u00bf\tNew skills;\u00c2\u00bf\tCritical analysis and interpretation.Reflection might be phrased as \u00c2\u00bfwhat do I know now that I didn\u00c2\u00bft know then?\u00c2\u00bf and \u00c2\u00bfwhat can I do now (or do better) that I couldn\u00c2\u00bft do then?\u00c2\u00bf Answers to these questions in the context of your portfolio theme should allow you to take the theme to a higher intellectual level, in a new direction and hopefully both. As such the portfolio can involve,\u00c2\u00bf\tupdating the specific subject area chosen\u00c2\u00bf\ttaking the opportunity to develop it in new directions not within the remit of the original piece of work.The development of reflective and re-evaluative skills is at the core of the Medical Sciences Programme and essential to the overall intellectual development of a modern day Medical Scientist.",

We also highlight current controversies and challenges for the 21st Century in Neuroscience, partly by asking teachers and experienced researchers to speak about their subject area then leading students through specific aspects of the topic. The aim is to encourage critical thinking and evaluation of evidence, crucial to the development of a neuroscientist. These skills are also of practical value in dealing with material on the Elective Courses and students' independent research towards their Dissertation.",

The results of the research will be formally presented to the whole class and teachers, and also written up as a Dissertation which is independently marked by at least two members of the Board of Examiners.  Library project students have a relatively free choice of topic subject to approval by the Board of Examiners, but guidance on a choice of topic will be given to those who require it.  The choice of laboratory-based projects will be limited and admission is competitive.  Acceptance onto a laboratory-based project may depend on a student's academic record and on consideration of evidence of future plans for a career in laboratory-based science or medicine.  However, both library-based and laboratory-based projects are considered of equal value: both provide ample opportunities for students to demonstrate their creative, critical and analytical skills.",

The themes covered may change from year to year, but examples of current topics include:Neural development, Neurodegeneration and regeneration; Cellular and synaptic neurophysiology; Sensory and control systems, Motor disorders, Cognitive neurology; Neuroinformatics. In the themed weeks indicated above, students will be familiarized with the breadth of neuroscience research being undertaken at the University of Edinburgh, and will be taught the basic principles and and current approaches and findings in different disciplines within neuroscience research.The course is assessed via two in-course assessments. ICA1 - a group poster presentation and ICA2, an individual news and views essay and a lay summary.Students will be allocated to groups at the outset of the course  and a list of papers related to topics in themed weeks, early in the programme,  provided.  To help prepare students for ICA1, there will be a session in which the task is introduced and  an interactive discussion on what makes a good poster. Formative feedback will be provided on a draft poster for each group, in advance of the final assessed poster submission and presentation.To help prepare students for ICA2, there will be one session to introduce the task and discuss the target audience, aims and structure of a scientific news and views essay and a lay summary, using examples. There will be a second session in which students will work in small groups to produce an outline of a news and views article and lay summary of a scientific paper related to themed weeks. In the second half of the workshop, the ideas generated by the different groups will be discussed by the whole class and brought together. This session will serve as formative feedback in advance of submission of the individual assessed news and views article and lay summary.",

These neurodevelopmental disorders may be associated with features such as epilepsy, sensory hyper- and hypo-sensitivity, and altered social interaction and/or cognition. Many neurodevelopmental disorders have a genetic basis, which allows a direct path to understand behaviour and potential therapy of these deleterious features. This elective course showcases research being undertaken at the University of Edinburgh which hopes to give an insight how changes to genes leads to altered synaptic, cellular, circuit, and behavioural function in neurodevelopmental disorders.Course deliverySeminars will be delivered by the course team which includes researchers in the field of neurodevelopment who are using cutting edge techniques to understand neurodevelopmental disorders and potential therapies. The seminar sessions will consist of 1-2 weekly seminars from researchers in the field.These seminars will be complemented by oral presentations from the students, to be based on published literature related to topics presented in the previous seminar sessions.

The themes covered may change from year to year, but examples of current topics include:Neural development, Neurodegeneration and regeneration; Cellular and synaptic neurophysiology; Sensory and control systems, Motor disorders, Cognitive neurology; Neuroinformatics. In the themed weeks indicated above, students will be familiarized with the breadth of neuroscience research being undertaken at the University of Edinburgh, and will be taught the basic principles and and current approaches and findings in different disciplines within neuroscience research.The course is assessed via two in-course assessments. ICA1 - a group poster and ICA2, an individual news and views essay and a lay summary.Students will be allocated to groups and assigned papers related to the first few themed weeks at the outset of the course.  To help prepare students for ICA1, there will be a session in which the task is introduced and  an interactive discussion on what makes a good poster. Formative feedback will be provided on a draft poster for each group, in advance of the final assessed poster submission and display.To help prepare students for ICA2, there will be a workshop to introduce the task and discuss the target audience, aims and structure of a scientific news and views essay and a lay summary.  Then the students will work through one or more examples of news and views articles and lay summaries, critically appraising them using the marking criteria and feedback forms, and discuss their feedback together as a class.  This session will serve as formative feedback in advance of submission of the individual assessed news and views article and lay summary.",

    "course_description": "Pharmacology is the study of the actions of drugs in the body (pharmacodynamics), and of the quantitative aspects of drug action (pharmacokinetics). The course will provide insight into how drugs produce their effects in the body when treating diseases and alleviating suffering. Most drugs are organic chemicals which interact with the body's physiological and biochemical processes. Consequently, it is necessary to learn a sufficient amount about these processes during the course in order to understand the actions of drugs and how their potencies are quantified. The course will provide opportunities to explore how drugs produce their effects at the systems, cellular and molecular levels. In the course we will consider the targets for the actions of drugs in the body and how the structure and function of receptors and ion channels relates to drug action. We will also investigate intracellular processes within cells and their modification by drugs.Many drugs have chemical structures which are related to the structures of natural substances, found in the body and in other parts of the natural world. Modifications made to these structures can make more specific drugs and/or drugs with longer duration of actions. Some examples of suchchanges in chemical structure will be discussed. Also, the biosynthesis of several natural substances including neurotransmitters and hormones will be outlined. In order to assess the relative potencies of different drugs, it is necessary to have a quantitative measure of drug activity. Opportunities will be provided to gain experience in performing pharmacological-type experiments, gaining familiarity with, and respect for, the use of animal tissues in vitro to analyse drug action, and how quantitative data can be processed into meaningful results and appropriate conclusions.We will evaluate the physical properties of drugs that are important for their effects and develop understanding of the quantification of drug action alongside understanding of the factors controlling the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs by the body. This knowledge will be applied to the clinical usefulness of drugs and the unwanted effects associated with drug usage.",

Senior expert researchers will also provide lectures covering cutting-edge research in their field of pharmacology/therapeutics. The course will also provide a coherent perspective of how drugs are developed from a molecular target through preclinical development to clinical trials. It will consider how academic pharmacology can interact with drug development or can be focussed on discovery of molecular mechanisms independent of immediate therapeutic potential. Key aspects of the drug discovery pipeline in the industrial and academic domains will be considered. There will be opportunity to meet with Programme tutors in small groups.

Analysis-based projects offer an excellent opportunity to carry out an in-depth review of the current research status of a topical field of interest and its future prospects for development - especially suitable for those students who have already decided that their future career will not be based in experimental pharmacology.  A laboratory-based project enables a student to gain insight into the pleasures, difficulties, and complexity associated with Pharmacological research - this experience will be of considerable benefit for any future career but especially for one in laboratory-based research.  Group projects emphasize team-work.  The project dissertation will showcase and allow for the assessment of your ability to review current literature, present methods and results, discuss findings and make proposals for further studies clearly and concisely, with appropriate statistical analysis to support your conclusions.Oral presentations will further develop your oral communication skills, thereby enhancing your ability to answer, and to ask, critical questions. This transferable skill will be of considerable value in your future employment.",

With support from an academic tutor, the Student-Led Individually Created Course (SLICC) framework gives you autonomy and ownership to enable you to develop a reflective e-portofolio of your learning, focussing on your project. The course will capture what sort of project you want to undertake during Reproductive Biology, what skills you want to achieve, and why, then enable you develop your understanding of your field of study in a project proposal, and to reflect upon the attainment of all your learning gains.  In the final reflective report you will develop skills and insight to articulate all your learning associated with your project, and how this will be useful to you in achieving your future aspirations.",
    "course_description": "This course offers you a learning framework to reflect on your acquisition of academic, professional and personal skills when choosing, planning for, and during your Honours Project.  With tutor support, the Student-Led Individually Created Course (SLICC) framework gives you autonomy and ownership.  It requires you to frequently use a blog, and to collect and curate evidence of your learning as a reflective e-portofolio, focussed on your project.  Your portfolio will capture what sort of project you want to undertake during Reproductive Biology, what skills you want to achieve, and why. It will then enable you to reflect upon the attainment of all your learning gains during the project.  By the end, in the 'Final Reflective Report', you will have developed skills and insight to articulate all your learning experiences, and how this will be useful to you in achieving your future aspirations.With the guidance and support of an academic tutor you will consider the wide spectrum of academic, professional, and personal aims you will gain throughout your project experience.  You will use these to define your own learning outcomes in a reflective 'Reflective Learning Proposal', submitted in semester 1.  You will look forward to your project to examine the development of the 'Graduate Attributes' you will need and aim to acquire. Early in semester 2, you will write a 'Project Proposal', which forms 50% of the summative assessment, which will enable you to begin to understand the complexities of your project work, the academic field of study in which it lies, and to gain insight into asking a scientific question in this context, whilst developing your scientific writing skills.  You will receive formative feedback when writing this from your project supervisor.  You will reflect and draw on your experiences midway into your project, to write your formative 'Interim Reflective Report', using evidence collected in your e-portfolio, for instance formative feedback and your reflective blog.  This is in the same format as  your 'Final Reflective Report' submitted at the end enabling you to articulate all the learning associated with your project.  An important element of this is to reflect on how successfully you have achieved your learning outcomes, and provide a self-assessment.  The 'Final Reflective Report' forms the other 50% of the summative assessment.",
