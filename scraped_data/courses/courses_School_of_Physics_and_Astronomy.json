    "summary": "This course covers the field theoretical treatment of the standard model of particle physics. It consists of twothreads taught in parallel. The primary focus of the Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and QuantumChromodynamics (QCD) thread is perturbative QCD in collider physics, but it starts with QED renormalisation,building on the material taught in Quantum Field Theory (QFT). The other thread covers electroweak theoryand flavour physics.",
    "course_description": "This course provides a comprehensive treatment of the field theoretical approach to the Standard Model ofparticle physics; it is taught in two parallel threads.The QED and QCD thread begins with path integral quantisation and renormalisation of QuantumElectrodynamics (QED). It then moves on to a detailed study of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), beginningwith quantisation, Feynman rules and renormalisation, and then applying a wide range of topics in modernperturbative QCD to collider physics, including deep inelastic scattering and Higgs production.The electroweak physics thread focuses on the field theoretical construction and application of the standardmodel of particle physics, including parity violation, spontaneously broken gauge theories, mass generationthrough the Higgs mechanism, the flavour sector of the SM, quark mixing, and CP violation. Further focus is ondetailed calculations in perturbation theory and comparison with experiment.Each thread will have two hours of lectures and two hours of tutorial workshops every week, giving a total of 40 lecture hours and 40 tutorial hours. Students are expected to engage with the material presented in lectures by working through and discussing weekly formative problem sheets in the tutorial sessions. There will be a total of 4 summative hand-ins, which will be marked and individual written will be feedback provided on each. Individual feedback will also be administered verbally during tutorial sessions.",

What responsibilities do astrobiologists have during the search for extraterrestrial life and when claiming the discovery is made? Furthermore, what role should the humanities and social sciences play as our species extends its reach into space? To explore such questions, students on this course will examine the philosophical, cultural, ethical and social issues orbiting astrobiology and space exploration.",

Scientists on the course will learn about the key theories and methods in science & technology studies (STS) as applied to astrobiology, and develop the skills and confidence to contribute productively to broader discussions of their research and its social dimensions. Social scientists on the course will have the opportunity to explore these exciting areas of scientific enquiry in depth, and to apply theory and methods from their disciplinary training to the analysis of these fields. Both groups will gain a new appreciation for interdisciplinary dialogue and debate.Topics explored on this course will include:the history of astrobiology,the Drake equation,the epistemology of extraordinary claims,depictions of astrobiology and space exploration in science fiction media and popular cultureplanetary law and politics,equality, diversity and inclusion in astrobiology and work in spaceenvironmental ethics and planetary protectionthe ethics of space explorationThe course will be delivered through a weekly seminar.

    "course_description": "Section 1: The Tools of the TradeThis introductory section explores what Physics is and reviews the key tools (mental, not metal) needed in the practice of Physics.1.1 The trade: what is Physics?1.2 Units1.3 Numbers1.4 Vectors1.5 Problem solvingSection 2: Space and TimePhysics deals with the sequence of events that make up the unfolding story of the universe. The most basic questions we can ask about 'events' are 'where?' and 'when?' Thus Space and Time are the key concepts of physics. In this section we explore the classical view of Space and Time developed by Galileo and Newton, and touch on its failures, unearthed by Einstein.2.1 One dimensional particle kinematics2.2 Kinematics in two (or three) dimensions2.3 Application: projectile motion2.4 Application: circular motion2.5 Relativity: the common sense view2.6 Relativity: Einstein's viewSection 3: Force Mass and MotionUnderstanding a changing world means understanding motion. This section is concerned with the key concepts (mass, force) underlying the classical Newtonian theory of motion, and expressed in Newton's three laws. We illustrate the application of these laws in the context of a wide range of forces, and touch on some of the curious 'forces' encountered in 'accelerating' reference frames.3.1 Inertial reference frames: Newton's 1st Law3.2 Force and mass: Newton's 2nd and 3rd laws3.3 How to use Newton's Laws3.4 Classification of forces3.5 Gravitational force near the earth's surface3.6 Normal contact force3.7 Tension3.8 Frictional force3.9 Linear restoring force3.10 The centripetal force3.11 The gravitational force3.12 The electrostatic force3.13 Fictitious forcesSection 4: Energy and WorkTo describe the changing world around us, we must describe its state. Energy is one of the key tools that allow us to do this. In this section we explore the concept of energy: its definition, its conservation and its utility in problem solving.4.1 Introduction4.2 Work4.3 Power: the rate of working4.4 Kinetic energy4.5 Potential energy4.6 Potential energy: examples4.7 Energy conservationSection 5: Linear MomentumThe concept of the linear momentum of a system of particles is an extremely fruitful one in many areas of physics. In this section we develop the tools needed to describe the motion of such a system, and deduce that momentum must be conserved for an isolated system. This allows us to analyse elastic and inelastic collisions. We will also look at what happens to our view of mass, momentum and energy for objects moving at very high speeds.5.1 Preview5.2 Systems of particles5.3 Motion of the centre of mass5.4 Linear momentum5.5 Linear momentum and its conservation5.6 Collisions5.7 Relativity: Mass, Momentum and EnergySection 6: Angular MomentumIn this section we develop concise methods of describing rotational motion using quantities such as angular velocity, angular momentum and moment of inertia, the rotational analogues of velocity, momentum and mass. Using this new language, we can describe such counterintuitive phenomena as the behaviour of spinning tops and gyroscopes, and find out why it is easier to ride a bicycle with bigger wheels.6.1 Linear and rotational motion6.2 Angular positions, velocities and accelerations6.3 Relations between angular and linear quantities6.4 Constant acceleration equations6.5 Kinetic energy of a rotating body: moment of inertia6.6 Torque6.7 Angular momentum6.8 Angular momentum conservationSection 7: OscillationsUnderstanding and exploiting oscillations is central to many aspects of science including physics, chemistry, biology and engineering. In this section we will set out the key concepts, and explore them in the context of a wide range of examples. We shall end up in chaos.7.1 Introduction: what and why7.2 Simple Harmonic Motion: the physical context7.3 The SHM equation: a general tour7.4 The SHM equation: applications7.5 Energy conservation in SHM7.6 Driving and damping7.7 Chaos",

The 5 practical workshops will have an assignment to be completed as a group project in-class and turned in at the end of the period.  The 4 tutorial sessions will provide help sessions on the hand-in assignment for the week. The final tutorial week serves as a review session.  This scheme is identical to Discovering Astronomy.Attributes and Skills:  Students will develop critical analysis skills through a critical examination of the evidence for the standard cosmological paradigm (SQCF learning outcome 3). They will develop modest numeracy skills via the workshops and assignments which will typically involve solving problems using maths and/or guided web-based applications (SQCF learning outcome 4).  They will develop group working skills through the workshop projects which are typically done in groups of 3-5 people (SQCF learning outcome 5).",

    "summary": "This two-semestered course covers fundamentals of quantum mechanics and its applications to atomic and molecular systems.The first semester covers non-relativistic quantum mechanics, supplying the basic concepts and tools needed to understand the physics of atoms, molecules, and the solid state. One-dimensional wave mechanics is reviewed. The postulates and calculational rules of quantum mechanics are introduced, including Dirac notation. Angular momentum and spin are shown to be quantized, and the corresponding wave-function symmetries are discussed. The Schrodinger equation is solved for a number of important cases, including the harmonic oscillator and the Hydrogen atom.  The fundamentals of time independent perturbation theory will be introduced as a means of approximating solutions to complex problems.The second semester deals principally with atomic structure, the interaction between atoms and fields, and the atom- atom interactions in molecular physics. The course presents a detailed treatment of the hydrogen atom, including spin-orbit coupling, the fine structure, and the hyperfine interactions. Identical particles are reviewed in the context of electron electron interactions; applications include the Helium atom, Coulomb/exchange integrals, and alkali metals energy levels. Atom-field interactions are discussed, leading to dipole transitions, the Zeeman effect, the Lande g-factor, and the Stark effect. Finally atom-atom interactions are presented, leading to the study of molecular binding, molecular degrees of freedom (electronic, vibrational, and rotational), elementary group theory considerations and molecular spectroscopy.",

These skills are key foundations for project work later in the degree programme and valuable in life beyond undergraduate study, for example in research, industry or government.",
    "course_description": "This course serves as an introduction to physics research, both hot topics in contemporary physics and practice in the skills that are relevant to performing research. In Semester 1, students will choose a topic to focus on over the year, each topic being based on a single 'key' paper that has appeared in a leading research journal and describes cutting-edge science. Students will complete three individually written 'warm-up' exercises related to this key paper: 1) annotated bibliography, 2) POSTnote and 3) referee report. To help students with the technical content of their key paper and the task briefs for the exercises, there is a specialist advisor on hand for each topic.In Semester 2, students will apply the skills acquired in Semester 1 in a group project that sets out the general background for their topic, looks in detail at a recent scientific advance and sets out exciting new questions for the future. This final project will pull together the resources that students have collected in the bibliography exercise, ideas for context from the POSTnote and insights from their careful reading of the key research paper to write the referee report.",

Taken together, these two courses should provide students with a solid, balanced, physics-based understanding of the structure of our Universe, and our place within space and time.The course introduces the fundamental concepts of modern cosmology. The meaning of time and space in an expanding universe are discussed, and the dynamics of the expansion, starting from a hot Big Bang. Observational evidence includes the abundance of light elements, the microwave background, and large-scale structure. The initial conditions for the expansion require careful tuning, leading to the theory of inflation. The standard model of cosmology is introduced and elements such as dark matter and dark energy are explained.Syllabus:* History and basic concepts* The Robertson-Walker metric* Light propagation and redshifts* Dynamics of the Universe* Observational cosmology; distances and ages in the Univese* The distance ladder* Thermal history of the Universe.

    "summary": "This is a two-semester course on the classical interactions of light and matter (electromagnetism), and the relationship between space and time (special relativity). The focus of the course will similarly be twofold; there will be emphasis on developing skills to solve physical problems, and on the close interplay between mathematical results and physical laws.",
    "course_description": "40 lectures across 2 semesters.The course assumes a good working knowledge of second year vector calculus material (vectors, tensors, integral theorems, div grad curl, curvilinear coordinates). The course will take you from the application of this material to electrostatic and magnetostatic problems, through dynamical problems of electromagnetism in vacuum and in media. The similarities, rather than the differences, between electric and magnetic phenomena will be emphasised throughout, leading to the introduction of special relativity and the physics of e.g. time dilation, length contraction, and frame (in)dependence. The implications of this new understanding of space and time will be discussed in the context of electromagnetism, exploring the unification of electric and magnetic phenomena. The course will take you to the point where you are ready to tackle the manifestly Lorentz covariant formulation of electrodynamics in fourth year.",

We discuss the general properties of such functions, and develop the machinery of their differential and integral calculus. A special emphasis is placed on using the Residue Theorem to evaluate real integrals. We introduce the Fourier and Laplace transforms and demonstrate how they can be used in solving linear PDEs.The other half of the course, Vectors, Tensors, and Continuum Mechanics, provides an introduction to Cartesian tensors, rotation and reflection symmetries, and the basics of the underlying group structures. These concepts are then applied to continuum mechanics, using tensor arguments to formulate and explore \u00c2\u00bflinear elasticity\u00c2\u00bf, the theory of elastic bodies and their deformations, in terms of strain and stress tensors.",

It is not available to students in Integrated Masters year.",
    "course_description": "The course entails:- Classroom observation and assistance: Initial contact with the teacher and pupils will be as a classroom assistant, watching how the teacher handles the class, the lesson structure, the level of science taught and offering practical support to the teacher in the 'lab'.- Teaching assistance: The teacher will assign the undergraduate actual teaching tasks which will vary depending on specific needs and the undergraduate's own ability as it develops over the term.  This could include offering problem-solving coaching to a small group of higher ability pupils or taking the last ten minutes of the lesson for the whole class.  As part of their course assessment the undergraduate will have to demonstrate an understanding of how the level of scientific knowledge of the pupils they are teaching fits in to their overall learning context in other subjects.- Special projects: The undergraduate will devise a special project on the basis of discussion with the teacher and their own assessment of what will interest the particular pupils they are working with.  The undergraduate will have to show that they can analyse a specific teaching problem and devise and prepare appropriately targeted teaching materials, practical demonstrations and basic 'tests'.- Extra-curricula projects: The undergraduate may be supervised by the teacher in helping to run an out-of-timetable activity such as a lunchtime science club, special coaching periods for higher ability pupils or a trip to their university department.  The undergraduate will have to demonstrate an ability to think laterally in order to formulate interesting ways to illustrate more difficult scientific concepts.",

The Hilbert space of physical states is reviewed as a particular case of a linear vector space. General properties of representation theory are discussed for the case of finite groups and are applied to quantum mechanical systems. Representations of the continuous groups U(1), SO(3), and SU(2) are presented and discussed in relation with invariance under translations and rotations. The general theory of angular momentum is introduced and applied to cases of physical interest. Quantum mechanical results are compared to their classical counterparts for a number of physical systems.",

This course will introduce the students to the basics of biological systems, and then provide examples of how familiar physical principles (thermodynamics, statistical mechanics) underlie complex biological phenomena.This course will introduce you to the wonders of biology: the organisms, cells, and molecules that make up the living world. We will demonstrate the power of physical concepts to understand and make powerful predictions about biological systems, from the folding of a protein into a unique three-dimensional structure within a reasonable timeframe, through the motions of proteins to drive biological processes, to the locomotion of bacterial cells. The physical concepts will be substantially familiar, but their applications will be novel. Where possible, examples will be drawn from the recent scientific literature.",

    "course_description": "The course teaches students:- how to formulate the equations relevant for hydrodynamics in conservative and non-conservative form.- how to discretise the equations relevant for hydrodynamics in conservative form.- how to numerically implement as computer code a subset of the equations relevant for hydrodynamics.- knowledge of concepts of source terms, Eulerian and Lagrangian formulations, implicit and explicit formulations, finite difference approximations, finite difference/volume/element methods.- the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) implementation of the hydrodynamics equations.- an understanding of the situations in which a Lagrangian treatment (as used by SPH) may be more appropriate than a Eulerian treatment.- the Particle-Mesh method of solving the Poisson equation. This includes the ability to express the equations for gravitational dynamics in Fourier space, a sufficient awareness of a representative code to alter the initial conditions appropriately, understand the output, check the accuracy of the results, and manipulate and display them using standard tools.- how to numerically implement as computer code a subset of the equations relevant for Particle-Mesh simulations.- properties of the Discrete Fourier Transform.",

Such conditions also occur during explosions and impacts, and in nuclear energy systems.  In addition, the limits of the survival of life at extreme conditions, such as, in the deep oceans and on other worlds, remains of central interest.This course covers the nature of high-pressure and high-temperature phenomena and their origin in basic physical principles, and focuses on how new physics emerges at extreme conditions, such as under very high pressure, very high or low temperature, and at high atomic density.The course combines principles from thermodynamics, condensed matter physics, plasma physics, astrophysics, and mechanics to understand how pressure and temperature generate unusual states of matter, crystallize exotic structures, form shock waves, produce energy via nuclear fusion, and lead to exotic requirements for life (in a microbiological context).PoEE will discuss the transformation of simple materials subjected to extreme conditions, high-pressure crystal structures, the nature of molecules at high density, plasmas and electronic transformations, and conditions for life under extremes.",

It introduces the Lagrangian formulation for classical fields and then discusses the canonical quantisation of free fields with spins 0, 1/2 and 1. An outline is given of perturbation theory for interacting fields and Feynman diagram methods for Quantum Electrodynamics are introduced. The course also introduces path integral methods in quantum field theory. This gives a better understanding of the quantisation of gauge theories and forms an essential tool for the understanding and development of the 'standard model' of particle physics. Topics include: Path integral formalism, Feynman rules, LSZ formalism, loop diagrams and regularisation and renormalization of divergencies.",

    "course_description": "This course examines the radiation processes on-going in astrophysical objects: both continuum processes and emission line processes. The course begins by examining the many physical processes which are important in the structure and emission of light from extreme astrophysical sources, such as supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei, radio jets, and clusters of galaxies, which involve extreme conditions, like high energies, temperatures, or densities. Starting from Maxwell's equations, the classical theory of radiation from an accelerated charge is developed, and generalised to the relativistic case. Topics studied then include: synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons gyrating in a magnetic field; the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies; Compton and inverse Compton scattering; accretion of material onto compact objects; Radio galaxies and quasars, and their jets; bremsstrahlung emission from hot gas; cooling flows and the role of black holes in galaxy formation. The course then considers the physics of radiation and its quantal interaction with matter, and studies this interaction in various astrophysical environments to define the nature and limitations of observation. These techniques are applied to several important and characteristic astronomical observations, such as the 21cm radiation of atomic hydrogen used to weigh galaxies, the carbon monoxide emission used to map star nurseries, and the hydrogen Lyman alpha line forest used to determine the distribution of galaxy-forming matter throughout the Universe.",

    "summary": "An introduction to scientific image analysis i.e. the extraction of quantitative information from scientific images. Both general principles and practical implementation will be covered, including machine-learning approaches. Examples will be drawn from scientific research, but relevance to applications beyond academia will also be covered. The course will also cover examples of scientific imaging techniques, as understanding contrast mechanisms is crucial when interpreting results from image analysis. Both an open-source application (e.g. ImageJ) and a contemporary programming language (e.g. Python) will be used as image-analysis tools, as both tools are widely used for preliminary and batch-processed image analysis.The course starts with a description of images, image properties, and images as numerical arrays. Image acquisition, contrast mechanisms, and image artefacts will be covered. Several techniques for extracting quantitative information from images will be considered, including machine-learning approaches. Examples of applying image analysis to solving problems in physics and astronomy research, and beyond, will be presented.",
    "course_description": "Image analysis involves the extraction of quantitative information from images, image sequences or videos; these days the images are usually digital. It is used in academic research, industry e.g. quality control in manufacturing processes, and medical research e.g. analyzing X-ray CT images. Within the School, it is used in Astronomy, (Soft) Condensed Matter and Particle Physics. Hence, it is a skill that is regularly encountered in both undergraduate and postgraduate (research) projects. Overall, it is a skill that may well be useful to any graduate, whether planning a career within or outwith academia.Images are typically easy to record (e.g. with a mobile phone) but non-trivial to analyze. In this course, you will learn about scientific images and how to quantitatively analyze them, for example by writing a computer program in such a way that it reliably distinguishes the objects of interest from the background. This may sound trivial, but low signal-to-noise, motion blurring, non-uniform illumination, loss of contrast, etc can make it challenging to extract the desired information from the image. You will also consider image acquisition and how it may affect image analysis, as good image analysis starts with at least a basic understanding of the imaging method. This is because all imaging methods are prone to artefacts, which can lead to misunderstanding; you are more likely to identify artefacts if you understand the imaging method. Moreover, in many cases, the best way to improve quantitative analysis of images is to record higher-quality images.This course has a substantial hands-on component i.e. a substantial amount of time is spent on directed independent learning, supported by sessions and drop-in classes. Both ImageJ and Python will be used as image-analysis tools, as both tools are widely used for preliminary (ImageJ) and batch-processed (Python) image analysis. The lectures will mainly focus on general principles, for example thresholding considerations and errors introduced by thresholding. The course also covers topics beyond coding, including the physics of image contrast generation. The course is rooted in the application of image analysis to physics and astronomy research; examples could include: extracting particle size from microscopy images for scientific research and industrial quality control, quantitative analysis of 3D X-ray CT scans for materials characterization and medical applications, and extracting information from data where image quality may be affected by clouds and/or lighting, for example in astronomy and satellite data. Notably, these examples build on each other and are chosen to demonstrate the wide applicability of scientific image analysis, not because techniques are mutually exclusive. For example, image segmentation may be introduced in analyzing electron microscopy images, but it is also ubiquitous in analyzing images in medical applications and astronomy.Topics typically covered in this course are:-\tImages, image properties, images as numerical arrays, version control.-\tImage acquisition, contrast mechanisms, sample preparation, image artefacts.-\tImage processing, filtering, enhancement, Fast Fourier Transforms.-\tSegmentation, morphological operations, measurements and errors, image analysis without thresholding.-\tImage sequences, time and memory considerations, machine-learning approaches, training considerations.-\tApplications of image analysis in scientific research and beyond.The course will be taught through a combination of lectures, lab sessions, and drop-in classes. The lectures only run in the first half of the course, to allow more time to be dedicated to the main assignment in the second half. Lab sessions and drop-in classes run throughout the semester. A substantial part of learning will consist of directed independent learning. Coding skills are assessed through checkpoints, self-reflection is assessed through feedback statements. The main assignment consists of a short pitch to non-experts to explain your approach, followed by a report aimed at your peers, which together assesses coding, communication, understanding and application to (physics) problems.",

    "summary": "This is a course on the statistical physics of interacting particles. We  begin by reviewing the fundamental assumptions of equilibrium statistical mechanics focussing on the relation between missing information (or entropy) and probability.  We then consider the statistical mechanics of interacting particles and develop important approximation schemes.  This leads us to review  phase transitions and the unifying phenomenology. We study in detail a simple, microscopic model for phase transitions: the Ising model.  We then consider a general theoretical framework known asLandau Theory.  Finally we discuss the issue of dynamics: how does a system approach and explore the state of thermal equilibrium? How does one reconcile microscopic time reversibility with the macroscopic arrow of time?",
