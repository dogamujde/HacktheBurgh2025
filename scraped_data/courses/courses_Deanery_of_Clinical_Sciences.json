The course will explore invasive and non-invasive respiratory support, pharmacological and mechanical cardiovascular support and renal replacement therapy. There will be a focus on advanced imaging techniques including the use of ultrasound and echocardiography in critical care.2) Outline ContentAt the start this course the students will be re-orientated to the online virtual intensive care ward. This ward will be populated by a selection of patients similar the group they had referred to critical care in the Fundamentals course and cared for in the Core Clinical course. A virtual walk round will allow them to concentrate on specific aspects of advanced organ support. They will learn about non-invasive ventilatory support. They will explore strategies for ventilation and oxygenation in the patient with severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure who require combinations of volume control, pressure control, inverse ratio ventilation, and prone ventilation. The criteria for referral for Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation will be discussed. They will explore the causes of shock, detailed pathophysiology of cardiac and peripheral vascular failure, and monitoring and imaging the heart including cardiac output measurement. The place of inotropes, vasopressors and mechanical circulatory support in shock will be surfaced by critically reviewing the pertinent literature. The course will include detailed consideration of renal replacement therapy; different modalities for different contexts; physical access; anticoagulation; acid-base and electrolyte balance; fluid balance. The students will also consider how to integrate these various modes of support in the care of a patient in established multiple organ failure. The place of ultrasound and focussed echocardiography in the assessment and management of patients with organ failure will be explored.3) Student Learning ExperienceStudents will learn from subject matter experts in critical care through the medium of a virtual intensive care unit. The virtual ward round will expose them to a selection of patients whose clinical situation will foreground specific aspects of advanced organ support. Students will participate in asynchronous subject matter expert-led discussion boards, where they will each develop a daily assessment and reasoned management plan for their allocated patient. They will reflect on their role and the interactions of the critical care team. Classic papers will be reviewed.  The students will develop an allocated topic for presentation at the weekly live tutorials. There will be weekly online clinical quizzes. The students will also engage with recorded lectures and videos featuring key practical procedures with demonstrations of organ support modalities and imaging in action.

The initial assessment and immediate management of patients with respiratory failure, shock, coma and acute kidney injury will be expounded. The principles of effective patient referral to critical care will be surfaced, and the practicalities of excellent patient handover will be demonstrated. There will be discussion of the application of realistic decision-making involving end of life care, and the ethical issues involved.3) Student Learning ExperienceStudents will learn from subject matter experts in resuscitation and critical care. Students will participate in asynchronous subject matter expert-led discussion boards, where they will each bring an authentic case from clinical practice. These cases will be revisited in weekly live tutorials, and developed through the board discussions. The cases will form the focus of the development of their assessed structured referral and handover to critical care at the end of the course. There will be weekly online quizzes and the students will also engage with recorded tutorials and lectures. Classic papers will be reviewed.

There is an emerging recognition of the importance of non-technical elements in the provision of safe and high-quality healthcare. In this course the individual components of human factors are surfaced and the factors which influence them, in the context of critical care, are explored.",
    "course_description": "1) Academic DescriptionHuman Factors can be viewed from several perspectives: scientific and ergonomic; clinical; humane. This course will allow the student to learn about, and reflect on, team working,communication, prioritisation and planning, situation awareness and the implications of human factors science in Critical Care. Since decision making is such a ubiquitous and crucial component of the praxis of medicine emphasis will be given to learning more about this. It is complex, and multifaceted, and to understand it is to think about how we think, and what affects thinking. In order to make many clinical decisions in critical care we need understanding and knowledge of the predicted course of disease processes (diagnoses), including the effects of treatment, the effects of multiple morbidities, and the prognosis of acute illness. This course will signpost the need to consider the context of the decision making: from a patient or clinical team viewpoint, and from the perspective of time and place. Since the effects of affect may not be apparent or acknowledged, yet may be hugely important, a significant focus of learning will be around this. The importance of self-awareness in the caring human factors of empathy and compassion will be promoted.2)\tOutline contentSeveral integral elements of Human Factors, and the complex interplay between them, will be explored throughout this course.  Each week will introduce a new constituent of Human Factors, to help progress and deepen the students understanding.  The student will be introduced to a framework for which they can approach, and analyse, complex healthcare systems within critical care.  How the patient is triangulated through the interaction of these elements will be realised.  The issue of error, error reporting, and learning from error will be explored.  There will be specific emphasis on a sub category of Human Factors known as Â¿non-technical skillsÂ¿. With a particular focus on decision making models, dual process theory, and the place of cognitive, affective and contextual bias.  The evidence base for these will be reviewed.  A final focus will be on how to optimally utilise this acquired knowledge to improve healthcare systems.3)\tStudent Learning ExperienceStudents will learn from subject matter experts in clinical decision making, team working and communication.  A guided walk round the virtual ICU will allow the student to explore the geography and ergonomics and to examine issues of equipment and monitoring.  There will be discussion on their local approach to admitting, accepting and reporting mistakes, errors and critical incidents. Classic papers will be reviewed.  Along with pre-recorded and live tutorials, students will participate in expert-led discussion boards designed to explore understanding of the different Human Factors concepts.  Collectively, these will all assist in building a reflective essay.",

    "summary": "This course provides a thorough grounding in the area of sepsis. Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis and septic shock are major healthcare problems, affecting millions of people around the world each year, and killing as many as one in four (and often more). Early identification and appropriate management in the initial hours after sepsis develops improves patient outcomes. Sepsis results in a requirement for critical care due to shock, respiratory failure and, in many cases, multiple organ failure. The course will also highlight the importance of healthcare associated infection surveillance and prevention of infection in Critical Care.",
    "course_description": "1) Academic DescriptionSepsis usually originates from a localised infection which progresses into an uncontrolled systemic response. It can rapidly lead to acute physiological deterioration with the risk of multiple organ failure and death. In light of this the course will build on the early identification and management of sepsis which was discussed in the Core Clinical Course and introduce elements of more advanced therapy. Detailed consideration of the application of mechanical ventilation and vasoactive drug therapy will be covered in the Understanding disease mechanisms to provide optimal organ support course.Sepsis may be caused by a primary infection such as pneumonia, and identification of the source and infecting organism will be examined. In the critical care context sepsis may also may result from clinical interventions for other conditions: immuno-modulatory drugs, chemotherapy, invasive lines. Prevention and treatment of these will be covered.2) Outline contentThis course will explore the pathophysiology of sepsis and, through an examination of the pertinent literature, the repeated academic efforts to discover targeted therapies for the condition. Early identification of sepsis with appropriate intervention i.e. oxygen, fluids, antibiotics, and more advanced resuscitation, where indicated, has been shown to improve survival and will be included. Rational, empirical antimicrobial therapy will be highlighted. The importance of source control will be emphasised. The evidence base for fluid resuscitation, vasopressor support and for the use of corticosteroids will be explored. Rational guidelines for practical patient management will be discussed.It is widely accepted that Critical Care should have a Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) surveillance system in place. This course will explore incidence reporting of important infections such as Intubation Associated Pneumonia (IAP), Catheter Related Bloodstream Infection (CRBSI) and Blood Stream Infection (BSI). HDUs report incidence of Catheter Related Bloodstream Infection (CRBSI) and Blood Stream Infection (BSI). These HAIs are important, measurable and, with the course will examine whether with an effective quality improvement programme, they can be reduced.3) Student Learning ExperienceStudents will learn from subject matter experts in critical care through the medium of a virtual Microbiology intensive care ward round. Students will participate in asynchronous subject matter expert-led discussion boards, where they will each develop an allocated Â¿5-minute teachingÂ¿ topic for presentation at the weekly live tutorials.

Using an ePortfolio encompassing defined learning outcomes, students are required to compile evidence to demonstrate their learning and to reflect regularly on their chosen experience. The learning experience culminates in a written Final Reflective Report and an oral presentation of an ePoster.This Level 11 SLICC requires students to demonstrate the development of their advanced and specialist skills, integrated approach and understanding in terms of critical analysis, application, reflection, recognising and developing their skills and mindsets, and evaluation within a defined context of their learning experience. This course also enables demonstration of a student's ability to exercise autonomy and initiative at a professional level in practice and/or in a subject/discipline (or other approved) area.",
    "course_description": "A SLICC requires students to propose, develop and manage their own learning experience within a supported learning and assessment framework that will enable them to evidence how they have achieved the learning outcomes of the course. It offers students flexibility to address their own learning requirements, and academic and professional needs.This is a fully online course worth 20 credits, and students are expected to spend 140-200 hours in total on the course. Students who opt not to undertake a dissertation can conduct a SLICC as one of their course options for Year 3 of the Master's in Critical Care programme; planning of the SLICC should commence once students have completed their Year 2 Critical Care courses. Ideally, the chosen piece of work should link to their own contexts and/or employment. Examples include: Clinical Audit; change projects/new process and structure implementations in home department; Patient and Public Involvement (PPI)/community engagement; extra-curricular practical skills training relating to a career change or progression.The course runs in Blocks 1 and 4 of the academic year; this longitudinal design increases the time available to students for retrospective reflection. In addition, it coincides with an assessment milestone in the 60-credit Dissertation course, which will allow students to attend and present an ePoster as part of their entire year cohort, thus providing opportunities for peer learning and continuation of the collaborative online learning community established in Years 1 and 2 of the programme.Students will be assigned a SLICC Tutor, and will be provided with relevant materials and resources. In alignment with their future professional objectives and career aspirations, students will define their own learning outcomes in a 'Project Proposal'. Students will receive formative feedback from their SLICC Tutor on their 'Project Proposal' by the start of Year 3. The SLICC framework requires that students critically reflect regularly using a blog, and collect and curate evidence of their learning and skills development in an ePortfolio. They will submit and receive formative feedback on an 'Interim Report'. At the end of the SLICC, the summative assessment comprises two components: a self-reflective 'Final Report' (worth 50% of course mark) in which students should demonstrate how the learning outcomes for the course have been met, and an 'ePoster' (worth 50% of course mark) that students will present to their tutors and fellow Year 3 students during an online session.",

They will understand how to optimize the critical care environment to avoid heat loss, and how to facilitate body temperature reduction where indicated.2) Outline ContentPhysical injury causes the disease state known as trauma, which is the leading cause of death in young people worldwide. This course will focus on trauma causing a cascade of changes within the body that can lead to critical illness, including acidosis, coagulopathy and hypothermia. Critical Care can help to reduce the harm caused by trauma by application of early tertiary assessment and aggressive intervention aimed at halting this cascade and giving the best possible chance of returning patients to their normal level of function. This course will enable the student to assess and manage the critically ill trauma patient in the resuscitation and stabilisation phases using the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) approach, and to carry this into their critical care practice.Burn injury is a specific, globally important cause of trauma, which is often associated with other environmental injuries including smoke inhalation, carbon monoxide poisoning, toxin inhalation, electrocution. This course will enable the student to apply immediate first aid management and resuscitation of burns and to assess and treat the seriously burned patient requiring critical care.Poisoning is a common occurrence around the world. We know, for instance, that every day in the United Kingdom, many hundreds of people seek advice from a health professional following exposure to a drug or chemical. Exposure may happen by accident, through errors in the dosing of medicines, or from environmental or occupational exposures. It may also occur because of drug overdose taken in the context of self-harm or drug misuse. Poisoning is the third commonest presentation to critical care in Scotland. The numbers of substances involved are very large. Toxicology can impact the individual patient both from self-poisoning and from extraneous, environmental sources. This course will enable the student to manage any critically ill poisoned patient using a toxidrome-based approach, and to apply cognitive support such as TOXBASE.Maintenance of normal body temperature is complex, and temperature dysregulation impacts on many injured or poisoned critically ill patients. This course will explore the physiology of temperature regulation, hypothermia and hyperthermia, and temperature management in critical illness. The practical aspects of this will be demonstrated in a walk round of the virtual critical care unit.3) Student Learning ExperienceStudents will learn from clinical experts in critical care, toxicology, trauma and burns. The course activities will be based within the virtual intensive care unit where patients with trauma, poisoning and temperature dysregulation are located.  The students will work in teams during the discussion boards to create infographics on trauma, toxicology or temperature management in the critical care unit, evidencing their learning through this. Classic papers will be reviewed. They will revise the practicalities of creation of an infographic There will be weekly online safety in practice-based quizzes. The students will also engage with recorded tutorials and lectures featuring the Advanced Trauma Life Support approach; tertiary survey; key practical procedures and safety drills. They will also produce a reflective case report on one personally selected ethical or psycho-social aspect of the course.",

The course covers epidemiological theory and practices, critical appraisal, clinical statistics, ethics and research governance.The epidemiology overview will allow students to identify and conceptualise the principles of epidemiological study design and analysis, while quantifying disease in populations, including the calculation of disease frequencies. Critically evaluating varied clinical study designs will allow students to conceptualise an appropriate study design for a range of different research questions, while demonstrating detailed understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each study design, and when they should be used.Advanced statistical analysis will focus on the different types of descriptive statistics, important statistical concepts such as normal distribution, sampling error, standard error, confidence intervals, and the use of significance tests, error, p-values, and 1- and 2-sided t-tests. The course will also focus on tests to compare means, transforming data, correlating data, running regressions, and interpreting survival data.Finally, the importance of evidence-based research and clinical practice will be critically analysed. The students will demonstrate detailed understanding of varied research processes including undertaking a systematic literature search, formulating an explicit research question, choosing the correct study design, data collection and analysis techniques, and finally reporting and sharing findings. The course will demonstrate the practice of scholarly writing, and the understanding required to work with the uncertainties and complexities and ethical considerations inherent in the conduct of research with human subjects and/or tissue.The course assessment will be a written research proposal for a Randomised Controlled Trial with specific consideration of ethical issues, choice of study design, sampling issues, power analysis, randomisation, blinding and statistical analysis, to prove that all essential aspects of advanced research methods have been adequately understood, demonstrated and applied.",

This may either be a piece of original research (lab, translational or clinical), an extensive audit project or a systematic review. The subject matter must be relevant to the area of clinical medicine and we would envisage that students would consider something in their chosen specialty area. Before beginning, a detailed assignment proposal must be submitted and approved by the candidate's supervisor, and the Course organiser.This feature will require a high level of commitment and application from the candidate and provides a valuable exercise in the writing and presentation of information to a standard that engages appropriately with academic conventions in relation to style, tone, structuring and referencing. As an integral element of the final year the student will have ready access to a variety of research methods training to provide the skills required for successful completion of the dissertation.Supervision for this element of the MSc will be provided by existing academic staff and subject experts currently employed by the University of Edinburgh, National Health Service staff. Candidates will also be encouraged, where appropriate, to work closely with senior staff at their home institutions. Where a suitable academic link exists, these staff may be contracted to provide additional formal supervisory support.",

They will show demonstrable skills in analyzing the causes of diagnostic error, and in investigating and interpreting these.",
    "course_description": "Diagnosis is a critical praxis which is performed throughout healthcare. Error in diagnosis is therefore a pivotal safety problem, and may inflict significant harm. The US Institute of Medicine has reported that diagnoses are incorrect for one in ten patients. Surveys of patients and their families demonstrate that at least one person in three has first-hand experience with a diagnostic error. Diagnostic error is difficult to measure due to the complexity of the process, and of the clinical landscape in which it takes place. There are some surrogate markers to guide us. In North America malpractice claims for failure of diagnosis far outweigh those for surgical mistakes or medication error. One in twenty primary care patients will experience a diagnostic error every year.The Institute of Medicine has defined diagnostic error as the failure to (a) establish an accurate and timely explanation of the patient's health problem(s) or (b) communicate that explanation to the patient. Diagnoses may be delayed; missed; incomplete; wrong; or a combination of these.Our understanding of the causation of diagnostic error is improving. Most commonly, diagnostic error stems from interactions between the complexity of the diagnostic process, the complicated nature of healthcare provision, and the thinking and decision making of those formulating the diagnosis.This course is structured as an online distance learning course which will educate current doctors who are clinically active in the key areas involved in clinical decision making and diagnosis. These include, but are not limited to, demonstrating a working knowledge of Type 1 and Type 2 thinking in dual process theory, the importance of critical thinking in clinical practice and the diagnostic process, and the application of toggling to decision making in diagnosis, and differential diagnosis.The student should also be able to show applied knowledge of analyzing why diagnostic error occurs, including the practical performance of root cause analysis and cognitive autopsy to explicate the causes of diagnostic error.",

    "course_description": "This course is an online learning course that will address the impact and challenges associated with quality improvement initiatives within the healthcare context. Quality improvement In medical practice focuses on reducing medical errors and needless morbidity and mortality. However, quality improvement initiatives in healthcare can be very complex as there are numerous stakeholders in the medical industry who may have different expectations and are impacted differently through these initiatives. These stakeholders include providers, patients, families of patients, and medical employers. Providers tend to view quality in a technical sense, accuracy of diagnosis, appropriateness of therapy,and resulting health outcome, while patients want compassion as well as skill with clear communication. Balancing the concerns and challenges of all of these stakeholders is a difficult yet essential skill when producing and implementing quality improvement initiatives.Thus, this course will focus on the following priorities for meeting the requirements for optimal quality improvements in healthcare. First, students will review the core principles of improvement science and systems thinking in health care in order to develop creative responses to emerging problems. Students will also critically review the Model for Improvement specifically and understand how best to extend its use in practice. Students will also be asked to identify the scope of medical errors and conceptualise the impact on patients, families, and providers. By evaluating and understanding how medical errors occur, students will be expected to demonstrate initiative in developing a culture which allows new ways of thinking and learning from such failures.",

    "course_description": "We will introduce writing skills, plagiarism and referencing and will demonstrate and encourage use of appropriate referencing software. Online tutorials and advice about using the virtual learning environment (VLE) (Blackboard Collaborate) and the virtual classroom (e.g. Wimba) will be delivered. Students will be expected to actively use these tools throughout the course to create pieces of solo and group work e.g. making presentations, reviewing journal article and writing short review articles. We will demonstrate the tools and resources available to perform good, thorough and accurate literature searching both within the University library services and on the world-wide web. We will discuss how to conduct literature appraisal, and discuss the concept of evidence-based medicine. They will receive some initial information on statistics that will be developed in later modules. The University transferable skills team and librarians will be working with us to tailor these module to the students needs. This module will be completed entirely on-line with minimal tutor involvement allowing students to do this independently in advance of entering on to any part of the course. This is particularly helpful for those doing stand-alone modules within the VLE as part of another course.",

    "course_description": "The course is split into two phases:Phase 1 is an intensive one-day workshop mixing formal lectures by external experts with Q&A sessions and group discussions.Lectures will be delivered by expert speakers from clinical medicine, regulatory consultancies, quality assurance and the pharmaceutical industry.Phase 2 is a 6 week problem-based exercise where students in small groups are tasked with the generation of a WIKI page detailing the context and suggested approach for an ethical/regulatory issue in technology development. Each group will be assigned a staff mentor. The students will present their wiki to their peers and mentors to assess their approaches to the regulatory challenge. The assessment will generate new ideas and provide feedback to the students to refine and improve their strategy before they make their final presentation. The final presentation will be judged by the studentsÂ¿ mentors and the expert lecturers. After the presentations the students will receive further feedback from the assessment panel.",

They will be directed to compulsory readings in the literature which will act as a springboard for further readings. Activities will be designed so that students have to work independently, before discussing and presenting their work to peers and tutors.3. Skills and abilities in Communication: the success of online distance learning depends on interaction with peers and tutors. Activities will all have group components where students communicate with each other and learn to work together to achieve various goals. Discussion boards associated with each Module also will allow students to post questions as well as to answer questions of their peers. Students will develop good practice in communication and collaboration using modern online communication tools, including but not restricted to asynchronous discussion forums, wikis and other web 2.0 tools.4. Skills and abilities in Personal Effectiveness: the nature of the online distance learning environment means that students have to develop effective time management skills, as well as self-discipline with regards to regular study. They also need to juggle time-limited interactions with peers and tutors on which they are assessed.",

Activities will be designed so that students have to work independently, before discussing and presenting their work to peers and tutors.3.\tSkills and abilities in Communication: the success of online distance learning depends on interaction with peers and tutors. Activities will all have group components where students communicate with each other and learn to work together to achieve various goals. Discussion boards associated with each Module also will allow students to post questions as well as to answer questions of their peers. Students will develop good practice in communication and collaboration using modern online communication tools, including but not restricted to asynchronous discussion forums, wikis and other web 2.0 tools.4.\tSkills and abilities in Personal Effectiveness: the nature of the online distance learning environment means that students have to develop effective time management skills, as well as self-discipline with regards to regular study.

They will be directed to compulsory readings in the literature which will act as a springboard for further readings. Activities will be designed so that students have to work independently, before discussing and presenting their work to peers and tutors.3.\tSkills and abilities in Communication: the success of online distance learning depends on interaction with peers and tutors. Activities will all have group components where students communicate with each other and learn to work together to achieve various goals. Discussion boards associated with each Module also will allow students to post questions as well as to answer questions of their peers. Students will develop good practice in communication and collaboration using modern online communication tools, including but not restricted to asynchronous discussion forums, wikis and other web 2.0 tools.4.\tSkills and abilities in Personal Effectiveness: the nature of the online distance learning environment means that students have to develop effective time management skills, as well as self-discipline with regards to regular study. They also need to juggle time-limited interactions with peers and tutors on which they are assessed.",

Students will direct their own learning using the Student-Led Individually Created Course (SLICC) approach. They will plan, propose, carry out, reflect on and evaluate a piece of work from their own contexts. For radiographers taking this Certificate this may include their day to day work context.The SLICC framework requires that students use the generic learning outcomes to articulate their learning in their own defined project, reflect frequently using a blog, and collect and curate evidence of their learning in an e-portfolio. They receive relevant formative feedback on their Reflective Learning Proposal and on a Midway Reflective Report. The latter is in the same format as the Final Reflective Report, which forms the summative assessment. The above work is carried out under the guidance of an academic tutor.The course will encourage critical appraisal of students' own practical experiences, and allow them to reflect on their learning in the context of hybrid imaging and more specifically the combination of Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Positron Emision Tomography modalities.",
    "course_description": "This elective course is delivered online. Students not wishing to enrol on a SLICC will have the option of enrolling on a taught elective course bearing the same amount of credit.Students are expected to spend around 100 hours in total on this SLICC. Planning the SLICC should commence once students have completed most of their core courses. Students will be allowed to enrol on the SLICC while taking other core courses in the same semester.Ideally the chosen piece of work should link to their own contexts and/or employment. Students will be given an overview of what is expected well in advance. They will be provided with relevant support, materials and resources. Students define their own learning outcomes as a Proposal and by looking forward into their future professional/personal aims and career aspirations will examine the development of their attributes. Students will receive formative feedback on their reflective learning Proposal.The SLICC framework requires that students reflect frequently using a blog, and collect and curate evidence of their learning in an e-portfolio.

    "course_description": "1.\tAcademic DescriptionThis course spans two semesters (2 and 3), organised into four blocks with specific submission requirements and opportunities to interact with programme staff. Students will select a project area and complete their projects through coursework, culminating in a final report submission. Project options include an evidence-based review, a clinical resource, a proposal for change, or an audit. Each block is guided by specific objectives and key questions that students will use to reflect on their own project. While these questions apply universally to all project types, students will respond individually based on their unique experiences, critical analysis, and actions. The subject matter should pertain to pain management in their field of clinical practice. However, the course has been designed generically so that students from other programmes can undertake it and focus on their own are of clinical practice.2.\tOutline ContentThis project represents the synthesis of knowledge and comprehension gained throughout their taught courses on the MSc Clinical Management of Pain programme. To accomplish this, students are required to analyse published evidence, guidance, and best practices to provide a rationale for their decisions and chosen methodologies. The course structure allows for reflection and adaptability of methods for future endeavours.3.\tStudent Learning ExperienceThis project demands a high level of commitment and dedication from the candidate, providing a valuable exercise in applying their learning to practical or tangible problems. Students will be advised to collaborate closely with supervising tutors on the programme. Ongoing support will be available to students through scheduled live sessions, allowing them to integrate received feedback and enhance their work.The course is based on experiential learning with the focus placed on the process rather than the outcome.  Students are asked to reflect on their experiences individually and with the group, and with the support of their peers and programme team develop solutions to these real-world problems.Programme staff will encourage the group to engage in critical thinking and testing of ideas to help develop their strength and usefulness.  Students will be asked to develop their method of tackling problems so they can go on to complete more projects beyond their time at the University.Students will be expected to undertake and complete a 20-credit SLICC in semester 1 prior to the 40-credit course where students identify the skills and resources, they will be required to complete the project in semesters 2 & 3 (40-credits).

    "summary": "This course is a 20 credit SCQF level 11 course placed within the MSc Clinical Management of Pain.The Course will cover the evidence for and the principles and techniques that support Lifestyle Medicine (LM) in the management of pain. There will be a focus on the Pillars of Lifestyle Medicine (sleep, nutrition, movement, social connection, stress reduction and avoiding harmful substances) and how they impact on health with a particular focus on their specific role in the pain experience.Students enrolling in this course will be expected to apply their learning to explore how they can integrate LM into their existing practice. This integration process will involve actively seeking out resources and guidance that are applicable both to their professional environment and to the specific needs of their patients. It also encourages a collaborative learning approach. Students will be required to share their findings and strategies on discussion boards, fostering a community of practice. This process will not only enable them to receive feedback but also provide support to their peers.As part of the course assessment, students must demonstrate how they can justify the use of the resources they have identified and communicate their applicability effectively. This assessment strategy aims to enhance students' abilities to communicate change and influence others, crucial skills in the field of LM.The course design has been influenced by the traits set out in the Edinburgh Student Vision and Curriculum Transformation Programme. It is structured to provide students with the opportunity to become disciplinary experts, equipped with advanced specialist skills, knowledge, and experience. The emphasis on using personal resources to integrate LM interventions in the context of their own practice, and the ability to communicate this justification effectively, will cultivate reflexive learners who are adept at applying solutions to real-world challenges.",
    "course_description": "The course is comprised of 10 weeks of teaching; each week will comprise a theme. The course will cover:1.\tWhy do we need LM?2.\tWhat is LM?3.\tPillars of LM: The role of sleep in pain management.4.\tPillars of LM: The role of nutrition in pain management.5.\tPillars of LM: The role of physical activity in pain management.6.\tPillars of LM: The role of social connection in pain management.7.\tPillars of LM: The role of stress and mental health in pain management.8.\tHow to practice LM?

Most particularly, in many countries, there is an increasing number and proportion of older patients presenting with painful conditions which do not necessarily form part of any other life limiting condition.

For example, as life expectancy increases, the extent to which many surgical procedures are contemplated and undertaken is multiplied, with the consequent necessity to develop the means to manage pain sensitively in conjunction with advanced frailty and co-morbidity.This is a 10-week distance learning course worth 20 credits. Students are expected to spend 20 hours per week on this course.  Students will be given a brief overview of the course and will then be provided with relevant materials and resources.  Specific tasks and online exercises relating to each weeks topic will be set.  A final submitted assessment will be required for the course.This is an elective course and may not be available every academic year.

Students will study the physiological basis of disease and pathology after initial resuscitation, and relate this to current treatment and practice.The course is designed to bridge the gap between initial resuscitation and care in the emergency department (the first 4 hours of resuscitation and emergency care), through the next 24-28 hours, until transfer to PICU or discharge.  This will enable the student to understand and practise paediatric critical care skills.  It will form a bridge between emergency care and paediatric intensive care.",

Reproductive Science also addresses important diseases affecting reproductive health, such as endometriosis, pre-eclampsia, polycystic ovary syndrome, testicular dysgenesis syndrome and cancers of the reproductive system. Furthermore, Reproductive Science has helped to shape powerful new research tools, including the production of transgenic animals and therapeutic cloning which offer the prospects of benefit in many branches of the biological, biomedical, medical and veterinary sciences.",

Students reflect regularly and throughout their defined experience, specifically by reflective blogging, which they collect and curate as a reflective e-portfolio, to provide evidence of their learning.As a participating student, undertaking a SLICC will enable you to create a learning experience which is unique to you and your own needs and academic and professional aims.  You will demonstrate your learning and academic achievement against learning outcomes in a defined experiential learning and assessment framework.This course will require you to demonstrate the development of your skills and understanding in terms of critical analysis, application, self-reflection, recognising and developing your skills and mindsets, and evaluation within the context of the learning experience you have defined. This course will also enable you to demonstrate your ability to exercise autonomy and initiative, and deal with challenges that may present themselves in an academic subject/discipline (or other approved) area, and/or at an applied professional level in practice.",
    "course_description": "A SLICC requires you to propose, develop and manage your own learning experience within a supported learning and assessment framework that will enable you to evidence how you have achieved the learning outcomes of the course.  It offers you flexibility to address your own learning requirements, and academic and professional needs.Your self-designed learning experience is required to adhere to a defined learning and assessment framework that supports and enables you to self-direct and manage your own learning experience. Within this structure however, you have real flexibility regarding the topic or theme, content of study and nature of your experience, provided your proposal is academically feasible, and is approved by your tutor.Your SLICC may, for example, be based upon a particular extra-curricular learning opportunity such as an internship, work experience, pro-bono activity, community engagement, volunteering, study-abroad or indeed may be entirely self-directed. In agreement with your own programme, your SLICC could also be based on your wider co-curricular range of activities in which you engage to support your main course of study, and how these contribute to your wider development.  These may include your learning and its usage, from internal and external seminar programmes, workshops, conferences, and training courses, and these can be partially blended with extra-curricular activities.   It may focus on a theme of professional and /or personal interest such as sustainability, social responsibility, external engagement, equality and cultural diversity, or a disciplinary or interdisciplinary-based research theme or application.The steps in undertaking a SLICC are as follows:1) Identify a suitable opportunity within which to undertake your learning experience2) Write your draft proposal and submit to your tutor/advisor for approval3) Self-direct and manage your own learning experience, as detailed within the framework4) Actively and regularly reflect upon and document your experience with evidence and use that as a basis for writing your self-critical 'Interim Reflective Report', then your 'Final Reflective Report'5) Formatively self-assess and submit your 'Final Reflective Report' for summative assessment by your tutor.The steps identified above each require a significant amount of thought and input and will ultimately form part of a 'time-based' e-portfolio of reflective evidence, which you will curate and use in the assessment of your SLICC.Undertaking a SLICC you will not only develop the content of your learning experience but also produce an agreed portfolio of outputs.  You must evidence what you have learned and, importantly, where you demonstrate how you have met the learning outcomes for the course.",
