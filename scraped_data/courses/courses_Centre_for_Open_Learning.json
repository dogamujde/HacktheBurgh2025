With drawing as its foundation, the course aims to give students the confidence, passion and commitment to pursue their chosen degree pathway, whilst preparing students for progression to successful study of Access Art and Design 2. The course is project-driven with practical workshops that enable students to expand upon basic skills to experiment with materials, digital engagement and 2d/3d ideas relating to the students' expanding knowledge of contemporary art/design and cultural issues.",
    "course_description": "1) Academic DescriptionThis course is offered as part of the Access Programme (Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences). The Access Programme aims to prepare students for undergraduate study by introducing them to a range of essential skills and encouraging them to employ theseskills in a confident and flexible way.Semester 1 courses are designed to foster those skills which are broadly transferable within their respective disciplinary areas and are designed to prepare students for progression to semester 2.This, semester 1 course will provide an inclusive, supportive, stimulating and creative environment in which students are supported to create strong portfolios suitable for entry to the wide variety of art and design degree programmes (for example, Art, Intermedia Art, Painting, Photography, Sculpture, Fine Art, Animation, Fashion, Film & Television, Graphic Design, Illustration, Interior Design, Jewellery & Silversmithing, Performance Costume, Product Design, Textiles, etc.).The core focus of Access Art and Design 1 is in skills development and portfolio preparation, supporting each student to demonstrate their artistic ability and potential in relation to their chosen degree pathways. Students will be encouraged to identify their potential degree pathways at an early stage of the course so that their learning can be tailored effectively towards individual outcomes and tailored portfolios. In line with a student's application to ECA and the 'portfolio assessment criteria' (which can also be used to map on to other institutions submission applications) four key areas will be blended into the learning journey: enquiry and visual research; idea development and material/technical exploration; critical judgement, reflection and resolution; and contextual awareness.The course will include core skills-development workshops in a range of drawing and 2d/3d skills and techniques, visual recording, mixed-media experimentation and confidence building, digital engagement, and portfolio presentation along with enrichment activities to support progression. Work will be focussed around a themed project/ live brief which is designed to enable students to engage with, and demonstrate independent creative exploration and underpin their creative output and skills development.2) Course ContentThe course is designed around portfolio requirements for entry to degree courses in art and design.Each of the twelve practical studio sessions includes tutor input on a range of issues and approaches within contemporary art and design.  These sessions are designed to stimulate the students' work and provide greater depth to their portfolios.Evidence of drawing enquiry and visual research is a core requirement of all art and design degrees, so both primary observational and experimental 2d and 3d drawing forms the first half of Art and Design 1, through observation and photography in journals, sketchbooks and developing mixed-media work, along with emotive exploration. Students will be directed towards specific degree course preparation and additional digital training if this is required for progression. Thereafter the course is project-based, encouraging students to develop interest in ideas and engage with themes relating to their practical work, undertaking independent research and practice-led enquiry.The class project/live brief provides a broad theme around which students can structure work for their application portfolio, supported through individual and group tutorials and critiques. Students will be encouraged to become reflective thinkers and engage with digital learning, though the expansion of creative ideas between classes and weekly submission of individual digital portfolios.3) Student Learning ExperienceStudents will typically learn through weekly studio-based and site- specific practical enquiry in a creative and supportive environment.  Learning will be supported by short seminars of contemporary art/ design and cultural issues, in order to strengthen theoretical engagement with their practice. The seminars will take place weekly before each practical session. Whilst the course is structured towards the broad needs for all programmes of continued study, students will be encouraged to be reflective learners, and to work towards their chosen pathways through independent research, and journal and portfolio development.Students will submit five formative pieces of work linked to the learning outcomes for the course, in the form of physical and digital portfolios, along with one short presentation on their planned project work.Constructive feedback (both verbal and written) will be provided by the course tutor. Students will be encouraged to consider feedback and to respond to this in future work.No grades will be provided for individual pieces of work, but an overall indicative course grade will be given at the end of semester based upon participation, coursework and response to feedback.In addition to support and feedback at course level, all students on the Access Programme will engage via an online learning journal, where they will be prompted to reflect on their learning experience, feedback and progress and will receive personalised guidance and support from their Personal Tutor.Students will also participate in a range of cultural and social engagement activities which are intended to complement their studies, increase cultural capital, encourage engagement with peers and communities, and build a sense of belonging.",

Advanced workshops will be delivered in a range of drawing and 2d/3d skills and techniques, visual recording, mixed-media experimentation and confidence building, digital engagement, and presentation of a final resolved body of work.2) Course ContentThis course is designed around completing individual digital portfolio requirements for entry to degree programmes in the creative arts and building upon the skills and knowledge developed in Access Art and Design 1 to create comprehensive physical portfolios and a resolved body of work. Each of the sixteen-practical studio (or site-specific) sessions will introduce a range of contemporary art/design issues, along with current debates in contemporary culture to inspire and stimulate the students' work and provide greater depth to portfolios. The course will include workshops on portfolio visual presentation to encourage a critically refined submission; and supportive, individually-tailored creative workshops. To prepare the student for progression, reading/research will be encouraged to be synthesised with individual pathways/year one of potential degree programmes.Students will present their individual projects to the group following a creative confidence-building workshop, and progress to develop experimental and resolved outcomes through exploration at intensive workshops in contemporary collage, colour, painting and mixed-media, 2d/3d surface treatment, and digital experimentation and printmaking. As part of their summative submission students will present their resolved work alongside their portfolio of ideas, studies and sketchbooks.3) Student Learning ExperienceStudents will continue to develop through weekly studio-based and practical enquiry in a creative and supportive environment. Students will be inspired by short seminars of contemporary art/design and cultural issues, to strengthen their practice's theoretical engagement. Whilst the course is structured towards the broad needs for all programmes of continued study, students will continue to be reflective learners, working towards their chosen pathways through independent research, journal and portfolio development.As with most art and design courses, students will receive regularverbal appraisal throughout the course, both on a one-to-one basis and in critiques; analysing and reflecting on their work through tutor led discussions.A formative presentation and assessment of work in progress will take place around week 9 to prepare the student for the journey ahead. Constructive feedback (both verbal and written) will be provided by the course tutor. Students will be encouraged to consider feedback and to respond to this in future work.In addition to support and feedback at course level, all students on the Access Programme will engage via an online learning journal, where they will be prompted to reflect on their learning experience, feedback and progress and will receive personalised guidance and support from their Personal Tutor.Students will also participate in a range of cultural and social engagement activities which are intended to complement their studies, increase cultural capital, encourage engagement with peers and communities, and build a sense of belonging.",

The central aim of the course is to build confidence and inculcate good skills of academic reading and writing in preparation for progression to Access Humanities 2.In addition, students' intellectual curiosity will be cultivated, directing them to new areas of academic interest and facilitating an ability to undertake independent study in these areas. The course will develop the capacity for independent thought and the ability both to evaluate contrasting positions in academic debate, and to engage in inter-disciplinary thinking in the Humanities.2) Outline ContentA range of entry-level texts and excerpts will be employed with which to develop a range of skills: from essential study skills (e.g.  planning and structuring coursework), through core academic skills (e.g. interpreting sources), towards an ability to work reflectively and independently.The course aims to provide students with an insight into a range of central disciplines in the Humanities: Art History, Classics, History, Literature and Philosophy. Representative texts and works will be selected in order both to develop students' awareness of the specific nature of these disciplines, and of the skills which are employed in studying, appraising, and writing a critical and scholarly response to the text or work in hand.Teaching will emphasise both the similarities and the differences between those skills which are employed in, for example, studying a poem, a painting, or a philosophical argument.3) Student Learning ExperienceTeaching will be principally via tutorial. Tutorials will be student-centred, with small group and individual tasks related to the text or artwork under consideration. Students will thus be encouraged to share their understanding and to participate in collaborative learning.A range of technologies will be employed, both in the classroom, and in students' work outside class, with a view to developing individuals' familiarity with digital technologies employed in learning.Students will submit a number of formative pieces of work linked to the learning outcomes for the course.

    "course_description": "1) Academic DescriptionThis course is offered as part of the Access Programme (Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences). The Access Programme aims to prepare students for undergraduate study by introducing them to a range of essential skills and encouraging them to employ theseskills in a confident and flexible way.Semester 1 courses are designed to foster those skills which are broadly transferable within their respective disciplinary areas and are designed to prepare students for progression to semester 2.This semester 1 course aims to introduce students to a range of Social Science disciplines and the academic, study and personal and practical skills which are required for successful study of these disciplines at undergraduate level. The central aim of the course is to build confidence and inculcate good skills of academic reading and writing in preparation for progression to Access Social Sciences 2.In addition, it will channel students' wonderment about their social world into areas of defined intellectual interest, cultivating their curiosity and facilitating an ability to undertake independent study.  Students will be given a solid knowledge and skills basis from which to compare, contrast and evaluate different disciplines, approaches and positions within the social sciences.2) Outline ContentA range of entry-level texts, excerpts, examples and case studies will be employed with which to develop a range of skills: from essential study skills (e.g. note-taking), through core academic skills (e.g. interpreting data), towards an ability to work reflectively and independently.Students will gain a broad overview of where and how key Social Science disciplines (Anthropology, Economics, Psychology, Social Policy, Sociology) depart from one another, and where they converge. Representative research techniques (observation; interviews; surveys, modelling; experiments) will be selected to develop students' awareness of the specific nature of these disciplines, and of the skills which are employed in studying, appraising and writing in a critical and scientific manner.Teaching will emphasise similarities and differences between how and why certain skills and techniques are deployed and why they are or are not appropriate in varying contexts.3) Student Learning ExperienceTeaching will be principally via tutorial. Tutorials will be student-centred, with small group and individual tasks related to the text or case study under consideration. Students will thus be encouraged to share their understanding and to participate in collaborative learning.A range of technologies will be employed, both in the classroom, and in students' work outside class, with a view to developing individuals' familiarity with digital technologies employed in learning.Students will submit a number of formative pieces of work linked to the learning outcomes for the course. Constructive feedback (both verbal and written) will be provided by the course tutor.  Students will be encouraged to consider feedback and to respond to this in future work.No grades will be provided for individual pieces of work but an overall indicative course grade will be given based upon participation, coursework and response to feedback.In addition to support and feedback at course level, all students on the Access Programme will engage via an online learning journal, where they will be prompted to reflect on their learning experience, feedback and progress and will receive personalised guidance and support from their Personal Tutor.Students will also participate in a range of cultural and social engagement activities which are intended to complement their studies, increase cultural capital, encourage engagement with peers and communities, and build a sense of belonging.",

Alternatively, the course can be delivered more intensely or as a block if required.Over the class sessions  the course will cover:- Introduction to contemporary artistic approaches to the city- Introduction to research methods for gathering visual and sensory information from the city- Structured tutor-led exercises - visual and sensory research using photography, sketchbooks and sound recordings- Practical demonstrations  - how to make a sound recording- Practical demonstrations - how to use mobile phone photography  to gather visual images of the city- Practical demonstrations  - how to alter images digitally and manually- Project brief - visual research (weeks 1-3)- Project brief - sensory research (weeks 4-6)- One to one discussions with students to develop an independent project (weeks 7-10)- One to one discussions with students regarding project development, materials and and project resolutionThe Learning ExperienceThe teaching will be based and delivered in specialist art and design studios or workshops and will typically include a range of practical exercises, introductions to techniques, processes and concepts, and set projects which lead to more focused and personal exploration. Over the course, students's progress will be monitored and supported by the tutor.  Teaching will include practical demonstrations, one to one tuition, group discussions and critiques.Several tutor-led, structured group exercises will take place off-campus in nearby locations in Edinburgh. These will last around one hour.  Students will also be encouraged to conduct some independent  visual and sensory research  during class time and also as part of their directed study.For work required to be undertaken after the class hours are complete, the course tutor will set students a 'directed study plan' which can be undertaken without the need for specialist workshops or access to models.Directed study will include research into a range of suggested artists or designers and their associated movements to engender a contextual awareness of the sculpted figure in visual culture. Students will be expected to demonstrate how the research has informed their work through annotated sketchbooks or visual journals and practical outcomes.  The Directed Study Plan will include preparing evidence of research and practical work to form an appropriate presentation for assessment.",

There will be a short lecture, introducing the work of the First and Second World War artists: Paul Nash, John Piper, Graham Sutherland and Eric Ravilious. Students will make small collages with newspaper and brown paper based on still life set up.Week 2. There will be a trip to St. MaryÂ¿s or St. Giles Cathedral to gather information through drawing. A demonstration on how to get enough information with thumbnail sketching will be given.Week 3. Students will make more ambitious collages, based on their drawings.Week 4. There will be a short lecture on the St. Ives group: Ben Nicholson, Winifred Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth, Alfred Wallis and Christopher Wood. Students will look at different ways of integrating line with collage.Week 5. Students will make low, monochrome reliefs.Week 6. There will be a short lecture on the later generation of St. Ives artists; Peter Lanyon, Wilhemena Barnes- Graham, Margaret Mellis and Patrick Heron. Students will examine some of the techniques they used.Weeks 7-10. Students will complete a project of their own devising, based on the knowledge gained through studying the above artists, but bringing a contemporary relevance to the work.

    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionIn this course students will look at how Dadaism led to Surrealism, which in turn influenced Abstract Expressionism. Through a series of mini lectures, looking at key artists in each area, and practical, studio- based exercises, students will explore how these art movements grew out of each other. Students will have an opportunity to devise their own project, developing a personal response to the art historical information examined, but bringing a contemporary relevance to the work.Outline of  ContentThe course teaching is typically delivered over weekly class sessions of around 3 hours each and totaling 30 hours. Alternatively, the course can be delivered more intensely or as a block if required.Over the class sessions the course will cover:Week 1. There will be a short lecture on the work of the Dadaists: Hans Arp, Hannah Hoch, Francis Picabia and Kurt Schwitterz.  Students will work on simple collages and group drawing exercises designed to stimulate the imagination.Week2. There will be a mini lecture on Surrealist Art, including the works of Max Ernst, Rene Magritte, Leonora Carrington and Joan Miro. Students will make a series of automatic drawings and collages..Week3. Dreams and Narratives: Students will create small paintings based on dreams or pieces of writing.Week 4. There will be a short lecture on the influence of Surrealism on Abstract Expressionism. Artists looked at will include Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, Helen Frankenthaler and Joan Mitchell. Students will try out a few techniques, designed to explore this connection.Week 5. Students will experiment with some more Abstract Expressionist techniques, including action painting.Week 6. Students will further examine aspects of Abstract Expressionists and will experiment with some more techniques, including Colour Field.Weeks 7-10. Students will develop their own project based on experiments done in the past six weeks. Emphasis will be on developing a personal response to the material examined and bringing a contemporary relevance to the work.The Learning ExperienceThe teaching will be based and delivered in specialist art and design studios or workshops and will typically include a range of practical exercises, introductions to techniques, processes and concepts, and set projects which lead to more focused and personal exploration. Over the course, studentsÂ¿ progress will be monitored and supported by the tutor.  Teaching will include practical demonstrations, one to one tuition, group discussions and critiques.For work required to be undertaken after the class hours are complete, the course tutor will set students a Â¿directed study planÂ¿ which can be undertaken without the need for specialist workshops or access to models.Directed study will include research into a range of suggested artists and their associated movements to engender a contextual awareness. Students are expected to demonstrate how their research has informed their work through annotated sketchbooks, a visual digital journal and practical outcomes.The Directed Study Plan will include preparing evidence of research and practical work to form an appropriate presentation for assessment.",

    "course_description": "1) Academic DescriptionThe aim of this course is to develop a student's existing skills and knowledge of Adobe software and enhance their creative approaches for illustration. Beginning with project-led tasks and exercises, exploring and employing various Adobe techniques and practical research approaches, students will begin to develop their individual styles, before embarking on a self-directed project.It is expected that those students taking the course will have basic Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator skills, but students will be taught more advanced techniques and shown how to make the most of and apply digital processes. The potentials and limitations of the format will be discussed alongside the history of illustration, and how new media techniques have changed the industry in recent years.We will look at how students can replicate traditional drawing and painting techniques digitally, using Adobe software, and explore why you would choose to use digital processes instead of traditional ones. Students will also explore how both approaches can be used in tandem, with digital media being used to enhance their existing artistic practice, rather than as a replacement for their current way of working.Students will have the opportunity within the self-directed projects to focus on their particular areas of interest, but the course will also focus on the varied applications of illustration, from logo design and character design to illustration for book covers and as well as many others.2) Outline ContentStudents will explore digital illustration through a series of set briefs and a final self-directed project, to create a varied and diverse body of work.Students will:-\tBe introduced to Adobe Photoshop as a tool for painting and drawing using drawing tablets to replicate traditional techniques.-\tDevelop skills in Adobe Illustrator as a tool for image manipulation.-\tDevelop skills in Adobe Illustrator and vector-based image creation. Tracing images and working from source materials.-\tUnderstand workflow, from reading and understanding a brief, pitching initial ideas, to development to a well-resolved conclusion.-\tDevelop contextual awareness of contemporary and historical examples of illustrators working in digital and non-digital media through producing case studies and research on illustrators, movements and ideas.-\tTake an idea from conception through development to a final resolved conclusion.3) Student Learning ExperienceDuring the first 5-weeks of the course, emphasis shall be placed on developing students' practical skills, focusing on various approaches for researching and developing a project brief. These sessions shall also engage the students in developing and enhancing a range of technical skills in the use of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. During this period, short class-based presentations shall be given, underpinning the design theory and providing a wider Illustration context.Students will then develop a short self-directed project for the remaining 5-weeks of the course. Employing new ways of thinking for developing personal research, practical skills in using Adobe and supported by appropriate contextual references, evolving their own ideas and practice.Students will leave the course with a body of work that is an exploration of various illustration techniques and styles, through using various digital approaches.",

Students will learn a variety of techniques using Adobe Photoshop and how to combine new technology with traditional approaches to creating artwork. Considering composition through colour, texture, layering, filters and effects, students will develop a portfolio, importing and manipulating their own source material, and become familiar with how to present files for manufacturing and printmaking.Outline of ContentThe course teaching is delivered over weekly class sessions. Over the class sessions the course will cover:* A tour of the interface will be provided and through the weeks, explanation for all of the key tools associated with Adobe Photoshop.* An introduction to themes and concepts of the work of artists working with Photoshop* Importing from the internet, digital cameras, scanning drawings or working directly with the computer are all options for developing source material. Getting this content into the software will be demonstrated.* The course aims to tailor a working method to the individuals creative vision. Photoshop is vast and you will be encouraged to learn utilities strategically through discussion with the class and tutor.* How the image pane is constructed as a dot matrix. Resolution and sizing images will be discussed and we will consider the different modes of interpolation and extrapolation (adding or removing pixels)* We will look at how images are constructed in terms of layers and how to manage these.* An early tutorial to introduce the selection tools and how to resize and move articles around the picture space.* A more in depth look at selections and how to refine them will lead to introduction to distributing pixels within these boundaries. Here we introduce tools such as paint bucket and the brush tool as a way to further develop the compositions* An in-depth explanation will be provided on all settings and palettes associated with the brush tool and how these can be controlled using devices such as graphics tablets. You will see how to create your own brushes and manage pallets of these custom brushes* We will learn to use layer masks to obscure and reveal areas within the image pane and edit brightness / contrast, hue and saturation, amongst other adjustments, applying these effects discriminately.* How to convert your content into a smart object and apply effects, filters and textures in a non destructive mode of working (ensuring your file remains as open and malleable as possible)..* Vector functionality using the pen tool. How the tool works and its specific attributes including, stroke and fill paths, vector masks, shapes and text.* A presentation on digital printing techniques and the potential for vectors to programme machines such as vinyl cutters and cnc routers.* Advice on proofing and setting artwork up to present to industry.* An introduction to the animation and 3 dimensional editing functionality that Photoshop provides.* Directed study devised in discussion with the student to encourage more personal and focused work* We will construct a presentation of the work we have created using the utilities and techniques picked up through the course.* A group critique to share studentsÂ¿ findings and new techniques within the course",

    "course_description": "This course will allow students the space and time to develop and sustain a body of personal drawings, based on a project theme and idea. The course begins by focusing on a specific location, to gather research and make a series of studies, before focusing on creating resolved works. Employing the knowledge gained, students will then embark on a more personal theme or subject matter, exploring the potential of an idea through a sustained focus, employing a range of drawing methods, approaches and processes, to produce a body of related works.Outline of ContentThe course teaching is typically delivered over weekly class sessions of around 3 hours each and totaling 30 hours. Alternatively, the course can be delivered more intensely or as a block if required.Over the class sessions the course will cover:- Employing the use of the sketchbook for recording, researching and evidencing work.- Develop a series of works, based on directed and personal references themes and subjects.- Engaging in independent research and projects.- Employ a range of drawing materials and approaches to explore possibilities and lines of enquiry.- Make site-specific observational drawings (as required).- Use photographic references to support developing ideas and themes.- A series of discussions and group critiques based on each project theme.- Introduction to a range of relevant artists.- Keep a log/blog during the period of the course to record learning, achievements and challenges.The Learning ExperienceThe teaching will be based and delivered in specialist art and design studios or workshops and will typically include a range of practical exercises, introductions to techniques, processes and concepts, and set projects which lead to more focused and personal exploration. Over the course, students' progress will be monitored and supported by the tutor.  Teaching will include practical demonstrations, one to one tuition, group discussions and critiques.For work required to be undertaken after the class hours are complete, the course tutor will set students a 'directed study plan' which can be undertaken without the need for specialist workshops or access to models.Directed study will include research into a range of suggested artists and their associated movements to engender a contextual awareness.

    "course_description": "Academic descriptionThis course offers a detailed examination of the careers and work of four key figures in the Northern Renaissance: Bosch, DÃ¼rer, Holbein and Bruegel. Classes will take each artist in turn to examine their style, subject matter and background: the highly detailed religious narratives of Bosch; the range of media in the work of DÃ¼rer; the patronage and portraiture of Holbein; and Bruegel's depictions of everyday life. The work of each artist will be examined in detail, and considered in the context of the politics and culture of northern Europe as well as alongside artistic developments elsewhere in Europe.Outline content- Bosch, early career.- Bosch: painter of works 'tainted with heresy' or maker of paintings akin to 'books of great wisdom'?- DÃ¼rer, early career.- DÃ¼rer in Venice.- DÃ¼rer's changing view of self.- Holbein, early career.- Holbein and Henry VIII.- Bruegel: 'Pieter the Droll', peasant yokel of popular tradition or cultured urbanite?- Bruegel and his 'all-embracing sympathy with humanity'.- Material Culture.Student learning experienceThe course will be taught by informal lecture and discussion. Students will be guided in close analysis of paintings and other works of art, and will be introduced to key concepts in the study of Art History at this level. Students taking the course for credit will receive guidance on how to present their art history essay, and will be able to discuss their assessment with the course tutor, through a formative assessment essay plan which leads directly to the final essay.",

You will learn how critical understanding of contemporary, historical and related contexts can inform and inspire creative works and be encouraged to generate and explore potential lines of enquiry using appropriate materials, techniques and processes.  Through reflective practice students will be able to review work and its progress.OUTLINE OF CONTENTIn preparation for this course students will need to carry out trips to museums and galleries (where possible), gathering relevant research in preparation to present a body of visual material, supported by and in agreement with the tutor.Based on first-hand experiences, as a result from visiting galleries, museums, attending virtual experiences and attending seminars, students will identify a focus for a personal investigation.Gathering, selecting and organising visual examples of key works from primary sources in a sketchbook.Begin practical investigations using relevant media, techniques and processes.Using analysis to explore images and artefacts; identifying the main features of the work, thinking about how ideas, feelings and meanings can be conveyed and interpreted, how they relate to the time and place in which they were made and to their social and cultural contexts.Developing an art and design literacy skills set; continuing to build a knowledge and understanding for a visual language, employing art and design terminologies as and when appropriate.Using personal understanding to reflect upon the learning experience, using this to develop a growing knowledge and appreciation about a subject and to generate potential lines of enquiry.Carrying out further investigations to make comparisons, in turn, developing a greater understanding for a subject.Developing a knowledge for interrogating personal ideas and exploratory works through forming connections with a body of contextual research.The Learning ExperienceThe teaching will include a range of practical exercises, introductions to techniques, processes and concepts, and set projects which lead to more focused and personal exploration. Over the course, students' progress will be monitored and supported by the tutor.  Teaching will include practical demonstrations, one to one tuition, group discussions and critiques.For work required to be undertaken after the class hours are complete, the course tutor will set students a 'directed study plan' which can be undertaken without the need for specialist workshops or access to models.Directed study will include research into a range of suggested artists and their associated movements to engender a contextual awareness.

Students will learn the basic skills of 2D digital animation by establishing a working knowledge of Adobe Photoshop and Adobe After Effects using Mac computers. Through a range of hands-on exercises, such as Stop-frame and 'puppet tools', students will gain essential knowledge of using a storyboard, setting up an environment or composition and working with sound to make short animated sequences.",
    "course_description": "1) Academic DescriptionThe aim of this course is to develop students basic skills and knowledge of Adobe Photoshop and After Effects for creating short animation projects. Beginning with project-led tasks and exercises, exploring and employing various Adobe techniques, students will begin to develop their individual styles, before embarking on a self-directed project. It is expected that those students taking the course will be able to work on a Mac computer.The chronological order of this course is structured around the stages of animation production, in order to guide students from the start to finish of a short animation project. The teaching of pre-production, production, and post-production concepts will be supported by in-class exercises. Students will be encouraged to create animation content in their own time through directed study projects supported through guided demonstrations and introduction to relevant techniques and software within the class, as well as supported by contextual references as and when appropriate. Studio exercises will take place in a computer lab equipped with Adobe Photoshop and After Effects.2) Outline ContentStudents will, throughout the duration of this class, gain competency in several animation areas. Supported through in-class exercises, these will include:- Idea generation and story planning.- Review of other animators and effective animation pieces from throughout history.- Research and development of assets.- Basics of animation, frames, timing, spacing, including camera movement and lighting.- Animation planning by use of storyboards.- Sound recording and voiceover.- Animation techniques, animating assets, sequencing, puppet tool.- Visual storytelling using editing and effective use of After Effects.- Basic sound design using After Effects and Audition.- Rendering and exporting animation clips.- Group critiques and individual formative feedback.3) Student Learning ExperienceStudents will be taught as a group, taking them through the various stages of creating a successful animation piece, although developing assets and animating scenes as directed study exercises will be encouraged. The class exercises will give students the opportunity to learn the basics of animation and develop an ability to use digital processes to form a short piece of work. One-on-one discussion of student projects and interests will support student learning, as well as class critiques on work created during the course which will be contextualised, showcasing animators works to inspire but also challenge the student viewpoints.",

    "course_description": "1) Academic DescriptionTo introduce students to the theories, techniques, core concepts and definitions of sculpture within the field of fine art.  The course aims to develop a broad appreciation and understanding of sculptural theory and practice with particular reference to European and North American traditions of sculpture over the last century. Students will be informed about and guided through the use of some traditional making materials including card, clay, casting plaster, plaster bandage and wire, and introduced to making techniques such as clay construction methods, mould making, relief casting, basic armature building and addition/ subtraction techniques. These making experiences will then be explored within the context of contemporary sculpture alongside other approaches such as abstraction, assemblage, appropriation and conceptual sculpture.2) Outline ContentThe course will cover:Introduction and overview of sculpture practice set mainly within the European and North American canon of the 20th and 21st Centuries.Introduction to a range of primary materials and basic sculpture making techniques including constructing in 3D with card, clay and plaster.Experimental making and improvisation.Assemblage and appropriation; working with found, ready-made and appropriated materials and objects.Critical reflection on makers motivation; the 'why?' and 'how?' of the creative process.Examine context in relation to making; artist's personal identity and experience, time, place, purpose and narrative.Examine context in relation to exhibiting; permanent or temporary, indoors/outdoors, gallery/civic space/wilderness, sustainability.Develop and demonstrate a personal research focus, theme or direction.Create an individual sculpture or series of sculptures, maquettes, proposals or experimental works.3) Student Learning ExperienceThe contact hours of this course will be delivered in fit-for-purpose art and design studios and will include a range of theoretical and contextual presentations and discussions. This course involves hands-on learning approaches with introductions to techniques, processes, concepts and practical and experimental making. By working through a series of activities, both in and out-with the class, students will focus on developing a series of studies based on ideas, observations and insights which they will use to develop into more resolved works.The course will draw from some group and collaborative activities leading towards a focus on individual interests and personal projects. Over the course the students' progress will be monitored and supported by the tutor via presentations, practical demonstrations, one to one tuition, group discussions and critiques.For the necessary study hours, out with class contact time, students will be required to self-motivate their personal learning with direction provided in advance by the tutor. Directed study will include research into a range of suggested artists and associated movements to engender a contextual awareness. Students will be expected to demonstrate how their research has informed their work with particular attention given to the student's use of sketchbooks, photography and critical note-keeping from gallery visits and fieldwork.There will be an emphasis on keeping a Learning Journal throughout the course, which should provide a clear and continuous reflective record of any research, ideas and practical work, and a place to record and analyse any challenges experienced and reflect upon how they were addressed.The students will benefit from one to one tuition, and discussion in pairs and through group crits where they will be encouraged to talk about their work and the challenges faced. They will also be exposed to listening to the ideas of the other students and how to take on board and make constructive comments.Formative feedback will be offered by the course tutor to the student via their Learning Journals. On completion of the course, students will be required to meet the three learning outcomes.",

Each student will make their own simple piece of saw-pierced jewellery and a basic ring using these techniques. Research and development of design ideas will be taught to allow students to confidently design their own unique pieces, applying the skills they have learnt. These designs will then be made into individual student projects during the remainder of the course.Students will use various construction methods and be introduced to a variety of materials, such as copper, brass and silver.Outline of ContentThe course teaching is typically delivered over weekly class sessions of around 3 hours each and totaling 30 hours. Alternatively, the course can be delivered more intensely or as a block if required.Over the class sessions the course will cover:- Demonstration and practice of Saw-piercing, soldering and shaping- Look at and practice making a simple ring- Discussion of personal projects followed by experimentations and test pieces to develop ideas- Start production of personal project pieces- Continue working on personal project pieces- Finish work on personal project piecesThe Learning ExperienceThe teaching will be based and delivered in specialist art and design studios or workshops and will typically include a range of practical exercises, introductions to techniques, processes and concepts, and set projects which lead to more focused and personal exploration. Over the course, studentsÂ¿ progress will be monitored and supported by the tutor.  Teaching will include practical demonstrations, one to one tuition, group discussions and critiques.For work required to be undertaken after the class hours are complete, the course tutor will set students a 'directed study plan' which can be undertaken without the need for specialist workshops or access to models.Directed study will include research into a range of suggested artists and their associated movements to engender a contextual awareness.

An evolving sequence of life poses will be contextualized in the drawing studio to provide the student with a basic understanding of human anatomy to create a body of considered works, generated from a range of drawing approaches.Outline of ContentThe course teaching is typically delivered over weekly class sessions of around 3 hours each and totaling 30 hours. Alternatively, the course can be delivered more intensely or as a block if required.Over the class sessions the course will cover:- Introduction to the figure- Finding the figure in space through line.- Classical and contemporary, bridging the gap. Examining classical representations of the figure and the contemporary resonance.- Deconstruction- Identifying and defining bone structure and muscle through tone.- Load-The figure at rest. Volume and displacement. Measuring the figure.- Transition- The ecstatic figure in the moment.- Movement- The figure at work.- Expression- Investigating mark making and identifying key parts of the body as emotive signifiers. Head, hands and feet.- Rapid recording- time restricted drawing.- Embedding- drawing from memory.- Scaling up- developing the figure from thumbnail sketches and study drawings.- Beyond the framework- the figure in composition.The Learning ExperienceThe teaching will be based and delivered in specialist art and design studios or workshops and will typically include a range of practical exercises, introductions to techniques, processes and concepts, and set projects which lead to more focused and personal exploration. Over the course, students' progress will be monitored and supported by the tutor.  Teaching will include practical demonstrations, one to one tuition, group discussions and critiques.For work required to be undertaken after the class hours are complete, the course tutor will set students a 'directed study plan' which can be undertaken without the need for specialist workshops or access to models.Directed study will include research into a range of suggested artists and their associated movements to engender a contextual awareness. Students are expected to demonstrate how their research has informed their work through annotated sketchbooks, a visual digital journal and practical outcomes.The Directed Study Plan will include preparing evidence of research and practical work to form an appropriate presentation for assessment.",

Over the class sessions the course will cover:Introduction, basic studio etiquette and a look at materials.The portrait-what is it, who does it and why?Make several exploratory studies of the model.Using a range of hard and soft pencils to fully explore line and form to create drawings concentrating on proportion and structure of the head.  Looking at artist Dryden Goodwin's work.Tonal work using willow charcoal, compressed charcoal, putty rubber and white chalk to create form and depth, to almost ' sculpt' the head using drawing materials.Mixed media.Creating character and expression using a variety of drawing and painting materials; e.g. pastels, inks, oil bars, charcoal, pencil and acrylic paints, watercolours. We will look at works by David Hockney and Jim Dine.Painted portraits. Using paints, students will spend time learning how to mix colour for skin tones and working out composition in sketchbooks before moving on to scaling up onto card or canvas, blocking in areas of colour, building surface, adding detail, correcting and creating character.Develop brushwork and paint mixingSelf-portrait using a personal choice of materials and considering how other artists have approached this- e.g.Rubens, Rembrandt, Alice Neel and Lucien Freud.Make page(s) of investigations in sketchbook or paper- concentrated looking at particular areas of the head- an eye, an ear, the area from nose to top lip-this will reinforce your understanding of the anatomy of any 'problem areas'.Finish will informal group discussion and critique.The Learning Experience: The teaching will be based and delivered in specialist art and design studios or workshops and will typically include a range of practical exercises, introductions to techniques, processes and concepts, and set projects which lead to more focused and personal exploration. Over the course, student progress will be monitored and supported by the tutor. Teaching will include practical demonstrations, one to one tuition, group discussions and critiques.For work required to be undertaken after the class hours are complete, the course tutor will set students a 'directed study plan' which can be undertaken without the need for specialist workshops or access to models.Directed study will include research into a range of suggested artists and their associated movements to engender a contextual awareness. Students are expected to demonstrate how their research has informed their work through annotated sketchbooks, a visual digital journal and practical outcomes.The Directed Study Plan will include preparing evidence of research and practical work to form an appropriate presentation for assessment.",

Conservation and preservation over innovation. New imagery and a new dialogue: Museum of Scotland, Scottish Parliament, visitor centres etc., recent housing in Highlands.The course will be delivered in a series of illustrated lectures. In addition to exterior styles and some landscape design the course will also focus, where appropriate, on interior design, e.g. Robert Adam and C.R. Mackintosh.A core aim will be to consider how Scotland has maintained a distinctively Scottish architecture over all the time periods and influences. Students are encouraged to ask questions during the lectures but a time at the end of each evening will be allowed for wider discussion and questions. The students will be provided with an extensive reading list for essay preparation but there will also be a shorter recommended reading list for those not wishing to undertake detailed study.The course will include walks in the vicinity of the Royal Mile so that the class can benefit from viewing buildings at first-hand. This type of guided walk is particularly useful for demonstrating age characteristics, materials and scale. It is also a less formal learning experience that has proved extremely popular with COL students in the past.Students should be able to display the above learning outcomes through the essay submitted at the end of the course. Students' progress with these learning outcomes will also be assessed in the formative exercise (non-compulsory) mid-way through the course.",

    "course_description": "1) Academic DescriptionThe aim of this course is for students to understand and practise ways of transferring ideas and visual research into a series of personally ambitious and compelling paintings. The course investigates several ways of making these steps including ways of recording visual information in a sketchbook, how to investigate the paintings of other artists, exploring ways of applying paint, and implementing colour theory, composition and tonal design.The course is practical in nature with the emphasis on painting. The immersive nature of the course will provide an in-depth understanding of the iterative and experimental nature of creative practice as well as the practicalities of translating ideas developed in a sketchbook into resolved outcomes. To complement this there will be demonstrations of sketchbook use, mind-mapping and colour theory. There will also be frequent referrals made to the paintings of other artists and the opportunity for one-to-one, peer-to-peer and group critiques and discussions.2) Outline ContentThroughout the duration of this class students will gain practise and competency in developing ideas through painting. This will be supported through various exercises which will include:Â· Value of the sketchbookÂ· Generating ideas through the use of mind-mapsÂ· Investigating CompositionÂ· Employing a range of toolsÂ· Exploring collage and mono-printing techniquesÂ· Colour mixing and tonal designÂ· Working from the model (optional)Â· Working with limited palettesÂ· Gesture and layeringÂ· Working with coloured groundsÂ· Scaling-upStudents will work initially from still life and the model. Thereafter students will develop their own ideas with an emphasis on how to translate these ideas into visual outcomes. Studio practice will also be covered, including how to set up an efficient workspace, different ways of laying out a palette and cleaning up.3) Student Learning ExperienceThe contact hours of this course will be delivered in a fit-for-purpose art and design studio and will include a range of theoretical and contextual presentations and discussions. This course involves hands-on learning approaches with introductions to techniques, concepts and practical and experimental making.By working through a series of activities, both in and outwith the class, students will focus on developing a series of studies based on ideas, observations and insights which they will use to develop into more resolved works.The course will draw from some group activities leading towards a focus on individual interests and personal projects. Over the course the students progress will be monitored and supported by the tutor via presentations, practical demonstrations, one to one tuition, group discussions and critiques.For the necessary study hours, out with class contact time, students will be required to self-motivate their personal learning with direction provided in advance by the tutor. Directed study will include research into a range of suggested artists and associated movements to engender a contextual awareness. Students will be expected to demonstrate how their research has informed their work with particular attention given to the student's use of sketchbooks, photography and critical note-keeping from gallery visits and fieldwork.There will be an emphasis on keeping a Learning Journal throughout the course, which should provide a clear and continuous reflective record of any research, ideas and practical work, and a place to record and analyse any challenges experienced and to reflect upon how these were addressed.Students will be actively encouraged to investigate the work of other artists through looking at books brought into the studio and visiting the library themselves. There will be an emphasis not only on well-known historical and contemporary painters, but lesser-known artists who may be found through online platforms. Students will be prompted to attend exhibitions and record opinions from these and their reading in their Learning Journal as well as sharing with the class.Formative feedback will be offered by the course tutor to the student via their Learning Journals. On completion of the course, students will submit a portfolio of work ready for summative assessment. To pass students will be required to meet the three learning outcomes.",

Interpreting and constructing line within the woven structure to reveal the creative versatility of the woven mark. An exploration into the specific use of materials and choice of warp setting will increase the creative possibilities. Students will develop a sketchbook, a visual journal of research on a theme of line, which will inform their woven work.Outline of Content: The course teaching is typically delivered over weekly class sessions of around 3 hours each and totaling 30 hours. Alternatively, the course can be delivered more intensely or as a block if required.Over the class sessions the course will cover:Introduction - mark making in contemporary tapestryExperiment in line and mark-making through drawingDeveloping a research journal / sketchbooksWeaving the line.Experiments with warp and weft thicknessSurface lines / raised lineDirection and scale of weaveDeveloping a personal projectInterpreting designs for tapestryPresenting your workThe Learning Experience: The teaching will be based and delivered in specialist art and design studios or workshops and will typically include a range of practical exercises, introductions to techniques, processes and concepts, and set projects which lead to more focused and personal exploration. Over the course, student progress will be monitored and supported by the tutor.  Teaching will include practical demonstrations, one to one tuition, group discussions and critiques.For work required to be undertaken after the class hours are complete, the course tutor will set students a 'directed study plan' which can be undertaken without the need for specialist workshops or access to models.Directed study will include research into a range of suggested artists and their associated movements to engender a contextual awareness. Students are expected to demonstrate how their research has informed their work through annotated sketchbooks, a visual digital journal and practical outcomes.The Directed Study Plan will include preparing evidence of research and practical work to form an appropriate presentation for assessment.",

Classes will focus on close analysis of art from this period which saw significant changes in technique, style and subject matter. Throughout the course, students will consider changes such as the depiction of contemporary settings rather than traditional, schematic backgrounds, and the transition from rigid depictions of people to characters infused with emotion and interaction. These developments in art will be placed in the religious, political and cultural context of the time, looking in particular at the catalysts for change such as the Mendicant Orders' artistic and architectural patronage.Outline contentThis course will cover the following areas:- Nicola and Giovanni Pisano: ancient and modern- Cimabue: 'the renewal of painting'- Giotto: 'a great light eclipses a smaller one'- Giotto: 'sovereign master of painting'- The Mendicant Orders: facilitators of innovation- Duccio: innovation inspired by Greek and Byzantine tradition- Simone Martini: urban realism- The Lorenzetti brothers, Pietro and Ambrogio: anecdote and everyday life- Taddeo Gaddi, Giotto's most gifted pupil- Material CultureStudent learning experienceThe course will be taught by informal lecture and discussion. Students will be guided in close analysis of paintings and other works of art, and will be introduced to key concepts in the study of Art History at this level. Students taking the course for credit will receive guidance on how to present their art history essay, and will be able to discuss their assessment with the course tutor, through a formative assessment essay plan which leads directly to the final essay.",

Their masterpiece in the Cathedral of Pisa anticipated the shape of things to come2: Siena: favouring the elegant grace of the International Gothic style, the artists of Siena produced some of the most beautiful works of the 15th century. Sienese artists will include the Master of the OSSERVANZA and Il SASSETTA3: Naples: the adoption of the Netherlandish technique of oil painting marked a pivotal development in fifteenth-century Italian art and it was almost certainly in Naples that the method was first assimilated by the Italian painter, Antonello da MESSINA4: Venice: the artists of 15th century Venice were responsible for some of the most idiosyncratic paintings of the period. Works by the VIVARINI and CRIVELLI will be considered5: Venice: the monumental work of MANTEGNA and CARPACCIO6: Urbino: In his ducal palace in Urbino, the condottieri, Federico da Montefeltro attracted some of the most gifted artists of the day. His court worked like a laboratory bringing together a scholarly interest in the art of antiquity and a fascination with perspective and geometry. Artists considered will include Piero della FRANCESCA7: Florence: perhaps more than any other centre, the roots of Renaissance art can be traced to Florence and the work of BRUNELLESCHI, the architect of the dome of Florence Cathedral and MASACCIO, one of the first artists to employ linear perspective8: Florence: part 2, artists considered will include DONATELLO, GHIBERTI and Filippino LIPPI9: Florence: part 3, artists considered will include VERROCCHIO, BOTTICELLI and GHIRLANDAIO10: Rome: thanks to the princely patronage of Pope Sixtus IV, and the group of artists he commissioned to decorate his newly restored Sistine Chapel, the early Renaissance was established in Rome. These artists included PERUGINO, BOTTICELLI and GHIRLANDAIOStudents should be able to display the above learning outcomes through the essay submitted at the end of the course.

Students will be encouraged to take an experimental approach to playing with wire, Earrings, Rings, Bracelets and Necklaces will all be possible as well as more sculptural objects. Students will design and produce their own personal projects using the techniques they have learnt.Outline of Content: The course teaching is typically delivered over weekly class sessions of around 3 hours each and totaling 30 hours. Alternatively, the course can be delivered more intensely or as a block if required.Over the class sessions the course will cover:Demonstration and practice of manipulating and twisting wire, making jump rings, and soldering.Look at and practice making a simple ringDiscussion of personal projects followed by experimentations and test pieces to develop ideasTechniques needed to complete personal projects will be taught as required on a 1 to 1 basisProduction of personal project piecesThe Learning Experience: The teaching will be based and delivered in specialist art and design studios or workshops and will typically include a range of practical exercises, introductions to techniques, processes and concepts, and set projects which lead to more focused and personal exploration. Over the course, student progress will be monitored and supported by the tutor.  Teaching will include practical demonstrations, one to one tuition, group discussions and critiques.For work required to be undertaken after the class hours are complete, the course tutor will set students a 'directed study plan' which can be undertaken without the need for specialist workshops or access to models.Directed study will include research into a range of suggested artists and their associated movements to engender a contextual awareness. Students are expected to demonstrate how their research has informed their work through annotated sketchbooks, a visual digital journal and practical outcomes.The Directed Study Plan will include preparing evidence of research and practical work to form an appropriate presentation for assessment.",

With drawing as its foundation, the course aims to give students the confidence, passion and commitment to pursue their chosen degree pathway, whilst preparing students for progression to successful study of Access Art and Design 2. The course is project-driven with practical workshops that enable students to expand upon basic skills to experiment with materials, digital engagement and 2d/3d ideas relating to the students' expanding knowledge of contemporary art/design and cultural issues.",
    "course_description": "1) Academic DescriptionThis course is offered as part of the Access Programme (Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences). The Access Programme aims to prepare students for undergraduate study by introducing them to a range of essential skills and encouraging them to employ theseskills in a confident and flexible way.Semester 1 courses are designed to foster those skills which are broadly transferable within their respective disciplinary areas and are designed to prepare students for progression to semester 2.This, semester 1 course will provide an inclusive, supportive, stimulating and creative environment in which students are supported to create strong portfolios suitable for entry to the wide variety of art and design degree programmes (for example, Art, Intermedia Art, Painting, Photography, Sculpture, Fine Art, Animation, Fashion, Film & Television, Graphic Design, Illustration, Interior Design, Jewellery & Silversmithing, Performance Costume, Product Design, Textiles, etc.).The core focus of Access Art and Design 1 is in skills development and portfolio preparation, supporting each student to demonstrate their artistic ability and potential in relation to their chosen degree pathways. Students will be encouraged to identify their potential degree pathways at an early stage of the course so that their learning can be tailored effectively towards individual outcomes and tailored portfolios. In line with a student's application to ECA and the 'portfolio assessment criteria' (which can also be used to map on to other institutions submission applications) four key areas will be blended into the learning journey: enquiry and visual research; idea development and material/technical exploration; critical judgement, reflection and resolution; and contextual awareness.The course will include core skills-development workshops in a range of drawing and 2d/3d skills and techniques, visual recording, mixed-media experimentation and confidence building, digital engagement, and portfolio presentation along with enrichment activities to support progression. Work will be focussed around a themed project/ live brief which is designed to enable students to engage with, and demonstrate independent creative exploration and underpin their creative output and skills development.2) Course ContentThe course is designed around portfolio requirements for entry to degree courses in art and design.Each of the twelve practical studio sessions includes tutor input on a range of issues and approaches within contemporary art and design.  These sessions are designed to stimulate the students' work and provide greater depth to their portfolios.Evidence of drawing enquiry and visual research is a core requirement of all art and design degrees, so both primary observational and experimental 2d and 3d drawing forms the first half of Art and Design 1, through observation and photography in journals, sketchbooks and developing mixed-media work, along with emotive exploration. Students will be directed towards specific degree course preparation and additional digital training if this is required for progression. Thereafter the course is project-based, encouraging students to develop interest in ideas and engage with themes relating to their practical work, undertaking independent research and practice-led enquiry.The class project/live brief provides a broad theme around which students can structure work for their application portfolio, supported through individual and group tutorials and critiques. Students will be encouraged to become reflective thinkers and engage with digital learning, though the expansion of creative ideas between classes and weekly submission of individual digital portfolios.3) Student Learning ExperienceStudents will typically learn through weekly studio-based and site- specific practical enquiry in a creative and supportive environment.  Learning will be supported by short seminars of contemporary art/ design and cultural issues, in order to strengthen theoretical engagement with their practice. The seminars will take place weekly before each practical session. Whilst the course is structured towards the broad needs for all programmes of continued study, students will be encouraged to be reflective learners, and to work towards their chosen pathways through independent research, and journal and portfolio development.Students will submit five formative pieces of work linked to the learning outcomes for the course, in the form of physical and digital portfolios, along with one short presentation on their planned project work.Constructive feedback (both verbal and written) will be provided by the course tutor. Students will be encouraged to consider feedback and to respond to this in future work.No grades will be provided for individual pieces of work, but an overall indicative course grade will be given at the end of semester based upon participation, coursework and response to feedback.In addition to support and feedback at course level, all students on the Access Programme will engage via an online learning journal, where they will be prompted to reflect on their learning experience, feedback and progress and will receive personalised guidance and support from their Personal Tutor.Students will also participate in a range of cultural and social engagement activities which are intended to complement their studies, increase cultural capital, encourage engagement with peers and communities, and build a sense of belonging.",

Through studio-based one to one teaching, and consisting of short projects, field trips, workshops and talks, students will deepen and broaden their engagement between their ideas and studio practice.",
    "course_description": "1) Academic DescriptionArtists working today engage in many diverse forms of research, which are deeply embedded in their art practice and increasingly many artists are now undertaking practice-based doctoral studies. This course is designed to act as an introduction to how to establish and develop fundamentally self-directed, strategies for research that will deepen and strengthen the engagement of the student's art practice with subject areas of personal interest.The course is primarily intended for those part-time students who have had some previous foundation in an Arts based discipline or have completed and taken courses for credit and are now seeking to focus and deepen engagement with their art practice. Primarily the course explores visual research methodologies whilst the studio-based teaching will encourage students to develop their own abilities to research independently.Research as an integral component of art practice has the possibility of making innovative and imaginative connections with form and content. The results can take the form of visual representations that work towards developing the artist's own ideas and communicate these ideas to a wider audience in the form of artistic work so that they're an integral part of the artistic research process.Students studying on full-time courses within the University of Edinburgh can take this credit course, but this cannot be used or counted towards any degree they are studying.2) Outline ContentBased both in the studio and the field, the course will be based on a series of short projects involving visual, contextual and personal research created outside the studio and leading to the development of studio-based work. It will introduce research methods such as gathering and organizing research material and developing that material into project-based work together with recognizing experimentation with Process as a form of practice-based research.Students will be encouraged to engage with other artists, historical and contemporary, and other disciplines to broaden their awareness and where appropriate, visiting practitioners will engage with the students. Students will work individually and undertake a collaborative project to develop their communication and research skills. This will be reinforced by group discussion and critiques, and the work produced individually and collaboratively will form part of each student's summative assessment submission.The practical results arising from the projects need not take the form of finished artwork but should rather be seen as informing the process of what can be developed in the longer term in this way contributing to expanding students' art practice.Simple research tasks such as using a library effectively will be encompassed in addition to undertaking research drawing, object-based research, identifying and collating contextual material that is of interest to the student.3) Student Learning ExperienceThe course will mainly consist of short projects based on personal research, encouraging exploration and experimentation to develop the student's personal visual language.This will be supported by organized visits to exhibitions allowing for discussion and interaction with contemporary art. Talks and workshops with visiting artists will be used to widen the students learning experience and give practical encouragement to their personal development.In addition to formal assessments, regular group critiques will allow for a shared experience and enable the students to communicate their ideas visually and verbally to their peers.",

It will reinforce, to students, their own potency through reflection-in-action. The course purposefully targets the liminality between the academic and vocational.Over-arching theoretical concerns about professional graphic design practice are explicitly raised. These are: contemporary targeted mass communication; challenges and productivity of constraint; starting, doing and finishing. The themes are explored through substantial practical projects, encouraging students to iteratively form linkages between theory and practice.These theoretical areas are divided into practical questions, concerns and dilemmas around graphic practice, and introduce graphic industry-standard tools. The iterative template of learning and teaching emphasise the major themes of the course.Students studying on full-time courses within the University of Edinburgh can take this credit course, but this cannot be used or counted towards any degree they are studying.2) Outline ContentThe course has a tryptic of over-arching major thematic areas, each suggesting specific concepts:1)\tCONTEMPORARY TARGETED MASS-COMMUNICATIONExploring target-related practical concerns of audience, message, and medium.2)\tCHALLENGES & PRODUCTIVITY OF CONSTRAINTExploring constraint-related practical concerns of the client, platform, and resource.3)\tSTARTING, DOING AND FINISHINGExploring maker-related practical concerns of designer, process, and reflexivity.These are introduced in the first block of the course, then revisited through practice and reflection within each further block.Each later block of the course itself has a specific practical theme that introduces a related industry-standard professional design tool from the Adobe Creative Cloud suite:1)\tIMAGE & SEMIOTICFocusing on raster manipulation. This strongly infers the use of industry-standard Adobe CC Photoshop software.2)\tREPRESENTATION WITH POINT, LINE & PLANEFocusing on vector manipulation. This strongly infers the use of industry-standard Adobe CC Illustrator software.3)\tPUBLISHING & FLOWFocusing on a multi-page layout, flow and type-setting. This strongly infers the use of industry-standard Adobe CC InDesign software.This final block also consolidates the learning from the whole course by requiring practical use of raster and vector elements from previous explorations.3) Student Learning ExperienceThe course introduction will set a template for the core processes of graphic design:1)\tRESEARCHEvidenced through journaling and presentation.2)\tIDEATION & SELECTIONEvidenced through a body of sketches and presentation.3)\tITERATION & RESOLUTIONEvidenced through development from pitches, peer critique, tutorials, and 'client' presentation.The evidence from all three (journal, sketchbook, and resolved graphic designs) will be provided for both formative and summative assessments in accordance with established formal assessment points within the Centre for Open Learning.Students will initially research, develop, and resolve a graphic design that is a case study of a professional graphic design practitioner. This learning and teaching arc is echoed within each other block of the course, with parallel expectation of process, outcomes and evidence.The format of each later delivery block will be a separate practical project requiring the exploration of directed themes and issues through the use of professional industry-standard tools. Each project will be set through a 'client brief', with students provided 'client', peer and tutor feedback and academic guidance at key stages.",

    "course_description": "Academic Description: This course will allow students to develop their painting and mixed media practices to rigorously explore and sustain a focus for their own studio work, based upon a body of personal research, and underpinned by one-to-one and group critiques. Processes, materials and techniques will be determined by personal concerns, to evolve an independent visual language, and body of work, underpinned by a contextual awareness for historical and contemporary art practices.Outline of Content: The course teaching is typically delivered over weekly class sessions of around 3 hours each and totaling 60 hours. Alternatively, the course can be delivered more intensely or as a block if required.Over the class sessions the course will cover:Introduction to independent art practice in contemporary context.Suggested points of reference and short project.Multiples in miniatureSelf-directed projects startArtist studio visitMini CritiqueWorking larger and longerDeveloping larger workDeveloping work togetherFinishing work and group critiqueThe Learning Experience: The teaching will be based and delivered in specialist art and design studios or workshops and will typically include a range of practical exercises, introductions to techniques, processes and concepts, and set projects which lead to more focused and personal exploration. Over the course, student progress will be monitored and supported by the tutor.  Teaching will include practical demonstrations, one to one tuition, group discussions and critiques.For work required to be undertaken after the class hours are complete, the course tutor will set students a 'directed study plan' which can be undertaken without the need for specialist workshops or access to models.Directed study will include research into a range of suggested artists and their associated movements to engender a contextual awareness. Students are expected to demonstrate how their research has informed their work through annotated sketchbooks, a visual digital journal and practical outcomes.The Directed Study Plan will include preparing evidence of research and practical work to form an appropriate presentation for assessment.",

Individual dynasties will be examined against the growing influence of major European powers. We will also explore the political and economic transformation of these regional states and the cultural magnificence of their courts that was central to the identity of their rulers.The course will include lectures, seminar discussion and one-to-one discussion of the course and formative assessment to feedforward to the final assessment. Students will be introduced to a range of contemporary sources (history, literature, architecture, art) and will develop their critical analysis skills during lectures and group discussion.Content summary:1.\tThe State as a Work of Art: Introduce Jacob Burckhardt's work and the section on the evolution of the city-state. Introduce the northern states of the Italian peninsula and provide an overview of historical context and key events.2.\tThe Duchy of Milan: Political structures and power relations in Milan. The Visconti and the Sforza. Events during the Italian Wars (1494-1535). Imperial and Spanish Milan in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.3.\tSmall Principalities 1: Mantua.

With the German, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires in ruins, and Russia in the midst of revolution, Britain's position as the greatest world power of its day seemed yet further well-established.However Britain's resources had been sorely tested and, with the return to peace, social and economic challenges which had already been apparent before the war became steadily more pronounced. Growing industrial strife culminated in the General of Strike of 1926 and the economy plunged into depression with the onset of the worldwide slump in 1929.In India, which contained three quarters of the Empire's population, the nationalist movement was gaining in momentum, whilst similar developments, in Egypt, Palestine and elsewhere, were also testing Britain's resolve.Peace did not bring enduring stability to Europe and, with increasingly belligerent totalitarian governments in Germany, Italy and Japan, Britain was forced to come to terms with renewed tensions on the Continent and further afield.This course will examine the serious challenges that Britain faced, both at home and overseas, as it was forced to come to terms with its relative decline as a great power, against a backdrop of growing tensions in Europe and elsewhere.",

Introduction: Anatolia from 3000-1200 BC: This first session aims to familiarise students with the land of Anatolia, or modern Turkey: its topographic regions, resources, and general history. The main societies and cultures discussed in the course will be introduced, and a chronological timeline established.2. Anatolia at the Beginning of the Early Bronze Age: An introduction to the main cultures and cities of Anatolia in the Early Bronze Age and to the advent of metallurgy and its impact. What can the cemeteries of DemircihÃ¶yÃ¼k-Sariket and Yortan tell us about these early peoples? How did the early cultures in Anatolia differ from those of Mesopotamia and Egypt?3. The Royal Cemetery of Alaca HÃ¶yÃ¼k and the display of status and prestige: The thirteen 'Royal' shaft tombs found at Alaca HÃ¶yÃ¼k, a small Early Bronze Age and Hittite city near to Hattusha on the central plateau. The emergence of a social elite and how they command power and influence before writing or state-level organisation.4. The Assyrian Merchant Colonies period: The city of KÃ¼ltepe on the Kizilirmak river and its attached Assyrian Karum, or trading colony. Examination of Assyrian trading documents and of the motivations for the Assyrians to establish a trading colony.5. The Hittite Empire: The Hittites: their ethnic and linguistic origins, their writing, and their capital at Hattusha, high on the central Anatolian plateau. How did the Hittites rise to become a powerful contemporary to New Kingdom Egypt?6. Law Codes and Lawlessness: The Hittites were well known for their law code. But did they always conduct themselves with such careful moral attention? A look at the Hittites from the perspective of their military campaigns and their practices upon vanquished enemies.7. The Hittite Capital at Hattusha and the sanctuary at Yazilikaya: Using aerial photographs and extensive maps and plans, an exploration of the Hittite capital at Hattusha: its lower city and fortification walls, its upper citadel and Royal residence, its temples, tunnels, priests, a very confusing religious pantheon, and one very intrepid princess.8. Troy: from Early Bronze Age citadel to Late Bronze Age city of Wilusa: The city of Troy before the events of its classical fame: from the Early Bronze Age citadel and the correct dating of 'Priam's Treasures' to the controversy over Wilusa's role in the Hittiteopposing Assuwa League of the Late Bronze Age.9. The Coastal Mediterranean cities of Anatolia, from the Early to Late Bronze Age: Liman Tepe, Beycesultan, and Elmali- Karata. The evidence for cities in the west: early contact with neighbouring cultures, and evidence of their dramatic destruction at the end of the Late Bronze Age.10. Conclusions",

This will include the origins of the earliest art on earth, the transitions from stone to metal tools, the introduction of agriculture and the trends from mobile societies to sedentary lifeways. By studying a range of landscapes, sites and artefact evidence we will consider changes in cultures, technologies and settlement patterns from across Prehistory.4. Themes in Archaeology (1): homeThematic engagement with aspects of the subject, such as the topic of 'home', from prehistory to present, enables students to explore ranges of archaeological evidence. By using themes to investigate archaeological situations, the students will experience a range of locations around the globe and engage with different forms of evidence, to consider cultural practices, social change and archaeological methods.5. Themes in Archaeology (2): the everydayDeveloping on the previous week, we will consider a range of archaeological evidence that encompasses the 'everyday'. We shall focus on the things we take for granted, for example, toothbrushes, roads and mobile phones and discover how archaeology has developed practices to uncover the hidden biographies behind everyday objects. This will enable the students to consider how everyday objects from the past undergo a number of 'lives', and how everything has its own biography that can be traced from the raw materials used to create it, to its final act of disposal.6. World ArchaeologiesAn opportunity for students to explore their archaeology. This section will enable students to lead their own research into the archaeology of their homeland. During which they will consider the approaches taken by archaeologists in their countries and how they compare and contrast with other global examples.7. The Archaeology of the Industrial and Contemporary pastAn exploration of the world today and over the last 300 years provides us with a startling image of industrialisation. Through archaeology we explore the concept of the Anthropocene and how the practice of archaeology is developing to engage with the 20th and 21st centuries.8. Practising Archaeology todayBy visiting a range of landscapes, sites and museum archives, students will gain a range of experiences of how archaeology has been practiced in the past and how it is undertaken today. They will experience different landforms, consider how human activity has altered the landscape and how archaeology has developed different techniques to survey, investigate and analyse changing landscapes. Through site visits (where possible) they will experience how archaeological sites are presented to the public and by handling artefacts from museum collections they will experience the range of crafts that humans have developed.",

A short history of the British Empire3   'To have and have not': rich and poor in late Victorian Britain4   'Her Majesty's Government?': the Crown, Parliament and the political scene in late Victorian Britain5  'Gladstone versus Disraeli': differing approaches to challenges at home and abroad6  'Scramble for Africa': Imperial horizons from the Berlin Conference to the Boer War, 1878 to 19027  'Pomp and Circumstance': British attitudes toward the British Empire, 1880 to 19148  'A Most Superior Person': George Curzon and the challenges to the British Raj in India, 1899 to 19149  'Socialists, Suffragettes and Nationalists': political and social unrest in Britain and Ireland, 1900 to 191410  'Splendid Isolation' no more: changing foreign policy and the road to the Great War, 1900 to 1914At the end of the nineteenth century the British Empire covered roughly a quarter of the earth's surface. It was the biggest empire that the world had ever known. Backed by a navy that was by the far the largest in the world, and with an economy that remained one of the most advanced and productive, Britain appeared invincible. Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee of 1897 was used as a showcase both for the Empire and for Britain's status as the greatest world power of the day.However all was not as it seemed. The British economy was facing serious challenges from abroad, Germany and the United States in particular. There was growing labour unrest at home, and the nationalist movement in Ireland was becoming increasingly restive. As the new century began there were also the first signs of serious dissent in India, the so-called 'jewel in the crown' of the Empire. The Boer War of 1898 to 1902 did not provide the easy victories the British public had expected, and the brutalities inflicted on civilians caught up in that conflict provoked widespread condemnation.This course will examine the serious challenges that Britain faced, both home and overseas, during a period that is often portrayed as something of a golden age for Britain and the British Empire.The British Empire, both during its heyday and in its decline, has an enduring appeal for historians and the wider public. Books about the Empire, and about Britain during its rise and fall as a world power, such as Niall Ferguson's Empire: How Britain Made the Modern World (2003), have become best sellers. In recent years there have also been numerous television documentaries dealing with Empire related themes. This area would be a valuable and popular addition to the topics covered in the COL history syllabus.",

    "summary": "An introduction to the history and literature of ancient Greece and Rome, . This course will be based on the study of extracts in translation from key Classical authors, such as Virgil, Sophocles and Ovid. Students will gain an understanding of the texts studied and their cultural and historical significance, and will use the texts to ask questions about the politics, culture and society of ancient Greece and Rome. The course will encourage students to develop their skills of close source analysis and critical thinking.",
    "course_description": "This introduction to Classics begins with more accessible texts and themes, in preparation for more complex texts and ideas later in the course. For example, Ovid is a good introduction because his text is very accessible, yet introduces students to the subtlety and sophistication of ancient myth. This prepares students for the greater challenges which Sophocles presents at this level. Studying these authors gives a greater appreciation of the more expansive writing of Herodotus, and of the mythos - logos transition. In this way, it is possible for students more readily to discover for themselves the comparisons and contrasts between texts, within the confines of a 10-week, 10 credit course.The course will include lectures, seminar discussion and one-to-one discussion of the course and formative assessment to feedforward to the final assessment. Students will be introduced to a range of sources and will develop their critical analysis skills during lectures and group discussion.The course will cover the following topics:1. Introduction to Classics: the ancient world and its importanceWhat is \"Classics\"? What is its value and relevance to our culture and society in the twenty first century?2. Ovid: The Metamorphoses - selected storiesIntroduction to myth. How myth works, and its significance then and now.3. Sophocles: Oedipus the KingGreek tragedy and its enduring importance. The psychological and political significance of Oedipus the King.4. Aristotle and contemporary responses to Oedipus the KingHow tragedy works. The importance of tragedy in ancient Athens.5. Herodotus and the beginnings of HistoryThe transition from mythical understanding to rational understanding of the past. \"History\" and ethnography.6. Herodotus and the Second Persian Invasion of GreeceThe scale of Xerxes - Invasion; Spartan military culture and the Battle of Thermopylae.7. Virgil and the Epic Tradition/ The AeneidThe Homeric inheritance, and the importance of the Trojan War in Virgil's founding myth.8. Virgil's The Aeneid - Books 1-4The journey of Aeneas from Troy to Carthage.9. Introduction to Rome in the first century AD.Roman politics and society under Augustus and Tiberius.10.

The city was physically redesigned by the many 'improvement acts' and the coming of the railways. However, many of those who visited the city and who lived in it described it as both 'beautiful' and 'grotesque'. Edinburgh's Old and New Towns became more and more a reflection of the 'haves' and the 'have-nots'. Immigrants to Edinburgh found refuge in the city but not necessarily a welcome there.Students will examine the city from many angles, assessing the diverse and changing character of the city; placing it in the broader historical context of Scotland; and evaluating its place in Britain and Europe.

    "summary": "This course explores women in the social, cultural, religious, political and economic developments of early modern Italy. Focusing on a range of primary sources that highlight the roles of women in Italy at this time, students will consider the ideal and the reality of Renaissance woman, who was chaste, silent, and obedient.",
    "course_description": "'The Other Voice' is the title of a current series of translated works by women writers in early modern Italy (c.1300-1700), many of which are available through the university library. The course will introduce students to a number of key texts from the period calling for gender equality and equal education for women, but also to works in other genres, and where appropriate to the works of women artists in different genres. Each week we will explore a theme and the associated sources in order to throw light on the social, cultural, religious, political and economic developments in Italy and more broadly in Europe  during this period, and to question the existence of the 'ideal' woman who was chaste, silent, and obedient.Since the question 'Did women have a Renaissance?' was asked by Joan Kelly in 1977, a stream of research has led to a much clearer and more nuanced understanding of womenÂ¿s status in early modern Italy than previous historiography had argued. The course aims to introduce students to the historical background and to examine women's legal and social status, c.Â 1300-1700, by considering wide-ranging themes, ranging from education, commercial activities, marriage and divorce to childbirth and health. These topics will span a number of key groups across society: ruling consorts, noblewomen, merchants' wives, women in trade and domestic service, nuns, prostitutes and outcasts. The course will also consider the role of women in the religious controversies and wars of sixteenth-century Italy, as well as in performance and art. By analysing the patriarchal society of early modern Italy, changes and continuities in women's status will be highlighted and evaluated. Treatises and other works by women from this period have recently been published (and translated), enabling scholars to analyse how these authors self-fashioned themselves through such texts. It is also possible to compare these identities to the portrayal of women in male-authored works from the same period.",

This course will be based on the study of extracts in translation from key Classical authors, such as Virgil, Sophocles and Ovid. Students will gain an understanding of the texts studied and their cultural and historical significance, and will use the texts to ask questions about the politics, culture and society of ancient Greece and Rome. The course will encourage students to develop their skills of close source analysis and critical thinking.",
    "course_description": "This introduction to Classics begins with more accessible texts and themes, in preparation for more complex texts and ideas later in the course. For example, Ovid is a good introduction because his text is very accessible, yet introduces students to the subtlety and sophistication of ancient myth. This prepares students for the greater challenges which Sophocles presents at this level. Studying these authors gives a greater appreciation of the more expansive writing of Herodotus, and of the mythos - logos transition. In this way, it is possible for students more readily to discover for themselves the comparisons and contrasts between texts, within the confines of a 10-week, 10 credit course.The course will include lectures, seminar discussion and one-to-one discussion of the course and formative assessment to feedforward to the final assessment. Students will be introduced to a range of sources and will develop their critical analysis skills during lectures and group discussion.The course will cover the following topics:1. Introduction to Classics: the ancient world and its importanceWhat is \"Classics\"? What is its value and relevance to our culture and society in the twenty first century?2. Ovid: The Metamorphoses - selected storiesIntroduction to myth. How myth works, and its significance then and now.3. Sophocles: Oedipus the KingGreek tragedy and its enduring importance. The psychological and political significance of Oedipus the King.4. Aristotle and contemporary responses to Oedipus the KingHow tragedy works. The importance of tragedy in ancient Athens.5. Herodotus and the beginnings of HistoryThe transition from mythical understanding to rational understanding of the past. \"History\" and ethnography.6. Herodotus and the Second Persian Invasion of GreeceThe scale of Xerxes - Invasion; Spartan military culture and the Battle of Thermopylae.7.

We will cover topics such as national identity, wars and trade, the arts and education, affluence and oppression, industry and poverty. Students will develop research skills and an understanding of historical themes and concepts, while studying the history and context of this ancient and remarkable city.",
    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionThis intensive course uses the city of Edinburgh as a lens through which to study a broad range of historical themes and contexts, and to develop students' historical research and study skills. We will work closely with original written and material sources, including privileged access to some of the city's unique collections, and including evidence such as medieval manuscripts, objects in museums, historic buildings and paintings. Through these sources, we will look at the cultural, economic, social and political history of Edinburgh from the earliest known settlements to the present day, via classroom activities focused on nurturing student-led analysis and discussion of sources and key themes.Course ContentThe course will look at Edinburgh throughout its history, focusing on a particular theme for each time period. Starting with Iron and Bronze Age and Roman evidence, we will consider how evidence from earliest records can be used before moving on to explore the making of a city and kingdom in the medieval period. The course will cover Edinburgh's genesis into a capital city, and centre of trade, arts and also conflict; the development of the New Town will be considered along with influence of Georgian grandeur, empire and slavery. We will examine Edinburgh's role as a centre for education and the Enlightenment, along with the contrasting affluence and poverty accompanying industrial development. The course will finish by considering Edinburgh in recent times, home of the Scottish Parliament and renowned for its summer festivals, as we discuss ideas of independence and culture, and what makes a city's identity today.Student Learning ExperienceThe course will be taught in the classroom and on fieldtrips to city museums, galleries, libraries and historic sites. Students with mobility issues or additional needs should make the Centre for Open Learning aware so that arrangements can be made. Wherever possible, we will choose venues that are wheelchair accessible. Teaching will be a combination of informal lecture, large- and small-group discussion, and expert input at city collections. Students will be expected to prepare for each class with specific focus on a secondary or primary source, including physical and digital resources. Participants will engage actively in learning by preparing source analyses to be presented in class or submitted via discussion forum. These exercises will provide feedback to be fed forward for the final assessment.",

As contemporary narratives for the study of seventh century Arabia, where Islam developed, and of the Late Roman empire are scarce, students will be able to tackle the methodologies put forward by historians to reconstruct the events of this period. Texts in a variety of languages (Greek, Arabic, Syriac, Coptic, Armenian, Georgian, Persian) as well as documentary (papyri, coins, seals, inscriptions, graffiti) and archaeological sources will be utilized in the seminars.The course will consist of a 2-hour seminar each week. Students will learn to engage critically with both the latest research in the field and the primary source material in translation or in the original language depending on their linguistic expertise. Each week a different compulsory reading (primary or secondary source) will be assigned to each student or to a group of students, to be read in advance and discussed in class.

For each text we  shall examine the presentation of Edinburgh, and consider how the city may have influenced the creation of the text. Where possible, we shall examine contextual information to explore the part these texts have played in shaping Scottish Literature more generally,  but also how they reflect the cultural distinction of Edinburgh.From the outset, we shall examine both literary texts and other materials such as journalism and correspondence, locating the authors within the city's cultural and historical context. Discussion of  the work of Robert Louis Stevenson will expose one of the key themes of the course, that of 'duality'.  Students will be asked to continue to consider the theme of duality and also that of frailty as we consider the writings of  short-term residents of Edinburgh: Robert Burns, Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen. Students will be asked to consider the enduring appeal of their poems, and the social and political critiques they present.Muriel Spark's classic exploration of the duality of Edinburgh, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, will be examined in detail, looking at  Spark's heritage in the city, as well as exploring how the novel invites discussion about the Scottish psyche.Students will be asked to examine Edinburgh  as a backdrop to detective fiction through modern texts such as Kate Atkinson's Case Histories, and consider how urban poverty and crime is portrayed in Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting. We shall compare and contrast  Welsh and Burns' use of language,  paying careful attention to the link between identity and language.We shall read a selection of poetry from 20th and 21st Century poets who have helped shape the literary scene in Edinburgh and beyond, and consider the contribution the  Scottish Poetry Library has made to Edinburgh's cultural landscape.  Students will be encouraged to apply close-reading skills and will be given support and advice on using poetic terms where appropriate.Students will be asked to read and watch examples of Scottish stage plays such as  Sue Glover's play Bondagers which explores rural life for woman in the mid-nineteenth century, and Gregory Burke's play Black Watch which dramatises the lives of soldiers from the Black Watch regiment in the 2004 Iraq conflict. The importance of theatre and the Edinburgh Festivals to the city will be considered as we review the contemporary responses by audiences and critics to the plays.Mid-way through each term, students will be introduced to close-reading exercises, during which they will be offered guidance on literary terminology and devices. Throughout the course, both in formative and summative assessment and also in group discussion, students will be encouraged to identify literary devices and refer to them using recognised literary terminology, so as to develop an academic vocabulary.The course will be taught in a small seminar setting, where participation will be supported and encouraged. The course comprises 20 two-hour classes plus approx. 160 hours of individual study.",

We shall consider the importance of the city of Edinburgh, the world's first UNESCO designated city of literature, in shaping the country's literary landscape. We shall read a wide variety of texts from the 19th Century to present day and consider the common themes which emerge.",
    "course_description": "The course will explore a range of texts inspired by, or written in, Edinburgh. For each text we shall examine the presentation of Edinburgh and consider how the local setting may have influenced the development of the text. From the outset, we shall examine literary texts as well as other materials, locating the authors within the country's cultural and historical context. Initial discussion of Muriel Spark's The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie will expose one of the key themes of the course: that of 'duality'. Students will be asked to continue to consider this theme as we explore the writings of other long and short-term residents of Edinburgh as well as those who have been inspired in different ways by the city.The course will be taught in a small seminar setting, where participation will be supported and encouraged.",

    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionThe course aims to improve oral fluency and confidence in speaking English through a variety of activities including participating in meeting roleplays; preparing and giving short talks; exchanging information about business situations; negotiating and participating in a simulated job interview. Writing activities focus on business correspondence (both letter and email) and writing reports. There is a general emphasis on the development of written and spoken communication skills. A range of materials from business and business media sources will be used to present and discuss aspects of business in both the UK and internationally. Throughout the course students will be encouraged to talk about their own knowledge and experience.Outline ContentThe tasks are predominantly based on authentic business texts. Most tasks involve an integration of two or more language skills and are presented within a business topic-based syllabus framework that includes business numeracy, types of business organisation, marketing and finance in order to introduce vocabulary and conceptual knowledge so that students can talk meaningfully in English about aspects of business. Students will research a business-related topic with the aim of giving a presentation of that topic to their colleagues at a simulated business conference at the end of the course.Student Learning ExperienceThe course is classroom-based with intensive small group and whole class discussion of topics. The aim is to provide a safe environment for L2 speakers to actively participate in such discussions. Students will be expected to prepare for class in advance (via access to online resources of reading for example) to maximise time spent on interactive activities in class. Students will also be expected to produce work in the form of written correspondence and reports, and to produce presentations, both live and recorded.

    "course_description": "1) Academic DescriptionELTEM provides opportunities to carry out in a supported environment academic tasks typically required on the TESOL and Language Education taught masters programmes.Classes will focus on each language skill in an integrated, cyclical, topic-based approach; a specialist topic (theme) will underpin each week of the course.  Academic writing classes will focus on genres common in the discipline of language teacher education, highlighting and practising features such as synthesising sources, developing arguments, voice and criticality; using a discourse analysis approach with examples from texts from the field.  In the lecture listening strand, students will listen and respond critically to lecture content; and seminar and discussion classes will raise awareness and practice skills necessary for participation.  Seminar and discussion class topics will arise from the lectures, as well as from the reading skills and strategies strand of the course.   In the reading strand, students read and take notes from journal articles and respond critically to their content.  Presentation skills classes will highlight and practise presentation features, developing confidence and speaking skills, similarly drawing on weekly topics.  These strands will prepare students for the course assessments.  A formative (non-assessed) strand of the course involves students working with a partner/group to research, prepare and present a paper at a conference in the final week of the course, and respond to questions; attending colleagues' presentations and responding with questions.2) Outline ContentWork on academic writing involves classes and materials offering advice and practice on structuring sections of the target text, synthesising and citation practices, argumentation and criticality and expressing students' own voice and stance.  Classes are collaborative and formative feedback is provided by course tutors on sections and a full draft of the assignment.The reading skills and strategies classes will run in parallel and in conjunction with the writing strand.  These classes help students develop efficient reading skills through discovering and sampling a range of academic texts such as article sub-genres and book chapters in the field.  There will be a focus on strategy awareness-raising and practice, as well as noticing text features also highlighted and practised in the writing strand.Speaking skills will be practised and developed in both the seminar and discussion skills classes and the presentation skills classes.  Topics explored in the reading strand will be exploited to develop a variety of relevant public speaking and collaborative skills. Students will work on practicing presentations and will both give and receive peer feedback.Listening skills and strategies necessary for programmes will be developed in the guest lectures strand, as well as further exploring and expanding conceptualisation of topics.  Lectures will also provide material to discuss, linking with the speaking strand of the course.The final week will focus on research skills and collaborative groupwork by students preparing and presenting conference papers on a topic of their choice within the discipline of language teacher education.  The conference itself simulates an academic conference with a programme of concurrent sessions (divided by topic into distinct threads) from which students select the sessions they would like to attend.These strands combine to prepare students for their summative assessments in listening, reading, writing and speaking; and ultimately for their programmes at MHSES.3) Student Learning Experience (approx. 100 words)The course is delivered by academic specialists in English Language Education: the course organisers who are responsible for the operational management of the course; course tutors, who work directly with classes; and subject specialist lecturers (principally from Moray House School of Education and Sport) who provide lectures on topics related to language and language teaching of relevance and interest to students embarking on postgraduate studies in these fieldsAfter orientation day, students have 2 x 1.5-hour sessions each day with tutor(s) over 6 weeks and there is also flipped content, which students can work on individually or in groups, drawing on peer and tutor support.",

It is for international/overseas students wanting to improve their academic English skills inpreparation for entry to language-related postgraduate degree programmes, usually within Moray House School of Education, CAHSS, University of Edinburgh.",
    "course_description": "1) Academic DescriptionThis pre-sessional EAP course forms the third and final course of ELE's suite of Pre-sessional courses. It is one of five final English for Specific Academic Purposes courses for international students who have either completed EAP2 or who have already met the English language requirement and hold unconditional offers for a postgraduate degree (normally PGT) programme at the University of Edinburgh. ELTAL is the appropriate course for students proceeding to Masters in TESOL and Language Teaching.ELTAL provides opportunities to carry out in a supported environment academic tasks typically required in the aforementioned taught masters programmes: selecting and evaluating academic sources in the composition of a written assignment comprising a critical review of a journal article of the student's choice, using peer and tutor feedback on a first draft to produce a revised final draft; preparing and delivering a 10-minute individual oral presentation based on the article selected for critical review, and handling questions; listening to other students' presentations, responding with questions, and providing peer feedback; listening to and taking notes from lectures and responding critically to their content in discussion; reading and taking notes from journal articles and book chapters, and responding critically to their content in discussion; and working with a partner or group to research, prepare and present a paper at a morning-long conference on the final day of the course, and respond to questions; attending colleagues' presentations at said conference and responding with questions.All Pre-sessional students undertake three summative assessments during the course: Reading-into-Writing, in the form of an 1800 word source-based written assignment; Speaking, in the form of a ten-minute individual oral presentation to the class followed by Q&A; and Listening in the form of a short dictation test.Key aims of the Pre-sessional courses are the development of student autonomy and transferability of the skills taught to the students' future study contexts.2) Outline of ContentWork on academic writing involves classes and materials offering advice on structuring the sections of the target text, citation practices, argumentation and criticality, and documentingreferences. Students write up the assignment over three weeks outside of class time, and receive formative feedback on a complete first draft before writing up the final draft in semi-exam conditions, supervised by class tutors before submitting it electronically for summative assessment.Following from the work in EAP2, class work on Presentation Skills is provided, based on further material adapted from Study Speaking by Kenneth Anderson, Joan Maclean and Tony Lynch (Cambridge University Press, 2004), in preparation for the summatively assessed Individual Presentations during weeks 2-4.The Guest Lectures involve the lectures themselves, in which students take notes and are encouraged to ask questions, and follow-up tutor-led classes where students compare their notes, evaluate their performance in following the lecture and discuss issues relating to the content.Students take practice listening tests prior to the formal listening assessment (a short dictation test) which takes place in Week 3.In the final week, students work in pairs/groups to research, prepare and present conference papers on a topic of their choice related to language / language teaching / language and culture. The introductory session includes a brief introduction to research methods. The conference itself simulates a 'real' conference, with a programme of concurrent sessions (divided by topic into distinct threads) from which students select the sessions they would like to attend. Staff from MHSE who will be working with the students on their Masters programmes are invited to attend.3) Student Learning ExperienceThe course is delivered by three groups of staff: a course director and a deputy course director, who are responsible for the operational management of the course; course tutors, who work with two classes of up to fourteen students; and guest lecturers (principally from Moray House School of Education) who give lectures on topics related to language and language teaching of relevance and interest to students embarking on postgraduate studies in these fields.After an orientation morning, students spend most of each teaching day in class groups with tutors, practising academic language and skills and receiving feedback, and discussing the Guest Lectures and selected readings. Each class group has two tutors, one for the academic writing component and for Group Project preparation, and one for Presentation Skills, Guest Lectures and topic-based Reading sessions. There are also four Guest Lectures.Students receive written formative feedback on the first draft of their Written Assignment, and peer and teacher feedback on practice presentations, and formal summative assessment of their final Written Assignment submission and performance in their Individual Presentation.Each student participates in one small group tutorial with their class tutor, to discuss their progress and how they can address their continuing needs to develop their academic English skills.There is a further lecture providing information about services offered by EUSA.",

    "summary": "Through this course we shall study a selection of novels written in the 1980s, exploring some of the key issues of the decade such as materialism, race, and duty.  We shall examine newly translated literature from Latin America and consider its impact on literary culture, as well as exploring the way writers address societal changes, especially in relation to sexuality and the role of women in society.",
    "course_description": "A student on this course can expect to explore key examples of fiction written in the 1980s. Although on the surface a decade seemingly defined by materialism, the fiction of this period is surprisingly diverse. Beginning with Jay McInerney's 1984 novel, Bright Lights, Big City, we shall consider the impact of materialism and hedonism, exploring the narrator's growing understanding of the vacuity of his position in society. Through Alice Walker's The Color Purple, we shall think about sexuality and Walker's depiction of the African American experience in the South. Walker's use of the epistolary structure as well as her shocking depictions of sexual violence will allow us to evaluate the reception  fiction received at this time, and ask why this novel was considered so controversial. Gabriel Garcia Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera will inspire discussion about the importance of translated fiction during this decade and the impact of forms such as magical realism on writers outside Latin America. Kazuo Ishiguro's The Remains of the Day will continue our discussions on love and duty while also evaluating the role of the historical novel in this decade. Ishiguro's novel seems far removed from the materialism that drove the 1980s, but its engagement with the war and the driving factors of business on post-war British society link to concerns of its contemporary society. Our final novel is Angela Carter's Nights at the Circus which pushes the boundaries of the novel with its complex notions of time and interactions with literary conventions such as the fairytale and narration. Carter's penultimate novel is key to understanding issues of gender in fiction and caused some controversy when its approach was described as 'post-feminist'.Lectures will provide a contextual overview of each novel, followed by a guided discussion on themes, characterisation, plot and narrative style. The course will be taught in a small seminar setting, where participation will be supported and encouraged.",

In speaking, students will be introduced to oral presentation skills and will continue to learn how to use effective and independent communication skills in a variety of contexts. There will be a continued focus on critical thinking at UK universities and students will be encouraged to take a position in relation to arguments.

Students will be taught in small groups. They will be expected to work in a number of ways and discussion tasks - where students are expected to speak and give their views - will be frequent and form a key role in developing their interactive speaking skills in an academic context.Students will be assessed via the following assessments, which relate to the learning outcomes (LOs of the course)AssessmentPractice Oral Presentation\t(Formative) - LOs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5Oral Presentation (35%) - LOs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5Weekly/bi-weekly Vocabulary Quizzes (20%) - LO1Source-based essay (2000 words) (45%) - LOs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5The course is designed to allow students to respond to new learning they acquire as they progress through.

Focusing on the construction of gender identity, sexuality, and gender norms in literary texts from Shakespeare to Angela Carter, with a focus on LGBTQ+ narratives, the course maps major developments in gender, sexuality and queer studies.",
    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionHistorically and in the present, gender and sexuality have been constructed and maintained through social norms and restrictions. While heteronormative and patriarchal cultures have insisted on prescribed gendered roles, individuals have found ways to subvert these norms. Meanwhile, feminist, gender and sexuality studies have examined the ways in which gender roles are constructed. This course examines the centrality of gender and sexuality in the discussion of literature and culture across space and time. Focusing on the construction of gender identity, sexuality, and gender norms in literary texts from Shakespeare to Angela Carter, with a focus on LGBTQ+ narratives, the course maps major developments in gender, sexuality and queer studies. Themes covered include theories of gender, modern and earlier notions of sexuality, same-sex desire and identity, transgender narratives, gender fluidity and utopian forms of gender, transgressive sexualities, stories of pain as well as of love, the relationship between gender, sexuality and the literary genre, and literary responses to gender constructions. By the end of the course students will have knowledge of key topics in gender, sexuality and feminist studies, and of the central role of gender and sexuality in literary works. They will be able to identify past and current attitudes toward aspects of gender and sexuality through literary representations, and to identify ways in which gender roles and sexual norms are constructed or deconstructed. They will be able to apply concepts of gender and sexuality in analysing literary texts, and to communicate and express ideas referring to these terms.Outline Content:Students on the course will read a selection of literary texts exploring gender and sexuality. Early modern notions of gender and desire will be explored through Shakespearean drama, while modern notions of gender and sexuality will be studied through Oscar Wilde's The Portrait of Dorian Gray. Gender fluidity, transgender and non-binary identities will be explored though reading Virginia Woolf's Orlando and Leslie Feinberg's Stone Butch Blues, while the construction and challenging of gender and sexual norms will be examined through Angela Carter's fairy tales. Utopian notions of gender, gender identity, and sexuality will be presented in Ursula K. LeGuin's The Left Hand of Darkness and Janelle MonÃ¡e's Dirty Computer, while feminist theories on the healing power of love and community, and resistance to oppression, will be studied through texts by Audre Lorde, Tony Kushner, and Chinelo Okparanta. Alongside discussion of specific literary texts, students will be introduced to key concept within the field of gender and sexuality studies, and to the relation between feminist theory and gender and sexuality studies. Literary texts will be placed within their social and historical contexts, and the mini-lectures will serve to introduce historical and contemporary theories of gender and sexuality through which to approach the texts. Students will thus be asked to consider the role of literature in formulating experiences of gender and sexuality, and to consider the relationship between history and the development of theories of gender and sexuality.Student Learning Experience:Through mini-lectures and supportive seminars, this course will give students the opportunity to read and discuss a range of fiction and non-fiction texts, as well as introducing literary theory based on feminist theory and gender and sexuality studies. Attention will be given to political, historical, social and cultural contexts. Students will be given introductory lectures on each text/author and will be asked to participate in group discussion, and be given the opportunity to deliver a short presentation. With guidance, students will identify literary devices through the close reading of excerpts and be encouraged to use recognised literary critical methodologies in their analysis of texts.",

Through this course we shall explore key examples of detective fiction written by women authors and/or featuring a female detective including Wilkie Collins' first female sleuth Valeria Brinton in The Law and the Lady, Christie's Miss Marple and Margaret Atwood's twist on the genre, Alias Grace.

    "course_description": "A student on this course can expect to explore key examples of detective fiction written by women authors or featuring a female detective. We shall examine the role played by women in the development of the genre and consider how women contribute to the diversity within it. Beginning with Wilkie Collins' Valeria Brinton, we shall consider  how Collins uses the constraints of Victorian society to develop his detective's motivation to solve a mystery. Through Agatha Christie's Miss Marple, we shall explore the important role played by women writers in the so-called Golden Age of detective fiction. This will lead us on to discuss developments in the genre, discussing the presentation of violence in Val McDermid's serial killer novel, The Mermaids Singing. From McDermid, we move on to consider Margaret Atwood's exploration of the crime genre with her historical novel, Alias Grace. We shall discuss how Atwood presents 'evil' and consider the significance of a female murderer  to the structure of the novel as a whole. Our final detective, Jane Tennison began life for most people on the television and so we shall consider how this character is presented in text,  but also how she fits into the police procedural ,and what she reveals about British society and policing at this time.Lectures will provide a contextual overview of each novel, followed by a guided discussion on themes, characterisation, plot and narrative style. The course will be taught in a small seminar setting, where participation will be supported and encouraged.",

Students will read a selection of Gothic literature, spanning over 200 years, and will be asked to explore the key elements of the genre and examine the ways in which the genre has developed.",
    "course_description": "The course will begin by tracing the roots of Gothic writing in the late 18th-century, considering and examining the fascination with cultural modes that pre-date the Age of Enlightenment (including ancient mythologies, paganism and Medieval and Renaissance Christianity). After studying an example of 18th-century Gothic fiction, we shall examine the mainstream of 19th-century Gothic fantasy, both in its early Romantic incarnation and in its later Decadent phase. We shall then examine some late 20th-century 'genre fiction', and conclude by considering examples of the Postmodern Gothic written in the early 21st-century. Throughout the course, we shall consider and evaluate the influence Gothic literature has on other forms of popular culture (film, TV, visual art, music, etc.), and on other genres such as horror and fantasy.Through mini-lectures and tutorial discussion, students will be asked to consider the key elements, motifs, literary devices and stylistic characteristics of Gothic texts, and compare and contrast the use of these across the breadth of the reading list. In doing so, students will develop skills in close reading, critical analysis, academic writing and will gain confidence in sharing their ideas aloud during guided tutorial discussion. Students will be encouraged to read widely, and to use appropriately scholarly secondary reading and an awareness of contemporary responses to the texts to inform their discourse. Students will be asked to read the texts independently, and to then engage with them deeply through close-reading activities during class hours. Tutor-led discussion will take place in a supportive tutorial atmosphere. At each stage, students will be introduced to examples of film, music and visual art influenced by the Gothic genre, and be asked to consider the texts in their broader cultural context.",

Writing activities focus on legal correspondence and writing case briefs and summaries. There is an emphasis on the development of vocabulary and reading skills. A range of materials from legal textbooks, case reports and newspaper articles will be used to present aspects of the legal system in the UK.Throughout the course students will be encouraged to talk about their own legal systems. The tasks are predominantly based on authentic legal texts. Most tasks involve an integration of two or more language skills and are presented within a legal topic-based syllabus framework. UK legal topics, including Tort/Delict; Civil and Criminal law; Constitutional law; Company law; Contract law and International law, mirroring the syllabus for a typical UK undergraduate law programme, are focussed on in order to introduce vocabulary and conceptual knowledge so that students can talk meaningfully in English about aspects of their own legal systems. Students will visit the Scottish Courts and the Scottish Parliament and carry out a Law Library based research task resulting in giving an oral summary of a UK legal case to their colleagues. The course culminates in a law conference at which each participant gives a presentation in English on a legal topic.",

We shall consider winners of prizes such as the PEN/Faulkner, Pulitzer, National Book Award, Whitbread and the Commonwealth First Novel and evaluate how literary value is ascribed and how much influence ordinary readers might have on the awarding of literary prizes and the influence of commercial value. In the final session, we shall compare all the novels we have read from this year and decide which is our book of the year.Students on this course will read five novels which were awarded literary prizes in 2001. Through lectures and seminar discussion, students will explore the key themes and stylistic characteristics of each novel and develop skills in close reading, critical analysis, using and interpreting secondary reading and writing an academic piece of work. Students will engage with the texts through excerpts for close reading, chosen by the tutor, in a supportive tutorial atmosphere. Through our reading of Philip RothÂ¿s The Human Stain, we will explore the role of political correctness in American morality and how race is explored in language. The Whitbread Prize will draw our focus to one of the important publishing phenomena of this period, the simultaneous publication of childrenÂ¿s and adultsÂ¿ versions of the same text, in this case, Philip PullmanÂ¿s final book in the His Dark Materials Trilogy: The Amber Spyglass. We will explore how a text is affected when it is awarded a prize like this and how the novel works for both adult and child readers. Michael ChabonÂ¿s Pulitzer Prize winning The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay will allow us to investigate the importance of comic books in a post-war world and how the stories created by Kavalier and Clay allow them to negotiate a world in which they encounter fear and prejudice. From the Pulitzer we will move on to consider Jonathan FranzenÂ¿s National Book Award winning novel The Corrections. This novel expresses the anxiety of a family on the cusp of personal and national change as Franzen measures a pre-9/11 American society moving away from the 90s tech boom to new ways of thinking. Our final novel will be Zadie SmithÂ¿s debut novel, White Teeth which won the Commonwealth WritersÂ¿ First Book Prize. We will be thinking about issues of immigration and roots as well how Smith uses multiple narrative viewpoints to discuss multiculturalism from a number of perspectives. Throughout the course we shall be discussing issues such as literary value, commercial value, readability and above all, how useful literary prizes are in the way in which we determine literary merit. We will try to draw out consistent themes between these authors and their texts all published in 2001 and identify how the public responded to their wins. In our final session of the course we will compare all the texts on the course and try to establish some criteria to decide which is our best book of the year. The course comprises ten two-hour classes plus approx. 80 hours of individual study.",

    "course_description": "Week 1 Martin Scorsese: The Rage Within. One critic believed Martin ScorseseÂ¿s regular actor Robert de Niro brought something new and dangerous to American cinema. We will explore how director and actor venture into the underbelly of American life in Taxi Driver and other key films.Week 2 Robert Altman: Attending to the Periphery. No filmmaker before Robert Altman gave so much attention to the details. From McCabe and Mrs Miller to Nashville, Altman was the great American director of the peripheral elements that create atmosphere without being forced to serve the plot.Week 3 Alan J. Pakula: Architecture and Paranoia.In Klute, The Parallax View and All the PresidentÂ¿s Men, Pakula gave visual form to private fears. We will explore how the director captured an America where power seemed to be everywhere and nowhere.Week 4 Hal Ashby: The Contempory Malaise. Whether dealing with a Â¿68 election campaign in Shampoo in his mid-seventies, Shampoo, or concentrating on a returning paraplegic Viet Vet and his affair with the wife of an army officer in Coming Home, Ashby proved a great director of the emotional minutiae of the period.,Week 5 Arthur Penn: Reinventing Genre. Penn had such a hit with Bonnie and Clyde that he became a director who could pick and choose. Yet he often worked in genre Â¿ in Little Big Man, Night Moves and The Missouri Breaks Â¿ but, as weÂ¿ll show, in a way that respected the characters and the situations more than genre conventions.Week 6 Terrence Malick: The Lyrical Mode. A great director of visual space, MalickÂ¿s films moved slowly even in a decade where so many films eschewed narrative purpose. We will look a the visual precision of his two seventies films, Badlands and Days of Heaven.Week 7 Milos Forman: The InsiderÂ¿s Outsider Forman was one of a number of Ã©migrÃ© filmmakers who came to the States and managed to combine a foreign mindset with a counter cultural sensibility. Paying especial attention to One Flew Over the CuckooÂ¿s Nest, weÂ¿ll show how seventies American cinema seemed able to absorb an outsiderÂ¿s perspective whilst still allowing Forman to make a very American film.Week 8 Steven Spielberg: Recuperating at the Box-Office. Like George Lucas, Spielberg was a filmmaker who was always more likely than most to adjust to changing times. Less a product of seventies America and all its attendant problems, Spielberg was  director with one eye on the audience, and adjusted better than most to the eighties as the cultural expectations shifted.Week 9 Francis Ford Coppola: The Hyperbolic Auteur: Few filmmakers were more ambitious than Coppola. In the two Godfather films and Apocalypse Now Coppola made the studio a fortune initially, and then looked like he might cost them a fortune when his Vietnam epic went way over-budget. Here weÂ¿ll explore perhaps the grandest of seventies auteurs.Week 10 Woody Allen: Comedy on the Couch. Pyschoanalysis was hardly new to cinema when Woody came along, but no filmmaker managed to incorporate it into the everyday lives of his characters, and to gain so much humour out of such unavoidably neurotic characters and situations.",

You will focus on writing skills (common features of UK scientific academic style, clearly describing a process), speaking skills (delivering an oral presentation, communicating in an academic discussion), reading skills (recognising genre, critically evaluating sources), along with listening and notetaking skills. There is also a reflective element of the course, in which you are encouraged to reflect on your learning progress week by week.PUGS provides extensive opportunities for you to work in small groups with peers and English Language Education teachers. This academic language and literacies course is classroom-based and incorporates intensive small group and whole class activities. There will be short independent study tasks each week.  Furthermore, you will participate in 1:1 tutorials with your class tutor to discuss your progress. Additionally, you will receive written and spoken formative feedback and feedforward from both tutors and peers; you will also have ample opportunities for developing transferable skills and autonomous learning strategies. At various stages of the course, you will undergo formative assessment aimed at preparing you for success in your further studies.",

It is designed to prepare students for the transition into UK Undergraduate study and to assist in the development of their academic English skills. PUGS 1 is run in collaboration with CSE. Schools of Engineering, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biosciences, Geosciences, and Informatics provide input concurrently with PUGS 1.",
    "course_description": "1) Academic DescriptionThis pre-sessional EAP course is specifically for students on the Undergraduate 2+2 programme. Students complete the first two years of their degrees in China, and the final two years in Edinburgh. Students are awarded an Undergraduate degree from the university of Edinburgh. Schools involved in the 2+2 programme are Engineering, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biosciences, Geosciences, and Informatics. The course is essential for students on the 2+2 programme who have yet to achieve the English language requirements set out by their Schools.PUGS 1 provides opportunities to develop academic skills typically required on their programmes in CSE: selecting, evaluating and using academic sources in a written assignment in the students' specialist field; developing their awareness of academic vocabulary and register for use in writing; researching, preparing and delivering a 10-minute individual oral presentation on a topic within the student's field and handling questions; listening to other students' presentations and responding with questions; listening to and taking notes from lectures and responding critically to their content in discussion; reading academic texts and responding critically to their contents in discussion; and preparing and presenting a Research Poster, responding to questions, and asking questions about other posters.All PUGS 1 students undertake formative assessments during the course: University Writing, in the form of a 1500 word source-based written assignment; Speaking, in the form of a ten-minute individual oral presentation to the class followed by Q&A; and hosting their research poster.2) Outline ContentThe University Writing component includes work on selecting, evaluating, and integrating sources into writing, organising an essay (introduction, body, and conclusion), academic writing style and the use of cautions language. This is complemented by sessions on reading skills to promote economical and effective reading. Input leads to researching, planning and drafting a 1,500 word specialist essay in groups.The Listening and Note-Taking component features video lectures and presentations. A variety of note-taking styles are used and evaluated to help students refine their existing note-taking skills. A guest lecture provides an opportunity for students to practice the skills covered in class. Tutors guide work on preparatory material suggested by the lecturer, the lectures, in which students take notes and are encouraged to ask questions, and follow-up tutor-led classes where students compare their notes, evaluate their performance in following the lecture and discuss issues relating to the content.Academic speaking skills are developed through the Poster Q&A, Short Talk, and Seminar and Workshop Skills components. For the Q&A, tutors guide students through the process of choosing an article, and designing and hosting the poster. Preparation for the short talks is supported by classwork on presentation skills and language. The Seminar and Workshop Skills strand encourages the development of skills necessary for collaborative and interactive study; explaining issues and ideas, dealing with questions, and negotiating in groups.3) Student Learning ExperienceThe course is delivered by course tutors, who work with classes of up to fourteen students. The course director, responsible for the operational management of the course, is based on-site.After an orientation morning, students spend the majority of mornings in the classroom with their tutor, practicing academic language and skills and receiving feedback. Most days include work on writing tasks in a computer lab, also monitored by tutors. Afternoon classes are delivered by tutors within CSE Schools.Students receive written formative feedback on their writing submissions, and both peer and tutor feedback on their performance in presentation tasks. Students have the opportunity to ask questions about writing feedback in post-writing classes after each submission. Students also attend group tutorials to discuss progress.",

We shall consider how 'confessional' texts such as Chopin's The Awakening and Kraus's I Love Dick were received by contemporary readers and reviewers, and how far they have expedited changes in social attitudes towards femininity and the place of women in society. Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale will expose questions of sex, morality, power and allow us to consider the science fiction genre in a feminist context. Students will read two post-colonial novels and be asked to consider the relationship between history and the development of feminist theories.Through mini-lectures and supportive seminars, this course will give students the opportunity to read and discuss a range of fiction and non-fiction texts, as well as introducing literary theory based on feminist thought. Attention will be given to political, historical, social and cultural contexts. Students will be given introductory lectures on each text/author and will be asked to participate in group discussion, and be given the opportunity to deliver a short presentation. With guidance, students will identify literary devices through the close reading of excerpts and be encouraged to use recognised literary critical methodologies in their analysis of texts.",

The course explores the varied landscape of contemporary American fiction, seeking to showcase representative works and achieve a balance across the diverse range of voices, ethnicities and cultural positions.

    "summary": "Detective fiction is a valuable barometer for the social and political climate of a country. This course explores the development of detective fiction in America from the Golden Age of Chandler and Hammett to its  engagement in recent issues and events such as Hurricane Katrina. We shall explore the ways in which detective fiction expresses and reflects the changing zeitgeist of America, and how American writers have made use of, and further developed, traditional forms of the genre.",
    "course_description": "We shall locate and explore the beginnings of American pulp detective fiction through Hammett's creation of the iconic private eye, the Continental Op, and identify some key characteristics of detective fiction when examining Raymond Chandler's outwardly tough detective Philip Marlowe. We shall further consider Chandler's assertion in his essay 'The Simple Art of Murder', that detective fiction should be realistic, and that the detective hero must be able to operate in realistic conditions.The fiction of Thomas Harris will invite us to explore the development of serial killer fiction, notably the creation of Hannibal Lecter, himself both a killer and consultant.Throughout the course, we shall consider the interaction between the detective and other characters, paying particular attention to language. Students will look closely at excerpts of both dialogue and descriptive passages, and will be encouraged to use recognised literary critical terminology during in-class discussion and in written work.The work of Paul Auster will allow us to examine the postmodern detective novel and discuss how far critics' new terms such as 'soft-boiled detective fiction', 'meta-detective fiction' or 'anti-detective fiction' are representative. We shall consider how American detective fiction engages with catastrophic national events, such as Hurricane Katrina, exploring  a well-established detective series by James Lee Burke in relation to the 'real world' aftermath of Katrina and its crimes.Classes will consist of lectures, providing a contextual overview of each novel, followed by a guided discussion on themes, characterisation, language, plot, and narrative style. We shall analyse contemporary responses and reactions to the novels by evaluating and assessing ideas from non-literary texts such as criticism or journalism.The course will be taught in a small seminar setting, where participation will be supported and encouraged.",

Course participants read legal texts in order to exchange information and compare aspects of their own legal systems. Other language practice activities include courtroom role-plays; problem solving discussions; listening to talks; formal letter writing practice. There are opportunities for more individual work, for example in presenting a summary of a legal case or preparing and giving a presentation on a legal topic.",
    "course_description": "The course aims to improve oral fluency and confidence in speaking English through a variety of activities including participating in mock trial roleplays; preparing and giving short talks; exchanging information about law cases; negotiating and participating in a simulated job interview. Writing activities focus on legal correspondence and writing case briefs and summaries. There is an emphasis on the development of vocabulary and reading skills. A range of materials from legal textbooks, case reports and newspaper articles will be used to present aspects of the legal system in the UK.Throughout the course students will be encouraged to talk about their own legal systems. The tasks are predominantly based on authentic legal texts. Most tasks involve an integration of two or more language skills and are presented within a legal topic-based syllabus framework. UK legal topics, including Tort/Delict; Civil and Criminal law; Constitutional law; Company law; Contract law and International law, mirroring the syllabus for a typical UK undergraduate law programme, are focussed on in order to introduce vocabulary and conceptual knowledge so that students can talk meaningfully in English about aspects of their own legal systems. Students will visit the Scottish Courts and the Scottish Parliament and carry out a Law Library based research task resulting in giving an oral summary of a UK legal case to their colleagues. The course culminates in a law conference at which each participant gives a presentation in English on a legal topic.",

We will study a number of examples of the unreliable narrator from a number of different genres including the Gothic short story, a ghost novella, a dystopian novel and a realist novel set at the time of the Glasgow International Exhibition of 1888. Our discussions will turn on how the reader builds a relationship with an unreliable narrator and whether or not our bond of trust with our touchstone in a novel is finally compromised by their unreliability.",

Language and identity will be key themes for exploration throughout the course as we examine writersÂ¿ use of Scots and consider the influence and importance of linguistic devices. Throughout the course, both in formative and summative assessment and also in group discussion, students will be encouraged to identify literary devices and refer to them using recognised literary terminology, so as to develop an academic vocabulary.Student Learning ExperienceThe course will be taught in a small seminar setting, where participation will be supported and encouraged. The course will explore these writers' presence in the city through manuscript collections. We will also follow their footsteps through the city and see how their presence has been marked with monuments, plaques and other forms of cultural heritage.",

    "course_description": "Choosing a Topic:Following an initial discussion with the Course Organiser, students will be assigned a tutor who will provide supervision and guidance throughout the course. In the first instance, students will be encouraged to choose a topic that excites them, and to consider the scope, scale and limitations of a 6000 word essay.One-to-One Support:Students will meet with their tutor on a one-to-one basis no fewer than three times throughout the course, to discuss essay title, bibliography and secondary materials , essay structure, and general progress. It is expected that during the first of these meetings, students will establish with their tutor an essay title, and discuss a 500 word outline of the project,  which will have been prepared in advance by the student.Prior to the second meeting, students should prepare a draft introduction, essay plan, and/or bibliography on which the tutor will provide feedback during the meeting.The third meeting should provide opportunity to discuss general progress and to identify any particular challenges or areas of uncertainty.Workshops and Peer Support:Although this course focuses on independent study, students will be part of a cohort and, as such, enjoy the benefits of  group and peer support. Students will be encouraged to attend at least two tutor-led workshops designed especially for students taking this course, during which topics and skills  such as 'research methods' and 'academic voice' will be explored. During these workshops, students will be encouraged to verbally present an overview of their chosen topic, and discuss with peers, their progress.",

    "course_description": "Content of course1.\tOverview. An introduction to the main themes and developments in twentieth century British philosophy.2.\tR G Collingwood (1889-1943). Collingwood emerged from the tradition of British Idealism to produce important work in both the philosophy of history and aesthetics. This session examines his work in relation to that Idealist tradition and in relation to the empiricist tradition which dominated academic philosophy for much of his career.3.\tG. E. Moore (1873-1958). Moore was an important figure in both the break from Idealism and in the development of philosophical ethics in the twentieth century, and his ideas influenced the Bloomsbury Group.4.\tA. J. Ayer (1910-1989). Ayer popularized the work of logical positivism in Britain, which rejected large parts of philosophical writing as meaningless. We look at his views on such areas (including ethics and theology) and the effect on later philosophers.5.\tLudwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951). Wittgenstein bridges the gap between logical positivism and later developments in ordinary language philosophy. We look at the radical changes in his views over his career.6.\tR. M. Hare (1919-2002). Although little known outside academic philosophy, HareÂ¿s work typifies the close analysis of language that was characteristic of much philosophical ethics in the twentieth century.7.\tMary Midgley (1919-). Midgley has become famous as a major critic of Richard Dawkins. In this session, we examine her work as part of a movement to move philosophy away from linguistic analysis to substantive ethical questions.8.\tGillian Rose (1947-95). Rose provides a contrast to most of the other philosophers on this course in her engagement with continental philosophy. This session examines her approach as an alternative to the mainstream analytic tradition.9.\tBernard Williams (1929-2003) WilliamsÂ¿ work in ethics can be seen as focusing on authenticity and self-expression. This session examines the adequacy of such an approach to ethical questions.10.\tFinal discussion. An opportunity to consider the course as a whole and to return to specific issues in the light of that overview.",

Introduction to the course and a brief introduction to linguistics. This week will introduce the main topics and objectives of the course, and the main areas of study linguistics: phonology; morphology; syntax; semantics.2. Language change. This class will analyze how and why languages change. We will discuss language-internal change, as well as the effect of external factors like historical events, culture, and geopolitics.3. Doing historical and variationist linguistics. This class will introduce students to the main principles and methodologies for the study of historical linguistics and synchronic variation.Block 2.  The story of English.4. The prehistory of English. This week will introduce students to the Indo-European language family, and in particular to the Germanic branch, to which English belongs.5. Old English. This class will survey the main linguistic features of Old English, its writing system, and some of its key texts.6. Middle English. This class will survey the main linguistic features of Middle English, with a particular focus on the effects of language contact on its development. This week will also discuss some key texts in relation to issues of spelling and pronunciation.7. Modern English. This class will survey the main linguistic features of Early Modern and Modern English, with a particular focus on the standardization process and the rise of a prestige pronunciation.8. Scots and Scottish English. This class will discuss the main history and linguistic features of Scots and Scottish English, and attitudes towards them.Block 3. New Englishes.9. English around the world.  This week will outline the historical spread of English around the world, and describe the linguistic features of some key varieties, and the factors that led to geographical variation in New Englishes.10. Creole Englishes. English as a lingua franca. The first part of the class will focus on the development of English-based pidgins and creoles. Students will be introduced to the characteristics and principles of extreme language contact, with particular attention given to the linguistic consequences of the slave trade. In the second part of the class we will discuss the role of English as a lingua franca, and the effects that second language learners are having on the language.This course will begin with an introduction to some of the main areas of the study of language, followed by the principles of language change and the methodology used to study it. This section will cover both language-internal systemic processes (e.g. phonological chain shifts, semantic change, grammaticalization), and the external historical, cultural and sociological factors that can produce and shape language change. With these theoretical and methodological bases in place, the course will then survey the various historical stages in the evolution of English in chronological order: its pre-historical origins, Old English, Middle English, Modern English and new Englishes (American English, and English in Africa and Asia).  This survey will also include a section on the development of English and Scots in Scotland.",

This overview will form the foundation for the second part of the course, when students will explore how language has evolved, how language is acquired by children, and how language varies across space, social groups and time.The course is organised in six blocks, three per semester. The three blocks in the first semester will be:1) Phonetics and phonology (sounds and sound systems)2) Morphology and syntax (word and sentence structure)3) Semantics (meaning at the level of the word and sentence)The three blocks in the second semester will be:1) Pragmatics (meaning in discourse and conversation)2) Language evolution and acquisition3) Language variation and changeEach week will combine lecture and tutorial discussion. The first semester, which is more content heavy, will include weekly exercises and questionnaires aimed at allowing students to put their knowledge into practice and also to continuously assess their understanding of the topics. Exercises will be set as homework and will be corrected and discussed in class. The second semester will have stronger methodological and discussion components. Students will be introduced to seminal papers and experiments in each subfield and will be asked to discuss and compare them.",

Beginning with some of the answers offered by thinkers in the ancient world, the block will move forwards to our own day, exploring the substance of a variety of religious and non-religious answers, as well as the appropriateness of the question itself.2. Knowledge and certainty: In the second half of the first semester, basic issues in epistemology will be examined through classic readings in idealism, empiricism and common-sense realism.3. Political philosophy: In the third teaching block, central topics in political philosophy will be considered, with a particular emphasis on political authority and the state. The topics discussed will include contractarianism, freedom and equality.4. Mind and body: In the final semester, the course will introduce classic topics in philosophy of mind such as dualism, the problem of other minds, functionalism and the problem of consciousness.The course will be taught by a mixture of lectures, tutor-led discussions and group work. Students will be encouraged to read relevant material before each class, including extracts from the works of key philosophers. The tutor will then develop discussion based on the reading and encourage the students to develop both their understanding of the basic issues, the particular approach of the reading to that topic, and to engage critically with that approach. Emphasis will be placed on developing both an understanding of key philosophical positions and a willingness and ability to assess critically those positions.",

It will provide an overview of core philosophical ideas and concepts from the perspective of classical and contemporary work in philosophy and scholarship in philosophy and film. Throughout the course, the question of how films can illustrate and advance philosophical ideas, as well as their potential limitations, will be key.The course will examine the intersection between philosophy and film and will consider three distinct yet interrelated approaches.1. Philosophy of Film addresses classical issues on the nature of film, such as: film as art, the ontology of film, and film and emotion.2. Philosophy through Film considers philosophical arguments and ideas through their treatment in film.3. Film as Philosophy claims that films, rather than being mere vehicles for philosophical ideas, may themselves be considered works of philosophy.Topics covered will range from Plato's Cave to the Paradox of Horror and will feature films by Woody Allen, Michael Haneke, and many more.Each of the topics covered will include a screening and lecture/ seminar. The screenings will introduce students to a range of classic and contemporary films, each providing a filmic insight into the topic. Lectures/ seminars will introduce the philosophical area in question and combine discussion of the film with critical engagement with relevant texts. In the final week, the lecture/ seminars will be replaced by open discussions of screened films. Students will be provided with all essential reading/ viewing and recommendations for further study.During the course, students will contribute to a collaborative blog on film and philosophy, which will make up 25% of the overall course mark. The remaining 75% of the overall course mark will be by way of 2000 word essay, submitted electronically after the end of the course. There will be workshops on both assessments during the course.",

It also considers the influence of Scottish thinking on America, and the circumstances which led to the eclipse of Enlightenment thinking.",
    "course_description": "1. Philosophy - the 'science of man' and its centrality in Scottish Enlightenment thought.2. Ethics - moral sense theory, sympathy, and the roles of self-interest and benevolence.3. Social Theory - man as a social being, and the development over time of social institutions.4. Historiography - the Enlightenment notion of progress, and the Whig conception of history. Conjectural history; stadial theory; and comparative history.5. Medicine - the significance of the nervous system in eighteenth century medical thinking, and its association with philosophical notions of sensibility and sympathy.6. Aesthetics - theories of art and beauty, and the roles of sensibility and sympathy.7. Literature - the novel as an Enlightenment text: Tobias SmollettÂ¿s The Expedition of Humphry Clinker, and Henry MacKenzieÂ¿s The Man of Feeling.  Robert BurnsÂ¿ enlightened poetry.8. Religion - the religious controversies of the period: HumeÂ¿s scepticism, and the role of Moderates within the Kirk.9. The Scottish Enlightenment and America - the influence of the Scottish literati on American education and American politics.10. The End of the Scottish Enlightenment - critics of Enlightenment within Scotland, and the eclipse of the Enlightenment in ScotlandÂ¿s universities.The course aims to introduce students to the central themes, issues and theories of the Scottish Enlightenment. There will be a particular emphasis on the enduring relevance of the Enlightenment. Students will examine current approaches to the Scottish Enlightenment, and areas of contemporary debate among scholars. The course also aims to enhance studentsÂ¿ critical, discursive and analytical skills.The course is interdisciplinary: thinkers such as David Hume and Adam Smith studied and wrote on a wide range of academic disciplines, on the basis that each discipline is apt to shed explanatory light on the others. This is a traditional Scottish approach to study, which predates the Scottish Enlightenment - and it is the approach which this course will adopt. Philosophy was the central discipline of the Scottish Enlightenment - and it will similarly be central to our studies.There will be the opportunity for guided tours of museums and galleries, as well as locations in Edinburgh which relate to the period of the Scottish Enlightenment. A philosophical walking tour of Edinburgh will be arranged.Students will complete a 1500-word source analysis, and a 2500-word essay. There will be a choice of disciplines for each assessment component.",

Is the absence of external coercion sufficient for considering an individual free? This class will examine the idea of liberty looking at both classical and contemporary texts.3.\tDemocracy - Democracy means 'rule of the people' but who are the 'people' and what does 'rule' mean? This class will explore these fascinating issues by looking at the main theories of democracy and their relevance for the contemporary world.4.\tDistributive Justice This class will analyse the normative principles guiding the distribution of economic resources across societies. We will especially focus on the theories developed by John Rawls (1971) and Robert Nozick (1974) and on the critiques raised against them by other thinkers.5.\tEquality In this class we will examine the concept of social and political equality and look at the distinction between formal equality, equality of opportunity and equality of outcome.6.\tPolitical Obligation Why should people obey the laws of their political community? This class will explore the problem of political obligation by looking at the main answers given to this question by modern and contemporary political thinkers.7.\tCommunity - Communitarians argue that individuals are deeply rooted in their communities (e.g. national, religious, linguistic etc.) and shaped by their values. This class will explore these issues and analyse the main arguments raised by communitarian thinkers against liberalism.8.\tDifference. In this class we will assess whether equality requires that the state should provide identical treatment for all individuals and groups or whether it should treat each of them differently. We will especially focus on issues concerning women and minority cultures.9.\tEnvironmental Ethics and Political Theory Environmental ethics is concerned with the study of the relationship between human beings and the environment. This class will examine how environmental ethics has affected contemporary debates in political theory.10.\tInternational Justice and Global Politics Political theorists are becoming increasingly concerned with global issues. In this class we will especially focus on the tension between nationalism and cosmopolitanism and on the issue of global distributive justice.",

In this class we will explore some of the main arguments in defence of free speech as well as justifications for imposing limits upon it. We will especially focus on the works of John Stuart Mill and Joel Feinberg.3.\tFree speech and blasphemy. This class will explore the tension between free speech and offence against religious faiths. We will especially focus on the Satanic Verses controversy and the Jyllands-Posten cartoons controversy.4.\tFree speech and hate speech. In this class we will examine the issues raised by hate speech, including incitement to religious hatred and political hate speech.5.\tFree speech and pornography. This class will focus on the arguments raised especially (but not only) by feminist thinkers against pornography. We will also discuss whether pornography can be considered a form of speech or not.6.\tFree speech, art and censorship. Artistic expression (e.g. literature, theatre, painting etc.) has often been object of state censorship. In this class we will examine whether the peculiar nature of artistic expression warrants fewer restrictions to free speech than other forms of expression.7.\tFree speech and copyright. Copyright infringers are normally denied freedom of speech. In this class, we will assess whether there are sound arguments for this.8.\tFree speech and privacy. This class will explore the tension between free speech and individual privacy, focusing on issues such as defamation and the publication of confidential information.9.\tFree speech and the media. In this class we will examine the relevance of free speech in relation to press, broadcasting and commercial advertising.10.\tFree speech and the Internet. The advent of the Internet has introduced novel themes in discussions about free speech, such as anonymity, lack of quality control and the presence of potentially very large audiences. This class will examine these and other related issues.",

    "summary": "This course is for students on the CAHSS International Foundation Programme.This foundation course acts as a gateway to studying social science subjects taught at undergraduate level, including sociology, anthropology, economics, and politics.  The course also teaches skills required in fields such as law and business studies. It provides an overview of social sciences techniques, with an emphasis on developing academic skills, like interpreting social science questions, reading academic texts, using scientific data, and composing essays.  Students will develop a strong skills-base from which to explore social sciences further.",
    "course_description": "This is a foundational course at Level 7 (SQF) which introduces students to elementary aspects of social science.  Offered at the start of the International Foundation Programme, it aims to provide both knowledge of the subject area (covering a canon of fundamental theories and topics within the history of social science, as well as raising contemporary questions) and develop essential academic skills, required for effective independent learning.  Additionally, the course presents simple questions around scientific methodology.  Basic skills in numeracy, writing, referencing, and critical thinking are developed through in-class exercises and via formative and summative assessment preparation.  Focus will be placed on good communication across all mediums (written, oral, and use of ICTs).The course is divided into 3 key 'knowledge' sections, with a shorter introductory section.  The introductory section examines the history, development, methods and approaches of social sciences in general, developing students' awareness of a 'social perspective' on the world around them.  Each subsequent 'main' section focuses on two or three different social science disciplines.  The first section is entitled 'Social difference' (on sociology and anthropology), the second 'Social inequality' (on economics and social policy), and the third 'Social security' (on politics, law and sociology).  In between tutor-led 'knowledge' based classes there are 'skills' sessions, where the focus is on student participation with exercises involving collaborative working, technical skills (referencing, writing), using ICT systems, or developing essay planning.",

In each of these areas, students will examine key social influences on human behaviour. Additionally, the course will present simple questions around methodology, encouraging students to develop their own sociological questions by the end of the term.The following topics will be discussed:The Sociological PerspectiveIs human behaviour natural or cultural? The influence of society and culture in shaping human behaviour and what is 'natural'.Sociological TheoryAre humans created or creators? How free are we? Contrasting theories; how society works; the relation between the individual and society; are we puppets or free agents?Culture and IdentityThe impact of culture (and subcultures) on social and personal identity: social class; power; gender/sexuality; ethnicity; nationality and globalisation; disability; age; leisure; consumerism.The FamilyWhat is the 'family'? What is its 'core'? Who belongs to it? What does it do? How has it changed? The diversity of family types and roles.InequalityDifferent forms of inequality, different explanations of why inequality exists, the concept of 'meritocracy'.EducationThe focus here is on differences in 'educational achievement': who achieves what at school, and why?CrimeIssues in identifying the extent of crime, types of crime, and who are the criminals. The causes of crime and deviance.Sociological ExplanationStudents will choose topics to reflect their own interests/current events and develop and apply sociological explanations.Classes will involve a mixture of lecture-based teaching and tutorial discussion.",

    "course_description": "This course is intended to provide an entry point to the credit study of social sciences at COL. The 20 credit model will allow proper time for students to develop understanding and key academic skills and to benefit from formative assessment and feedback.The course will provide an introduction to anthropology by examining cultural practices and ideas and by exploring some of the discipline's core debates. Engaging with anthropological classics and contemporary works, students will learn how to think anthropologically and to look at the world that surrounds them from a different perspective. The broad scope of the themes discussed will enable students to appreciate the cross-cultural diversity of human beliefs and practices. The course endeavours to place anthropological debates and concepts in historical perspective, scrutinizing the specific political and cultural milieus from which they emerged and the biases implicit in work from different eras. A key aim of the course is to reflect on the relevance of anthropology for understanding the complex dynamics of the contemporary world.The course begins with a brief consideration of what anthropologists do, exploring the central concerns of the discipline and its distinctive ethnographic methodology (including fieldwork and participant observation). The remainder of the course is organised in two parts. The first part focuses on the life course. Students will explore the cross-cultural significance of key events and phases of human life, including birth, childhood, initiation, aging and death. The second part of the course examines key concerns in anthropology, such as personhood, ritual, gender, kinship, food, ethnicity, healing, the body, and witchcraft. Throughout the course, students will explore what it means to be human though the comparative study of cultures and societies. The wide range of topics discussed will allow students to reflect on the ways in which different domains of social life are deeply interconnected and mutually formative, thereby encouraging a holistic view of society and culture.Each session will combine lecture and tutorial discussion.

However, perspectives from social science show that bodies may be better understood as being shaped by a range of social and cultural factors, including gender, age and beliefs. This course draws primarily on sociological perspectives - and others including anthropology, philosophy, medicine and holistic healthcare - to provide a critical overview of these different ways of understanding bodies.",
    "course_description": "Content of course1.\tWhich bodies? Nature and societyIn the first week we will cover the basis of the debate underpinning the course. Bodies are undeniably biological Â¿thingsÂ¿, but they are also social. We will look at explanations of the social Â¿constructionÂ¿ of the body and the interaction between biology and society.2.\tChanging ideas about the body: historical and philosophical perspectivesThis class covers a range of thinkers on the body, from Aristotle to Norbert Elias. We will look at their perspectives on the development of western ideas about the body.3.\tDisciplining the bodyIn this class, we will explore the way in which society shapes and attempts to control the body. As well as considering the views of thinkers such as Michel Foucault and Bryan Turner, we will also consider the impact of a range of institutions (e.g. prisons, schools, governments, etc.).4.\tDifferently known bodiesThis week covers feminist perspectives on bodies, which have highlighted fundamental differences in how we experience them. Hence, we will explore differences in embodied experience, for example in relation to gender, (dis)ability and age.5.\tMedical bodiesThe institution of medicine and the dominance of rational science and medical ways of knowing are examined in this class. We will also look at the impact of advances in technology on understandings of bodies. Critiques of mainstream medicine lead into the next class.6.\tHolistic bodiesThis week offers an overview of different ways of knowing about bodies found in Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurveda, Homeopathy and Â¿mind-bodyÂ¿ therapies. Why are they popular? Why are they still marginal?7.\tConsuming bodies and the Â¿body projectÂ¿Bodies in consumer culture and the body as a never-ending Â¿projectÂ¿ are the focus of this week. Areas of focus will include cosmetic surgery and eating disorders.8.\tWorking bodies and work on bodiesWhether paid or unpaid, work is often central to our embodied experience, not least because we spend so much time doing it. In this class we will look in particular at work which focuses on bodies (e.g. home care workers, beauticians, boxers, bouncers).9.\tBodies in popular cultureIn the penultimate class we will look at the flood of TV shows which tell us how to eat, dress, lose weight and deal with Â¿embarrassing illnessesÂ¿. How Â¿helpfulÂ¿ can we understand these to be, and might they fulfil a particular social function?10.\tCourse review and summary",

It will look at a range of theories, considering how each makes distinctive use of key concepts, including those also employed by other theories, to offer unique understandings of the processes of world affairs. Theories and concepts will be explored and tested through engagement with historical and contemporary case studies, capturing examples of warfare, economic and social crises, international trade, and the failures and successes of diplomacy. These case studies will thus be considered not only as isolated series of events but as examples of important and recurring phenomena in world affairs.Theories:The course will consider different variants of the Â¿mainstreamÂ¿ International Relations approaches of realism and liberalism as well as 'critical' alternatives such as constructivism, feminism, post-colonialism, and Marxism.Case studies:Possible case studies to be discussed include, the Cold War, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, recurring economic crises, the COVID-19 pandemic, and Russia's on-going invasion of Ukraine.Issues:Case studies and theories will allow exploration of broader issues such as security and insecurity, economic interdependence, the role of global institutions and international law, human rights and humanitarian intervention.Each session will intersperse lectures with tutorial activities and discussions. These will develop knowledge and understanding of International Relations as well as general academic skills and principles of good scholarship.

    "course_description": "Academic DescriptionThis course provides students with an overview of Global Health Policy as an academic discipline. It will focus on the policies and practice of global health, and the interconnectedness of health and its wider determinants within states and internationally. Students will learn about key theories and concepts underpinning global health, including measures of health (morbidity, mortality, DALY), the main burden of disease in low- and high-income countries, and the concept of (non-)communicable diseases. In addition, students will learn to critically assess the role of international organisations, governments, and the private sector in shaping global health policies. By the end of the course, students will have developed a good understanding of the fundamentals of global health and its policies.Outline ContentThe course will cover the four main building blocks of Global Health Policy:The first block will provide students with foundational knowledge of the main concepts and theories of global health, drawing from economics and political science. It will also equip students with key epidemiological concepts, such as morbidity, mortality and DALY.The second block will focus on exploring the governance mechanisms of global health. We will examine the role of governments, international institutions such as the UN, foundations, and the private sector. We will look at partnerships and funding mechanisms and discuss current issues related to this block.In the third block, students will explore the main issues which have emerged or are emerging in Global Health Policy, and which have shaped policies and practice. Students will analyse past and present pandemics and country preparedness, and the issues of humanitarian health and climate change.In the fourth block, students will learn about wider determinants of health and the impacts of issues such as poverty and ethnicity on health.Student Learning ExperienceThe course will be taught through a combination of lectures, class discussions, group work and practical case studies. Lectures will introduce key concepts and theories, and case studies will allow students to deepen their understanding through practical application and exploration of contemporary issues. In addition, the group activities will provide an opportunity for students to strengthen their academic skills.",

    "summary": "How do we relate to society? How are differences between people in society produced, and in what ways do these lead to hierarchies of (self-)worth? To answer these questions, this course will discuss sociological perspectives on key contemporary issues such as systemic racism, sexuality, populism, and climate change. You will also gain familiarity with key research methods that sociologists use to explore these issues.",
    "course_description": "Academic description: The course explores sociological perspectives on the interrelation of social selves and social worlds, and on identities and social difference. It introduces you to key sociological theories and research and uses these insights to a) discuss sociological concepts such as gender, class, racialisation, and nationalism, and to b) familiarise yourself with core research methods, such as discourse analysis and ethnography, and the principles of research design in the social sciences. Throughout, you will have the opportunity to engage with a range of sociological research in and from differentparts of the world.Outline content: The course is divided into two parts. The first part addresses different dimensions of the social self and the embeddedness of the self in social worlds. We will look at how people shape and are shaped by class, social institutions such as marriage and the family, and how even nature is shaped by the interrelationship between the self and social worlds. The second part focuses more closely at the processes involved in the production of identities and difference. We will look at racialisation, patriarchy, and populism, but also at the processes through which minorities have contested hierarchies based on identity and difference. At different intervals, the course introduces core social research methods, e.g. ethnography, and you will have the opportunity to practice research techniques in groups.Student learning experience: The course is intended to gradually build up a richer understanding of the different dimensions to, and the relationship between, key social processes and concepts, such as racialisation and nationalism, class and gender. Sessions will combine elements of lectures with tutorial-style discussion and group work. Activities, such as analysis exercises and essay writing, will help develop your abilities in critical reflection and argumentation, while discussion will develop skills in working constructively with others and oral presenting of ideas. In addition, there is a formative assessment to write an essay plan, which is designed to prepare and support you in meeting the requirements of the summative assessment, a 2,500-word essay.",

The introduction will look at historical and contemporary environmental pollutants and the associated range of impacts these can have upon human health. It will link the current decarbonisation strategy to increased pressures to develop technology-critical new materials and the consequences this may have for environmental pollution and health. Having set the context, the course delves deeper into use of physical, chemical and biological methods to remediate contaminated sites. It will introduce biosynthetic methods and how these can be used for recovery and recycling of technology-critical elements. The final phase of the course will be devoted to a group mini-project giving a taster of research in these areas (using remediation, recovery and recycling for a sustainable future). Students interested in this course may also be interested in Sustainable Futures in Energy which can be taken in following years.The course will consist of a lecture session on environmental pollution with integrated, interactive case studies about historical pollution and health impacts. This will be linked to two visits: (i) historical chromium pollution in Glasgow and the new recreational and geoenergy spaces that have been built on remediated land; (ii) legacy mining contamination (metals) that is currently impacting a local river in Edinburgh. Samples collected at the latter will then be analysed during a laboratory session. A second lecture session will focus on contemporary pollution arising from current decarbonisation of our society and will link to the project work on lithium ion batteries (metals and plastics wastes). Laboratory sessions will give a hands-on introduction to biological methods (micro-pipettes, microscopes, and UV plate readers) that are used by researchers. Students will learn about how these methods are used in a number of different applications. Students will also have one session to bring together what they have learned into their mini-project which they will then present in poster format in the final session. One session will be devoted to introducing you to concepts in Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI). RRI explores the ways in which a piece of research can contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while also surfacing other important issues in areas such as diversity and inclusion. You will be asked to reflect upon how your mini-project work aligns with RRI.The course has been designed to offer you a variety of different styles of learning which reflect the fact that the desired Learning Outcomes are not simply focused on the detailed technical information content, but rather, should develop your academic and communication skills more widely. You will engage in lectures, which will be followed up by group explorations of extension topics, with group findings shared with your peers via (electronic) poster sessions and discussion. The group mini-project will offer you the opportunity to work with active scientists for a taster of research in these areas, including planning and communication. The course includes short field trips which will allow you to see some real examples of some of the topics explored in the classroom (as well as offering a break from the classroom setting!).
