    "summary": "Volcanoes, earthquakes, mountain chains and the diversity of the Earth's rocks tell us that the Earth has been a dynamic planet since its formation 4.6 billion years ago.  This course has two main aims: to impart an understanding of the processes which shape the Earth, and to develop practical skills in recognising the evidence of these processes in rocks, both in the field and in the laboratory.  The course will have a primary focus on the materials of which the Earth is made, how the major constituents are distributed between core, mantle and crust and how this changes with time through the agencies of plate tectonics and volcanism. Geological resources, from energy, to minerals, and water, are essential for all aspects of society. How these resources are categorised, and where they are they formed is part of our fundamental understanding of the Earth as an integrated system.",

    "course_description": "Please note this course is not available for Visiting students.Environmental geochemistry is about the sources, distribution and interactions of chemical species in the earth system, covering rocks, minerals, soil, water and biology. The surface environment has dominant controls on these interactions because the exposure of minerals to water and biology has the effect speeding up many geological reactions. In this course, we focus on natural waters because the mobility and speciation of chemical elements in natural wasters is central to many of the feedbacks that connect geochemical, biological, and geological processes at Earth's surface.The course is delivered in the form of lectures, geochemical laboratory practical  and field trips, the latter designed to showcase the practical applications of your theoretical understanding. Topics/lectures include (1) Controls on the composition of natural waters and classification, role of colloids and their surface chemistry in contolling water composition, energy demand for geochemical reactions and reaction pathways, metabolic pathways exploited by micro-organisms and higher organisms and their impact on nutrient and organic matter (carbon cycling) in the environment, and material cycling in estuarine environments. One weekend field trip to Keswick (lake district) and a day trip to Seafield Pond (near Dunbar). Taken together, these approaches will equip you with vital skills in (i) field observations, (ii) geochemical analysis coupled with data analysis and modelling, leading to (iii) robust scientific interpretation and professional/scientific reporting.Course content(1) Controls on the composition of natural waters and classification(2) Forms of natural dissolved substances in natural waters(3) Colloids/ mineral surface chemistry surface adsorption reactions(4) Geochemical reactions, reaction pathways and rate determining reactions(5) Sources of energy for natural reactions in the natural environments(6) Autotrophic Metabolism: Living off sunlight and inorganic substances(7) Heterotrophic metabolism: Living off organic compounds(8) Organic matter cycling in natural environments(9) Estuarine Environments10) Estuarine Circulation(11) Estuarine Sedimentation(12) Estuarine Chemistry: Basics(13) Estuarine Chemistry: Metals(14) Estuarine Chemistry: Carbon(15) Estuarine Chemistry: Nitrogen(16) Human Impacts on Estuaries /revisionhttps://path.is.ed.ac.uk/courses/EASC08024_SS1_SEM1http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/current/dpt/cxeasc08024.htm***** Fieldwork *****There will be two compulsory field trips for this course1.\tAfternoon trip to (Seafield Pond) Dunbar date to be confirmed2.\tWeekend field trip to Lake District (Keswick)  18 October - 20 October 2024",

    "summary": "This course is intended as a foundation course for all Earth Science students with emphasis on processes that operate at the global scale. The interactions between geology, chemistry, physics and biology affecting the origin and evolution of life, Earth surface processes, and the climate history of the planet are studied. These together form the characteristics of the environment in which we live.This course should also be of general interest to Biology students by providing a thorough basis for understanding the geological aspects of global environmental change, and in particular, the evolution of life in this context. Chemists will benefit from an application of basic chemical principles to complex natural systems, while the course also provides an important background for those interested in temporal phenomena e.g. archaeologists.The course will consist of four main components:The first part (4 weeks by Dr Stephen Brusatte) will present the evolution of the Earth in general and of life in particular. The roles of the atmosphere and geosphere on changes in the biosphere are discussed, emphasising the driving mechanisms (internal and external forcing) for change. Significant events in earth history are considered, including the origin of life, geochemical evolution of the atmosphere, and mass extinctions. After covering this module, students will be able to recall the main features of the evolution of the planet and life on earth.The second section (2 weeks by Dr. Alex Thomas) introduces the concept of global climate change across a spectrum of time-scales from many millions of years to inter-annual variations. The emphasis is on identifying the main processes that control climate variability and change on these different time-scales, and on using examples from Earth history to illustrate how these processes may interact. This leads to the concept of the climate system; a complex coupled system where components may interact to either enhance or reduce any initial change in climate. Natural processes including those related to tectonic activity, weathering of rocks, changes in solar output, changes in the EarthÂ¿s orbit around the sun, and natural auto-oscillations, in the climate system (such as El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation) are considered, as well as Anthropogenic processes of climate change related to changing greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations in the atmosphere. From this module students will be able to recall the main timescales on which climate change occurs, and will be able to account for these scales of change with reference to current understanding on the topic. They will be able to assess the degree to which recent climate change is exceptional compared to previous times, and will understand the significance and reliability of future predictions based on climate model results.The third part (2 weeks by Dr. Geoff Bromiley) is a basic introduction to the foundations of chemistry that underpins our fundamental understanding of natural chemical reactions. The course assumes very little chemistry and starts from first principles (fundamental building blocks of matter) to chemical reactions and what drives them. The lectures will run in parallel with assessed laboratory practical sessions designed to consolidate the application of the chemical concepts to natural substances/processes. On completion of this module, students will acquire a solid grasp of chemical principles upon which to build their chemistry skills relevant to Earth Materials and Practical Geochemistry and Data Analysis in later years.The final part (2weeks by Dr. Alex Thomas) looks at earth processes from an integrated point of view through a systematic study of biogeochemical cycles. The major biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus are discussed and compared and detailed interactive practical sessions are used to illustrate measurement, analysis and synthesis of biogeochemical data. Links between the physical climate system and biogeochemical cycles are introduced to show how human activity is impacting on the environment. On completion of this module, students will be able to use the terminology and appreciate the merits of the cyclical approach to biogeochemistry. They will be able to recall the principal components of each biogeochemical element and the processes operating within each reservoir. They will appreciate the differences between the biogeochemical elements and also the human impact on each cycle.Appropriate clothing for practicalsSome of the practicals in weeks 6-11 involve working with chemicals. For your own safety, and that of others, you must wear suitable clothing. Footwear must be closed toe (no sandals or flipflops). Clothing should cover exposed skin: shorts, skirts and kilts are not suitable. Long hair should be tied back. Scarfs and long neck ties must not be worn in the laboratory. If you insist on dressing up for class then a bow tie is acceptable. You are also expected to bring a lab notebook to the environmental chemistry practicals.",
    "course_description": "Part I Origin and Evolution of Life (Dr Stephen Brusatte, SB)Week 1 Building a Habitable Earth, Origin of Life & its ComplexityThis week we will cover the basics of Earth formation and structure, the age of the Earth, the origin of liquid water and the atmosphere, why Earth is an ideal setting for the evolution of life. We will ask: What is life?, what materials are necessary for life?, how did life form?. Topics will include prokaryotic vs. eukaryotic cells, direct and indirect evidence for the earliest life, the oldest fossils. We will examine the Proterozoic world, cyanobacteria and the oxygen revolution in EarthÂ¿s atmosphere, origin of eukaryotes, the first multicellular life, Snowball Earth and its effects on evolution, the Ediacaran faunaWeek 2 The Cambrian Explosion, origin of body plans, and evolutionary innovationThis week we will look at life in the Phanerozoic, the origin of skeletons, the Cambrian Explosion: what it was and what caused it, the phylogeny of animals, the Burgess Shale, how Cambrian environments affected early animals. You will learn the origin of the major animal body plans, Darwin and the theory of evolution, and how to read a cladogram. The outcomes of the Cambrian explosion are explored: first large predators, modern food webs, substrate revolution, trilobites and other important Cambrian groups, SepkoskiÂ¿s diversity curve and evolutionary faunas, introduction to mass extinctions.Week 3 Palaeozoic Ocean Evolution, and the invasion of the landHere we will investigate the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event and the Palaeozoic fauna, the end-Ordovician mass extinction, amazing Silurian fossil sites in England and Scotland, conodonts and the origin of bony vertebrates, the origin of fishes and the evolution of jaws. Topics will include the earliest forays onto land and the Rhynie Chert of Scotland, the first terrestrial ecosystems, the origin of tetrapods and the rise of vertebrate faunas on land, exciting new tetrapod research in Scotland, the origin of reptiles and amphibians, synapsid-dominated faunas during the Permian, the formation of Pangea and its effects on terrestrial evolution, the end-Permian and Triassic mass extinctions, the Triassic recovery and rise of archosaurs, the earliest dinosaurs and their competitors.Week 4 Dinosaurs, mammals, and Oceanic faunaThe last week of the Origin and Evolution of Life part of the course we will study the evolution of dinosaurs across their ~160-million-year evolutionary history, the major groups of dinosaurs and their salient features and behaviours, dinosaur evolution and palaeogeography, the origin of birds and invasion of the sky. The end-Cretaceous extinction and the death of the dinosaurs, the earliest mammals and their explosive radiation after the end-Cretaceous extinction, archaic mammals of the early Paleogene, and the origins of the modern mammal groups, later Cenozoic cooling and the spread of grasslands, the origin of humans will aslos be studied. The end-Permian extinction and rise of the Modern fauna, the Mesozoic Marine Revolution, Mesozoic microfossils and their importance in biostratigraphy, Mesozoic marine reptiles, the diversification of sharks and teleost fishes, whales take to the water. The Gaia hypothesis, an overview of how life has impacted Earth over the course of the last few billion years will also be introduced.Part II Global Climatic and Environmental Change (Dr Alex Thomas, ALT)Week 5 Energy model of Planet Earth, Plate Tectonics, Weathering and ClimateWe will start by building a simple climate model to understand the controls on the EarthÂ¿s surface temperature. We will then introduce the climate System; structure, composition and circulation of the atmosphere and of the ocean. We will look at evidence for past climatic change and use these changes to investigate different controls on Climate change over geological time. The climate driving processes include weathering of rocks as a possible thermostat for Global climate; the role of tectonic processes in driving past greenhouse and icehouse times in Earth history.Week 6 Mechanisms of medium and short term climate change, past and futureCooling from the Cretaceous into the modern icehouse; glacial-interglacial cycles of the past 2 million years and the role of orbital forcing will be introduced. Looking at shorter more recent climate change we will look at natural short-term variations in climate due to stochastic processes, variations in solar irradiance, effects of volcanic eruptions, effects of large meteorite impacts and auto-oscillations such as the El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation. Anthropogenic climate change and the role of greenhouse gases and aerosols will then be covered Including how we can identify the causes of current changes in the climate and how our climate is and will change into the futurePart III Environmental Geochemistry (Dr Geoff Bromiley GDB)Week 7 Atoms, Electrons, and ReactionsThe first week of the chemistry part of the course will cover: The atom and its constituent parts; the nucleus, protons (p) and neutrons (n). Atomic number). Atomic weights expressed as atomic mass units. What is the mass of an atomic particle? Gram formula weight; AvogadroÂ¿s number. Definition of element (same p), and isotope (same p, various n). Summary of elements listed by numbers of protons. Representation of elements by their symbol, with their atomic number and mass number. Electrons: their relative mass, how far away from the nucleus they are. Electron orbitals: K, L, M shells, orbital pairs, electronic configurations. Elements listed by electronic configuration, which dictates the key chemical properties we are often interested in: bonding, volatility, metal vs non-metal. Define and explain the key parts of the periodic table, via groups, and via split into metal/amphoteric/non-metal. Bonding of atoms: ionic, covalent, metallic, Van der Waals. Ionic compounds and molecules. What is a chemical reaction? How do they occur.

The state-steady geochemical cycle.Part IV Global Biogeochemical Cycles (Dr Alex Thomas, ALT)Week 9 Introduction to Biogeochemistry, and the carbon cycleHere we will define what biogeochemical elements are and how we ca simplify their study into cycles. The terminology and simple box models will be introduced starting with the carbon cycle. Forms of carbon, thier major reservoirs, atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and lithosphere, including fossil carbon burning will be investigated including ow carbon moves between these stocks. We will use some simple chemistry to understand the behaviour of carbon in these reservoirs and how this affects climate.Week 10 Nutrient cycle: Nitrogen and PhosphorousWe will look at the two biogeochemical cycles of two elements essential for life: nitrogen and phosphorous. We will identify the main chemical forms of these elements in the environment, the stocks in different environmental reservoirs and how these elements are moved between these reservoirs and their chemical form altered to affect their availability to be used by organisms. Biological transformations of nitrogen compounds; nitrogen fixation, ammonia, assimilation, nitrification, assimilatory nitrate fixation, ammonification and denitrification will be studied. Weathering of phosphorus minerals and flux of phosphorus to the rivers and oceans and the pH dependence on P bioavailability will be looked at.https://path.is.ed.ac.uk/courses/EASC08023_SV1_SEM1http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/current/dpt/cxeasc08023.htm",

    "summary": "This two-week field course aims to develop an understanding of the relationship between surface and subsurface and increases the ability of students to gather pertinent data from rock outcrops and surface features. Mapping work is undertaken on two areas, one approximately 1.5 km2 in size, in week 1; and the other about 3 km2 in size, in week 2. Students spend 8 days on work directly related to these mapping exercises, complemented by 3 days of supporting field investigation. Two days are devoted to data analysis and report production. The course teaches and instils a wide range of field skills, including mapping, structural analysis and reconstruction, quantitative field techniques, and methods of data collection and integration. Students will learn how to exercise the autonomy and initiative required to conduct independent field work and will gain practise in drawing on a range of sources to assist with making informed judgements in the field. Students are trained in personal presentation skills of their field observations and interpretations, as well as group and team-working along with professional practice.",
    "course_description": "This course is entirely field trip-based. The 13 field and write-up days are devoted to the following exercises, centred on field localities in NW Scotland but applicable to the geological study of any region.1. Overview field excursion setting the scene and providing underpinning information on the geology.2. One day 'microcosm map' exercise on a small and easily-accessed area. This develops basic skills in map-making, field documentation and observation. Follow-up map inked-in in the evening is inspected and formative feedback provided.3. Three days mapping integrated with geometric analysis and prediction using stratum contours, utilising a 1-1.5 km2 field area with topography. Identification and mapping of units. Logging of representative sections of sedimentary units is integrated as a natural part of field documentation. This in total will enable the production of a completed map of the area, true-scale cross sections, and correct unit thicknesses. These are synthesised into a report and all (report, sections, logs, maps) handed in for initial assessment on day eight of the field trip. Formative feedback is provided along with an indicative grade (on the honours scale) on this suite of work during the second week of the field course.4. 2 days days of structural mapping and observation within more complex geology coupled with analysis of the observed structures. This may include structural mapping and analysis of thrusted units, documentation and analysis of fold geometries using field data and structural stereonets, and observation and documentation of the variety of structures developed in medium- to high-grade metamorphic rocks typified by shear structures.5. One day field trip to examine the geological record preserved in one of the major units or group of units exposed within the areas mapped in the course. This day trip may concentrate, for example, on the observation, documentation and interpretation of event sequences and cross-cutting relationships in deformed high-grade basement rocks. Alternatively, it may focus on critical intrusive igneous features and relationships or on the detailed characterisation of a diverse sedimentary sequence, depending on the field area location.6. Four days mapping in a second field area that bears some similarity with those already mapped in week 1 but which has additional complications and units, enabling the prior learning to be used and built upon. This work is written up on the final day and a report, cross-section(s) and map prepared for submission as part of the final assessment. The work previously submitted at the end of week one (item (3)) and returned to students during week 2 is submitted again along with material produced for (4) and (6) to track student development as part of the final assessment.Students on a focussed pathway (direct entry into year 2) will receive three afternoon tutorials in the week 11 of Sem 2 where they practice key techniques of geological map construction and interpretation.* This course is compulsory for 2nd year Earth Science, Earth Science programmes only.

    "summary": "This course runs as a field course based in the NW Highlands for two weeks. The aim of the course is to combine an understanding of the subsurface geology with the surface geomorphology. The first week will be based on identification and mapping of the geological succession of the Assynt region which is an area of classical geology and that records the building of the Caledonian mountain chain. The latter part of the first week will focus on learning how to build a geological map. The second week will then consider how, since approximately 2.7 Ma, the region has been impacted by the repeated growth of an ice sheet and the consequence this has had on the landscape. Having considered the longer term development of the region, we will then look at how the modern rivers and hillslopes are responding to both the bedrock geology and the remnant landforms from the last glaciation.",
    "course_description": "The trip comprises 12 field days with a rest-day in the middle where the teaching team swap between the geological and the geomorphological staff. In the first week, the days comprise:1. An overview of the geology of the Assynt area.2. A focus on the older rocks of the Lewisian and Torridonian successions and learning the basics of sedimentary logging required to build a record of changing processes and environments through geological time.3. An introduction to the basica of geological mapping in the field. This is done on section by the shores of Loch Assynt.4,5 and 6. These days are devoted to mapping the region around the Loch Glencoul for 2.5 days followed by a half day completing the map for submission.7. rest Day8. Introduction to evidence for glacial impacts on the landscape in terms of both erosional and depositional landforms.9. A consideration of the impacts of sea-level change and its record in the post-glacial terrace deposits near the coast at Ullapool.10. Glacio-lacustrine terraces at Achnasheen, and the analysis of stunning hummocky moraine deposits in Torridon.11. Training into measuring hydraulic geometry, discharge, sedimentology and geomorphic characteristics of river systems Follow-up from previous day. Analysing downstream fluvial responses to sea-level change.12. Carry on measuring river systems in groups and comparing the differences between different rivers and interpret the controls on their form.13. Study knickpoint development in a river in response to both berick hardness changes and sea-level change post-glacially.This course is compulsory for 2nd year Earth Science and Physical Geography Degree programme only.

Interaction of crystalline materials with light, X-rays and electrons are used to introduce the theoretical and practical basis behind the polarising microscope, X-ray diffraction and electron microscope/microprobe. In Composition of the Earth we review the main groups of Earth Materials, considering (1) how structure, chemistry, physical properties, and occurrence are interrelated, (2) how earth materials are used in modern research as information sources to reveal the nature of Earth processes, and (3) introduce theoretical aspects of modern Earth Materials research (e.g. phase stability and transitions). In the final section Chemical Equilibria we consider how the stability and occurrence of geomaterials can be predicted and determined numerically using thermodynamics, and consider factors governing the rates of Earth processes at variable depths.",

The course also considers the mechanisms by which sediment is generated as a result of the tectonic processes is analysed, as well as processes on in-situ sediment production. Sediment formation and transport processes are studied as well as the sediment and rock types that are generated. We then demonstrate how sedimentary rocks are used to reconstruct ancient tectonic and other environments.Practicals will develop concepts from the lectures.",

    "course_description": "The course will allow you to develop 3D visualisation skills and 4D-thinking abilities through interpretation and construction of geological maps and cross-sections. These skills will be integrated with hand specimen descriptions and compilation of geological histories of mapped areas. The course will also introduce the application of online digital databases (published geological maps; Digital Elevation Models; radar interferometry; remote sensing; satellite imagery) in solving global geological problems. A collective of graduate employers in a recent teaching review has highlighted these skills as vital for geoscientists. The 6-day course fieldtrip to the Lake District lays the foundations of field-skills required for the fieldwork aspects of your future degree.Note that although we will run the excursion to the Lake District provided that it is safe to do so, given the current situation with the Covid19 pandemic, there is the possibility that the excursion will be run online as a virtual exercise. If this happens then the dates will be the same, although the virtual exercise is only 5 days long as we donÂ¿t need to drive anywhere!)Trip 1: Saturday 15 - Friday 21 April 2023Trip 2: Saturday 27th May - Friday 2nd June 2023You will be allowed to choose which excursion you attend (subject to there being space).

    "summary": "The restlessness of our planet is a consequence of the dynamic processes that operate over time both within it, on its surface and in its atmosphere. The dynamic character of the Earth System is not only responsible for our own existence, but also for inevitable natural hazards. This course will introduce the Earth System as a basis for characterising and understanding natural hazards, their causes and consequences. The major types of natural hazard will be described, analysed and assessed in terms of their underlying causes as well as their socio-economic and environmental impacts. This course capitalises on natural synergies between subsurface, surface and human dimensions of the Earth System. Hazards to be considered will include earthquakes and tsunamis, volcanic hazards (local, regional and global scale), meteorological hazards (hurricanes, tornados, dust storms, El Nino, flooding and coastal erosion), topographic hazards such as landslides, and hazards arising from climate change. The evidence for past natural catastrophes and hazards, recorded in natural archives, will be described along with remote sensing methods for documenting current hazards and hazard risk. The principles and application of risk assessment and analysis will be considered with respect to case studies. The Course comprises 20 lectures supplemented by a series of laboratory classes, together with a directed programme of reading. The Course is assessed by degree examination together with a series of practical exercises.",

    "summary": "Oceanography  is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to all branches of Oceanography, namely physical, biological, chemical and geological oceanography, for science students. While introducing the basic principles the course also aims to provide a solid foundation for marine aspects of advanced courses in environmental sciences, geography, sedimentology, marine geology, ecology and meteorology. The course is formally divided into physical, biological, chemical and geological oceanography but the multi-disciplinary nature of ocean sciences is emphasized through out the course by highlighting the links between disciplines.In this course you will find out about ocean currents, both wind-driven surface currents and deep ocean currents driven by the effects of temperature and dissolved salts on water buoyancy. The oceans play an important part transporting heat from low to high latitudes to maintain a balance in the global heat budget. The biological part reviews the different life forms found in the oceans, looking particularly at issues relating to biological productivity and biological diversity, adaptation of life forms and differences between various marine ecosystems. The chemical part will look at the properties of water, the chemical make up of salt, the distribution of dissolved gases and nutrients in the ocean which are vital for life, and the biological and physical factors that govern their occurrence. This set of lectures will also tackle how the ocean functions as a self-regulating system while highlighting the unique role the ocean plays in maintaining Earth's climate to be hospitable. Human impact on the marine environment is also discussed. The geological oceanography deals with the structure and the development of ocean basins, their bedrock geology and the influx of sediments. How ocean circulation and climate changes of the past are recorded in ocean sediments and mineral resources are also discussed.",

Marine field studies include coral reef ecology and geomorphology, coastal oceanographic processes and water quality analysis. These will be supplemented by linked terrestrial studies, to include river and groundwater sampling and analyses and trips to investigate Jamaica's bauxite mining industry, the geology of the igneous Central inlier region, and karst processes in the Cockpit Country. Together these will provide insights on the natural and anthropogenic factors controlling river and groundwater composition, and impacts of groundwater discharge on offshore reefs.Field course locations may change for a variety of reasons, including security risks, increased costs or inability to access field locations. Any changes to the main destinations of the field course will be announced as soon as possible.",
    "course_description": "Background information and instructions for literature reviews are presented, along with extensive reading lists, during three introductory lectures at the start of semester 2 (dates TBC). There is also a tutorial to provide training in software that will later be used in Jamaica.Students then conduct independent reading and prepare literature reviews on three separate topics, to be submitted prior to the field trip. These dates are staggered across weeks 5-8, both to permit sufficient time for preparation and for marking and feedback prior to the field trip.The field trip takes place during a two-week period, near the end of and/or shortly after semester 2. Exact dates and travel arrangements depend on final student numbers, on flights and accommodation availability, and negotiating optimal group prices.

    "course_description": "This course encompasses key field training provided for 3rd year GPG students through delivery of field courses including:-\t2-week field course to Inchnadamph in NW Scotland (prior to start of S1)-\t9-day field course based around the geology and geomorphology of southern Spain, which may be replaced by a 7-day virtual field trip should travel restrictions not allow us to travel to Spain for educational purposes.  The trip will likely run during spring vacation, at some point between the 31st March and the 13th April 2025.These courses will teach a wide array of field skills, including geological and geomorphic mapping, identification of relevant geologic evidence, landscape interpretation, quantitative field and GIS based skills, and methods of data collection.The Inchnadamph trip aims to develop an understanding of the relationship between the surface and the subsurface and increases the ability of students to gather pertinent data from rock outcrops and surface features. The trip is broadly divided into two. A first week dedicated to the bedrock geology in terms of identifying lithologies, structural displacements, sedimentary environments and mapping. The mapping is over three days. The second week is dedicated to the geomorphology of the region, and the controls determined by the underlying geology. There are glacial exercises on mapping landforms, and a fluvial exercise that lasts 2 days.The Spain trip focuses on the development of Neogene and Quaternary sedimentary basins and associated landscape evolution in the Betic Cordillera in SE Spain. By the end of the Spain trip, students will have a broad and integrated knowledge and understanding of the Neogene and Quaternary evolution of SE Spain which will be gained through analysis of the sedimentology and geomorphology of the area studied. The principal learning outcomes of the Spain component of the course are the further development of key integrated skills based on a region that experiences active tectonics and fast erosion, which will assist students when they undertake their dissertation project. Students will learn how to exercise the autonomy and initiative required to conduct the independent project and will practice drawing on a range of sources to assist with making judgements. Should the trip be virtual, it will more heavily rely on the use of GIS-based techniques with online materials, but will aim to achieve similar learning outcomes.For up to date information regarding field trip costs and dates please go to:https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/teaching-organisation/ug-students/ug-field-trips",

    "summary": "This course presents an integrated approach to the processes that have driven environmental changes at various time scales during the Quaternary period. Discussed are the interactions between the oceans, ice sheets and continents and the way in which climate change drives/affects Earth surface processes. The archives that preserve records of environmental change on Earth on time scales of millions of years to decades are examined. Causes for environmental change through time are scrutinized in a global context. In addition to covering the general change in Earths climate over a longer period, there as a focus on the  last glaciation and the transition into the modern Holocene climate. The causes for environmental change will be studied from a marine and a continental perspective. Also, a computer simulation component will highlight the processes having driven past climate change in addition to assessing future climate states. Computer based practical sessions are an important part of the course and introduce techniques used in retrieving information on, and reconstructing, past environments from environmental archives (e.g. sediments, corals) and comparing data from different settings. As part of the practical sessions, transferable skills will be strengthened/generated. These include advanced graphic techniques, basic Excel/OpenOffice programming, training in text structuring, advanced text formatting techniques. Intense support during the practical classes is part of the course.Further Course Informationhttp://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/22-23/dpt/cxeasc09056.htm",

This course will teach not only a fundamental knowledge of the parameters that govern the relationship between stress and strain but put the rock response into a perspective that seamlessly ties in with material taught in related courses.The course introduces key concepts of structural geology and tectonic analyses. Over 10 weeks, a broad range of topics are covered, and the basics of the structural analysis of rocks is being conveyed. The course starts with the driving forces of rock deformation and its fundamental descriptors. It then covers the principal types of deformation structures before demonstrating the most relevant tectonic settings and their typical macro-, meso-, and microstructures. Specialist skills relevant to the topics covered each week are trained in practicals. Students furthermore consolidate and deepen their knowledge on structural geology and tectonics in an independent project. In that project they utilise their new skills and knowledge to summarise the deformation history of one of five deformed regions over seven weeks. The course follows entry level textbooks on Structural Geology.",
    "course_description": "The course exposes you to multi-scale data sets from a wide range of structural settings. The course runs over ten weeks, with lectures, practicals and tutorials each week. Each week is dedicated to a particular structural topic, which is introduced in the lectures and illustrated through well-chosen examples. The course covers a wide range of deformation processes and styles.In preparation for the thematic lectures and practicals, students are referred to selected chapters in textbooks to pick up the fundamental ideas of structural geology and tectonics, which are then applied in the classroom. Weekly practicals train skills relevant to the topic.In an independent project between weeks 3 and 10, you will engage with a topic of your choice that is relevant to structural geology. You will explore the topic using a selection of research papers and data. You will combine all of these materials in the preparation for your talks, which you will give in week 10.The learning materials are coordinated through LEARN, which also hosts a discussion forum that is monitored and moderated by academic staff.The course is delivered by two academic staff; Mikael Attal & Auriol Rae.SyllabusWeek 1: Deformation and strain (kinematics): How do we describe deformation?Week 2: Stress & Stress in the lithosphereWeek 3: Fracturing, faults, paleostressWeek 4: Rheology & Deformation at the microscale: How to best deal with stress under varying circumstances.Week 5: Shear zones, strain localization, mylonitesWeek 6: Foliations and LineationsWeek 7: Folding & BoudinageWeek 8: Contractional RegimesWeek 9: Extensional RegimesWeek 10: Strike-slip, transtension, transpression",

    "summary": "Hydrogeology, groundwater, is fascinating. Being able to understand where it comes from, how much there is, how the rocks and minerals influence its quality, how it flows through the ground is a skill set which is vital both from an environmental management perspective and for the maintenance and provision of a key resource to growing society today. From a ground engineering aspect, understanding groundwater flow and fluid pressure is essential.Students will gain a knowledge that covers and integrates most of the principal areas, features, boundaries, terminology and conventions of applied hydrogeology and the application of near surface geophysical techniques for the characterisation of the subsurface. They will gain an understanding of the principal theories, concepts and principles behind the development of conceptual hydrogeological models. They will cover a range of standard techniques for the investigation of hydrogeological parameters. They will be knowledgeable and skilled in the use of numerical data to solve issues in hydrogeology and near-surface geophysics.In addition they will be able to use both analytical and graphical techniques to predict the movement of groundwater and containment transport, as well as be able to produce water balances for catchment areas. Through group-based case studies on real life problems, which the students will present the applicability of the subject area, its use and its limit are demonstrated. Completing these projects will require the students to appreciate the distribution of groundwater in different hydrogeological environments, requiring a synoptic understanding of hard rock and surface geology, facies interpretation and material characteristics. Finally accompanying the lecture series, reference is made to the uncertainty particularly of conceptual models and their applicability.As well as understanding the importance of different near surface deposits, and the controls on fluid flow movement it is important to be able to know which techniques can be applied from the surface to investigate both the structure and makeup of the subsurface and also identify remotely the location of contaminants.  You will be given an overview of near surface geophysical techniques for aquifer characterisation and site investigation surveys. This will include the application of electromagnetic methods, including EM34, VLF, resistivity, self-potential and induced polarisation/complex resistivity methods, magnetic and gravity techniques, ground probing radar and near surface seismic refraction technics, and the utility of airborne techniques. The design of geophysical surveys for subsurface investigation will be covered (e.g. profile spacing, sampling rate along profile, depth of investigation of different techniques). Part of the assessment of this part of the course includes a practical component requiring data acquisition, modelling and interpretation. Prior to this, there is a formative assessment exercise based on a pre-existing dataset for one of the techniques used in the field.Attendance at lectures, the fieldwork data acquisition afternoon and practical classes is expected and a register will be maintained.Teaching will proceed via lectures, tutorials, and group work. Through group-based studies on real-world problems, students will gain experience in the applicability of the subject area, and the limitations of techniques.",

    "summary": "The ocean is vulnerable and its ecosystem function and services are under severe threat related to climate change. Ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation have global impact that can cascade through the food chain severely stressing ocean living resources which are already subject to multiple stressors of over exploitation, environmental degradation and habitat loss. Additionally, ocean plays a vital role in sequestering anthropogenic carbon but this uptake is expected to be impaired in uncertain ways due to these stresses in the medium and long term. The grand challenge facing scientists, policy-makers and the society at large is predicting, planning and mitigating for these changes. Meeting this grand challenge requires a clear understanding of the underpinning biogeochemical processes and cycles that mediate between physical changes and the ecosystems. The course will focus on these large scale marine biogeochemical cycles, discussing in depth the current evidence for change. The processes driving changes in the ocean ecosystem as a whole and potential mitigation practices will be discussed. The course aims to build on basic knowledge of marine sciences interrogating and placing these concepts in the context of current issues in marine science.",

A two-week field course in Spain (during spring vacation).These trips teach a wide array of field skills, including mapping, structural analysis and reconstruction, quantitative field techniques, and methods of data collection and integration.The Inchnadamph (NW Scotland) Field ComponentThe Inchnadamph field trip aims to develop an understanding of the relationship between surface and subsurface and increases the ability of students to gather pertinent data from rock outcrops and surface features. If the full field trip goes ahead (March 20th to April 3rd) the mapping work will be undertaken on two areas, one approximately 1.5km2 in size, in week 1 of the field trip; and the other about 3 km2 in size, in week 2 of the field trip. Students spend 8 days on work directly related to these mapping exercises, complemented by 3 days of supporting field investigation. Two days are devoted to data analysis and report production.Online learning modules that will precede (1, 2) or replace (3) the Inchnadamph field trip is not able to be run Â¿liveÂ¿ will include:Online module 1 [OM1] (available from week 8, Semester prior to the field course):a)\tIntroduction to the areas to be investigated, overview of the geology, key sites;b)\tExample exercises utilising the basic principles and methods (stratum contours on planar features, cross-sections)c)\tPrinciples of the field notebookOnline module 2 [OM2] (available from week 8, Semester prior to the field course):a)\tPrinciples of field maps and documenting information on them.b)\tConstruction of a geological map based on given information (Grid referenced locations of boundaries, dip and dip direction information, photos of localities, sparse outcrop data, compiled photo sheets etc.).c)\tProducing a true-scale cross-section of the mapped area along a given azimuth.d)\tStructural exercise Â¿ elements of a fold, use of stereonets to represent the information, steronet interpretation, construction of a block diagram based on map and structural data.Online Module 3 [OM3] (available in lieu of field course itself):Assessed exercises comparable to those in OM2 b) and c), based on partial geological maps of the Ullapool River Valley complemented by locality descriptions, panoramas, fly-throughs, and rock unit images (including hand specimens, and thin section images).Spain (or UK equivalent) Field ComponentThe second section of this course will normally involve a 2-week fieldtrip to Spain. The Spain field trip focuses on the development of Neogene and Quaternary sedimentary basins and associated magmatic and tectonic activity in the Betic Cordillera in SE Spain. The field course is skills-based, but students will also gain a broad and integrated knowledge and understanding of the Neogene and Quaternary evolution of SE Spain which will be gained through analysis of the tectonic, volcanic, and sedimentological history of the area.If international travel is not possible, this will be replaced by either a residential UK field trip, or Edinburgh-based day fieldtrips which explore the geological evolution of the Midland Valley.Further Information on the content of the Field CoursesThe field courses will, individually and collectively, improve understanding of geological processes with an emphasis on interpreting rocks at the outcrop and regional scale. A wide range of igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks will be studied, and training will be given in the field identification of rocks, and the interpretation of deformation, sedimentary sequences, and a range of igneous and metamorphic phenomena. All of the observations made in the field will be gathered together through the construction of maps, cross sections and, for Spain, a rock-relation diagram.You will undertake geological mapping exercises that will integrate observations from multiple scales. You will be trained in various field techniques including digital mapping and model building as well as microstructural exercises on samples from the field area. The principal learning outcomes are the further development of key field skills. You will develop a good sense for uncertainty in geological field observations and develop skills in 4-dimensional model building.  These skills are essential for students that undertake independent mapping project.You will learn how to exercise the autonomy and initiative required to conduct independent field work and will practise drawing on a range of sources to assist with making judgements.You will also be trained in personal presentation skills of your field observations and interpretations, as well as group and team-working, and professional practice.***Field course locations may change for a variety of reasons, including security risks, increased costs or inability to access field locations. Any changes to the main destination of the field course will be announced as soon as possible.***",

FEC fosters a deep-Earth (solid Earth processes)/deep-time orientated view of the Earth and its differentiation, with a focus on the formation of the EarthÂ¿s crust, culminating in the development and growth of continents.",
    "course_description": "The Course in 2024 will be delivered live. A blended learning environment will be employed only as back-up.Six themes will be developed, spaced over 10 weeks of semester 1. Lecture presentations will be supported by live recordings, reading focused on specific aspects of each theme, student-led discussions, and brief live sessions that will link the lectures and go on to synthesise those for each theme. Students should engage with the live lecture sessions and any thematic online presentations for around 4-5 hours each week.Lectures will be structured to introduce and address key questions in each theme. Each lecture will culminate in one (or more) key questions that students will then be able to address through reading of designated literature. Each theme will conclude with a short (live) session that utilises the previously presented material and the students' learning to arrive at an understanding of the current state of knowledge of the theme, including the outstanding questions that remain.Each lecture is supported by PowerPoint notes and each theme by keynote references that are selected to complement and extend the lecture content, provide further insights into concepts and models, and enhance student knowledge and appreciation of underlying data. These are deposited as pdfs on the LEARN site for the course, along with all lecture materials and background information.The FEC course is designed to be \"state-of-the-art\" in terms of content. Hence, students are expected to engage in 60 hours of independent reading and supplementary study, guided by the keynote papers provided and focussed on the central questions related to each theme and discussed in live Collaborate or Media Hopper sessions.",

    "course_description": "The British Isles have a remarkably varied geological history for such a small fragment of continental crust, with an extraordinary rock record back stretching through three billion years of Earth History. This geological evolution would have been interesting enough if it had been played out on relatively stable continental crust. However, the British Isles have developed at a tectonic crossroads, on crust once traversed by subduction zones and volcanic arcs, continental rifts and mountain belts. The resulting geological complexity is instructive, fascinating and perplexing. This is further enhanced by the northwards drift of the province throughout its geological history, meaning that the majority of the geological history of the planet is represented within the stratigraphy of the British Isles.LecturesWeek 11. Introduction to course objectives, revision of the principles of stratigraphy (bio, chrono and litho) and basin analysis along with a summary of the Lewisian rocks of NW Scotland within their palaeographic contextWeek 22.

    "course_description": "This course provides an honours-level introduction to inverse theory and its use in a variety of geophysical contexts. It also provides an introduction to direct imaging methods, which image the Earth's subsurface without using inverse theory.The inverse theory part of the course begins with some simplified examples which are either linear inverse problems or can be treated as such. These problems are essentially the solution of simultaneous equations, often with either more or fewer equations than there are unknowns; a variety of methods are presented for finding useful solutions to problems with fewer equations than unknowns. While some methods discussed are ad-hoc, the inverse problem is also considered from the Bayesian probabilistic point of view. Several techniques for assessing the usefulness of the solution to an inverse problem are covered. Extensions of the linear techniques to moderately nonlinear problems are described next, followed by the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (an explicitly Bayesian approach) for very nonlinear problems.The imaging part of the course surveys a variety of geophysical techniques, including gravity, magnetics, electromagnetics and resistivity, before providing a detailed description of reflection seismology. The practicalities of marine and land-based seismic surveys are considered. The theoretical background of reflection seismology is described, along with the data processing sequence. The use of Fourier transforms for filtering is described. The course concludes with migration-based seismic processing, which images the subsurface without solving an explicit inverse problem.The two parts of the course are linked in various ways: inverse theory is required for the understanding of some aspects of the imaging material, and the imaging material provides a variety of examples used in the inverse theory part of the course. The direct imaging methods are essentially computationally tractable approximations to the full inverse solution for subsurface imaging.",

This is particularly relevant for hydrocarbon exploration and production, has importance for CO2 permanent storage, sites of short duration methane and hydrogen storage, and can also help understand deep aquifers within sedimentary basins. Depositional features of a sediment strongly control its porosity and permeability. Subsequently during burial, the mineralogy and physical arrangement of sedimentary grains is changed by compaction, geochemical reactions, and fluid flow. That has a systematic impact on spaces between the grains - porosity holding fluids, and permeability enabling flow of fluids. Course themes are divided into Sandstones and Carbonates. Each theme progresses from depositional and shallow burial effects, to processes during deeper burial. Shallow burial (dis)similarities will be explained as will deep burial contrasts and similarities between sandstones and carbonates.",
    "course_description": "The topics are unusual in spanning size scales from micro to macro, and in the integration from surface processes and depositional geology  to deep burial geochemistry and long timescale rock mechanics controlled by fluid pressures. Firstly the basin setting and gross depositional and basin architecture, which affects the input detrital mix. Second, the depositional environments produce reservoir scale (in)homogeneities. Thirdly, the cementation and dissolution effects at the pore scale, with integration of geological setting, basin modelling, geochemical measurements fluid flow and (over) pressure, and petrological measurements. The emphasis is on processes during geological timescales, which aims to communicate that the shallow to deep underground is affected by continually changing dynamic processes. Typically one-third of \"solid\" rock is re-located during the pathway to deep burial. This will help understand how to predict the location and timing of good, or poor, quality porosity and permeability within a sedimentary basin.",

    "summary": "Hydrogeology, groundwater, is fascinating. Being able to understand where it comes from, how much there is, how the rocks and minerals influence its quality, how it flows through the ground is a skill set which is vital both from an environmental management perspective and for the maintenance and provision of a key resource to growing society today. From a ground engineering aspect, understanding groundwater flow and fluid pressure is essential. Students will gain a knowledge that covers and integrates most of the fundamental areas, features, boundaries, terminology and conventions of applied hydrogeology. The principle theories and concepts behind the development of conceptual hydrogeological models will be addressed. A range of standard techniques for the investigation of hydrogeological parameters is covered. Students will be knowledgeable and skilled in the use of numerical data to solve issues in hydrogeology. They will be able to use both analytical and graphical techniques to predict the movement of groundwater and contaminant transport, as well as be able to produce water balances for catchment areas. Through group-based case studies on real life problems, which the students will present, the applicability of the subject area, its use and its limits are demonstrated. Completing these projects will require the students to appreciate the distribution of groundwater in different hydrogeological environments, requiring a synoptic understanding of hardrock and surface geology, facies interpretation and material characteristics. Reference is made to the parameter uncertainty and its impact in terms of risk.",

    "summary": "Marine (coastal and ocean) environments are fundamental features of the Earth system that are profoundly influenced by human interactions. As these ecosystems are trans-boundary and multi-dimensional the policy instruments governing the utilization of coastal ocean systems are complex. However, policies, laws and regulations are often disconnected to the scale and dynamics of targeted ecosystems and species in both time and space (e.g. oceanographic processes, migratory species, multi-site life stages). Many global to local scale policies can be more effective, support deeper understanding of ecosystem processes, and take into account cumulative impacts of social pressures and environmental change, when viewed through an ecosystem lens from the past and looking ahead. Additionally, as technology advances, human population increases and energy demands combine to extend the horizons of marine exploration and exploitation further offshore, a robust understanding of policies impacts and ecology responses in coastal-ocean realms is increasingly vital.This course uses case studies to gain an understanding of marine conservation measure and spatial planning to explore linkages between different scales of coastal-ocean ecosystem processes and ecological dynamics in connection with applicable scales of policy instruments (e.g. Law of the Sea, Convention of Biodiversity, UNESCO World Heritage; regional conventions; Local codes and policies framed around fishing regulations, coastal zoning, and traditional knowlege). Diverse case studies across a range of biomes, scales, and issues are considered to examine and test the suitability of different policies for different ecosystem scales, environmental issues and socio-cultural contexts. Examples of case study scales include: Archipelagos and Islands, Estuaries, Semi-enclosed Seas, Continental Margins, Polar Seas, and Global Oceans.While most courses in GeoSciences are terrestrial in orientation, this course is focuses on marine ecosystems, issues and policies in an integrated way that provides foundational learning for critical analysis of marine environments and human impacts. This course will help prepare students for positions in governments, NGOs, environmental consultancies and private enterprise requiring competency at the science-policy interface.(Note: This course is co-taught as a 20c course for (PGT only) and 10c for a small number of fourth year Env GeoScience and Ecology, with joint lecture sessions. The PGT 20c has additional discussion groups and journal response assignments. Group Presentations will be presented by both 10c and 20c groupings, with all attending. Both 10c and 20c will have individual policy position papers.)",

    "summary": "Managing nuclear waste, both that already in existence and in prospect from past nuclear power generation (legacy waste) and waste likely to be produced from future nuclear power programmes, is a major environmental and socioeconomic issue both within the UK and globally. With a number of countries now at various stages of committing to the geological disposal of nuclear waste it is timely to consider the management of nuclear waste in a holistic manner and evaluate the issues that surround geological disposal and other options for waste management, both in the UK and internationally.The course will introduce students to nuclear waste, from its production in the context of nuclear fuel cycle to its treatment, storage and disposal. Whilst firmly based within the UK waste management context, the course will also introduce and review the international legal, regulatory, research and disposal concept environments and frameworks for nuclear waste management.Students will gain a thorough grounding in the national and international context of nuclear waste, from its production to management. They will gain a critical awareness and understanding of the scientific, economic, environmental, social and policy issues surrounding this important subject. They will gain insight into the concept of Safety Cases, and the role of geoscientific knowledge and understanding in developing these. Finally, they will become familiar with the arguments surrounding screening and siting as well as community engagement and volunteerism in developing one or more GDFs in the UK.",
    "course_description": "This course will have three component parts.The first will be the taught component.This will be provided through a series of 5 lecture and discussion sessions presented from Week 4 of the semester and concluding with a session on R&D developments in Week 8.The default format will be lectures given as timetabled face-to-face discussion sessions.  Lectures will use conventional powerpoints with supporting written commentaries, and subtitles where relevant, complemented by video clips. Both will be accessed and referred to in the online sessions or the face-to-face lecture / discussion sessions.The second component will consist of the following:A Question Time style panel debate on one or more of the key issues surrounding the Implementing Geological Disposal programme in the UK. This is scheduled to occur in week 9 of semester. It will be a hybrid face-to-face (students and UoE staff) / online (UK and overseas expert panellists) event within a timetabled session. The Panel will most likely include representatives from national Waste Management Organisations, including UK WMO (Nuclear Waste Services, NWS) and one or more of NAGRA (Switzerland), BGE (Germany) and Posiva (Finland) or SKB (Sweden). An independent international expert will also act as a panellist.The third component will be the Student Poster Presentation Event.Students will select one from a suite of relevant nuclear waste topics on which they will prepare a poster and present that poster within a dedicated, conference style, \"Poster Session\". The topics will include those that trace and assess the state of nuclear waste management in specific countries, and others that focus on cross-cutting themes such as screening, siting, geosphere characterisation, key R&D topics, URLs, and issues associated with developing a GDF.The taught part of the Course will begin with an overview of nuclear power generation, the production of wastes, and the national and international regulatory and legal frameworks for nuclear waste management. The variety of waste types, their treatment and storage options, and the research and development issues associated with these will be outlined, leading to an understanding of radioactive waste inventories, especially for final disposal. The options for the disposal of nuclear waste, including near-surface disposal and deep borehole disposal, will be introduced, leading to a detailed analysis of deep geological disposal in conceptual Geological Disposal Facilities (GDFs).Safety Cases for GDFs in the main prospective rock types will be introduced, leading to an analysis of the roles of engineered barriers and the geological barrier in the three main disposal concepts. The requirements for subsurface characterisation to support safe geological disposal and importance of Underground Research Laboratories in this will be explained. The significance of natural analogues for Safety Case arguments will also be explored.Having developed an understanding of the scientific, regulatory and safety issues surrounding nuclear waste management, the course will progress students through the key issues associated with finding, selecting and selling a Geological Disposal Facility to communities and the public. Approaches to this in the UK and other nations will be examined. Public understanding and acceptance issues associated with volunteerism, engagement, community benefit, decision-making and rights of withdrawal will be introduced. The role of geology and geological information will be further discussed with respect to screening, site identification, site selection and site assessment. The current approach to implementing geological disposal (IGD) in the UK will be highlighted and compared with both previous attempts (UK) and approaches being adopted elsewhere.The detailed course content, which should be noted as being indicative rather than definitive, is provided below.First Week (Week 4 of Semester 2):Introduction and Framework: Introduction to the Course: aims, approach, organisation.

    "summary": "Hydrocarbon resources have fuelled the Western-World lifestyle for around 100 years, yet global climate change threatens the prosperity, if not the survival, of mankind and many other species. A move from using the subsurface from a source of hydrocarbons to the disposal of waste CO2 (in carbon capture and storage) and energy storage is essential for the energy transition. Prospecting for old resources (oil, gas) and new (geological storage) requires a high degree of understanding of both geological and geophysical aspects of basin exploration, and particularly the interplay between these two disciplines. Subsurface exploration provides many intellectual challenges, interpreting the subsurface, based in limited (and very expensive) data to optimise resource recovery or utilisation requires a deep understanding of geology and geophysics, with prediction into data-poor areas a key skill. Fortunately, the knowledge and techniques developed for hydrocarbon exploration are transferable to the more sustainable geoenergy technologies.The course utilises a variety of teaching methods:Lectures and practical classes cover the petroleum system and other subsurface usage, and the application of geophysical techniques to exploration.Interpretation of seismic reflection profiles of a sedimentary succession at the basin margin near Helmsdale using state-of-the-art digital software (Petrel) and seismic data, kindly donated by Schlumberger.A 4 day field excursion to Helmsdale (NE Scotland) to study rocks analogous to those used in the subsurface.",

The focus will be on cutting edge palaeontological and geobiological research topics and controversies, particularly those that are being researched by Edinburgh-based scientists. The first five course sessions will each focus on a particular integrative topic. Students will be given a selection of primary literature to read before each session. The session will begin with a short lecture on the week's topic, in which the subject is described, the work being actively undertaken in Edinburgh is summarised, and the primary methods used to the study the topic are outlined. Following the lecture there will be a discussion of the lecture and literature readings, which will then be followed by either a practical exercise in which students get first-hand experience with the research techniques discussed in the lecture, or a group discussion of continuing controversies. Groups and individuals may be asked to make informal oral presentations. The sixth session, if possible under current government guidelines, will be a local fieldtrip in which students identify fossils in the field, use those fossils to reconstruct ancient environments, and produce a field report. The date for the field trip will be determined by tide times and mutual convenience.",

    "summary": "MEarthPhys students undertake a major 5th year project in Geophysics and/or meteorology, spread over two semesters. These projects can be drawn from a diverse range (reflecting staff research interests). Many involve interfacing with existing software for analysing data, using a variety of programming languages. Building on such existing software is often essential to meaningful progress in the research project. No programming language has been identified as a standard that all students can be taught and that would serve for all potential projects. Furthermore, the only language that students have been taught so far is an interpreted data-analysis language. A professional scientist should also have been exposed to traditional compiled languages (C, Fortran etc.) and should understand some of the differences between the two types of language. Some, but not all, students will therefore be faced with a significant need to gain skills in programming as well as learning the geophysics/meteorology relevant to their project. This course is intended to ensure due credit is available to students for achieving that up-skilling in scientific computing, while allowing all project work to be assessed on a common basis (i.e., assuming no limitations arising from difficulty in acquiring computing skills). Students will thus take this course as a means of gaining the scientific computing skills that are necessary to the performance of their level 11 research project,  i.e., they will follow an individually agreed approach to learning the programming language necessary for their project. The approach to learning could include auditing or taking courses within the University where relevant and available (in which case credits would not be double counted). More commonly, a number of reasonably demanding tasks will be devised requiring data reading, data manipulation and programming of mathematical operations. Each student will develop code in both a compiled language and a data-analysis language in order to achieve their agreed tasks in their particular programming environments, the scale of the tasks being intended to require ~200 hours of effort. Where the student's project does not require both a compiled and a data-analysis language, the languages to be used will be selected by the CO. As well as providing students with scientific computing experience explicitly on their transcript, the student experience should be enhanced in that students will not be dissuaded from choosing projects requiring mature computing skills.",

    "course_description": "The complex nature of the world's ecosystems arises from the inter-relationships between the physical environment, ecology and human intervention. The course structure reflects this interaction between soil, water and atmospheric processes within environmental systems. We begin with the inputs to the system of energy (radiation) and water (precipitation). Next the internal dynamics of the environmental system are examined (including topics of soil composition and properties, soil moisture and groundwater). Finally we cover the system outputs - water in gaseous and liquid form (as evaporation to the atmosphere and river runoff).The majority of the course focuses on developing a sound understanding of the physical and chemical processes that occur in the soil, atmosphere and freshwaters at the sub-regional scale. Case study lectures are interspersed amongst process-based lectures to demonstrate why an understanding of soil, water and atmospheric processes is required for effective environmental management.Through the course lectures, practicals and tutorials we will also begin to quantify soil, water and atmosphericprocesses as a basis for estimating environmental resources (such as water availability or nutrients for plant growth) and predicting the effects of environmental change. By the end of the course you will have an improved understanding of the world around you and will be better equipped to analyse environmental systems in a scientific manner.The course is relevant to all those with an interest in how environmental systems function: from whole organism biologists and ecologists to geologists and environmental chemists.",

    "course_description": "Population ecology is the study of how populations of plants, animals, and other organisms change over time and space and interact with their environment.The course is broken down into three parts:Population BiologySpecies InteractionsCommunity EcologyWe start at the simplest level: how environmental factors influence the growth of a single species population. We then add further complexity by examining how interactions between species affect their growth. Finally, we study the interactions of whole groups of species that make up communities.Populations are groups of organisms of the same species living in the same area at the same time. They are described by characteristics that include:- population size: the number of individuals in the population- population density: how many individuals are in a particular area- population growth: how the size of the population is changing over time.If population growth is just one of many population characteristics, what makes studying it so important?First, studying how and why populations grow (or shrink) helps scientists make better predictions about future changes in population sizes and growth rates. This is essential for answering questions in areas such as biodiversity conservation (e.g., the polar bear population is declining, but how quickly, and when will it be so small that the population is at risk for extinction?) and human population growth (e.g., how fast will the human population grow, and what does that mean for climate change, resource use, and biodiversity?).Studying population growth also helps scientists understand what causes changes in population sizes and growth rates. For example, fisheries scientists know that some salmon populations are declining, but do not necessarily know why. Are salmon populations declining because they have been overfished by humans? Has salmon habitat disappeared? Have ocean temperatures changed causing fewer salmon to survive to maturity? Or, maybe even more likely, is it a combination of these things? If scientists do not understand what is causing the declines, it is much more difficult for them to do anything about it. Learning what is probably not affecting a population can be as informative as learning what is.Finally, studying population growth gives scientists insight into how organisms interact with each other and with their environments. This is especially meaningful when considering the potential impacts of climate change and other changes in environmental factors (how will populations respond to changing temperatures? To drought? Will one population prosper after another declines?).A community is a group of interacting species that inhabit a particular location at a particular time. Community ecologists study the number of species in a particular location and ask why the number of species changes over time. They also study communities in different locations, and ask why the number of species differs with location.How does the depth of a lake influence the complexity of the community living within it? Why do some places contain more species than others?Community ecology seeks to answer these and other questions about communities. An ecological community is a group of actually or potentially interacting species living in the same location. Communities are bound together by a shared environment and a network of influence each species has on the other.Community ecology is an expanding and rich subfield of ecology. Ecologists investigate the factors that influence biodiversity, community structure, and the distribution and abundance of species. These factors include interactions with the abiotic world and the diverse array of interactions that occur between species. Species interactions, including competition, predation, herbivory, parasitism and mutualisms, are the basis for most of the research in community ecology. Questions of interest include: What are the feeding relationships among species? Who competes with whom and for what resources? Does the presence of some species benefit others?Food webs are a graphical depiction of the interconnections among species based on feeding relationships, and are a core concept of the field. The role of keystone species in communities is another important tenet, and one of the best-known ideas in community ecology. Keystone species are those whose presence or absence profoundly affects other species in the community, disproportionately to its abundance.A central feature of Population and Community Ecology is the use of mathematical models for describing and understanding how populations and communities change. The course therefore introduces some simple models, derived from first principles. We then demonstrate how they help us in our understanding, particularly when they break down thereby forcing us to consider possible alternative explanations.Computer modelling is also an important tool for population biologists in forecasting population numbers (for example fish stocks, or species re-introductions). The first practical introduces simple computer models of populations facing extinction and examines what conservation efforts might alleviate the risk of extinction. A report will be written about this practical and assessed.Communities are strongly influenced by their physical environment. Before attempting to unravel the mechanisms that might underlie differences among communities, we must first find ways to describe and compare communities, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The fantastic communities of micro-organisms that live on bog mosses of the genus Sphagnum are a good model system in which to learn about these techniques. The second practical introduces measures of species diversity, and how to collect data to calculate them. A report will be written about this practical and assessed.",

    "summary": "Addressing global environmental challenges involves understanding the complex relationships between humans and the natural world. This course will provide students coming from a natural sciences background with an introduction to the social sciences, focused on understanding the breadth of ways in which social science research contributes to understanding and addressing environmental challenges, and developing a conceptual and practical understanding of key research methods that are commonly used to answer questions about humans' relationships to their environments.",
    "course_description": "The course will focus on developing an understanding of the breadth and diversity of topics and approaches that fall within 'the social sciences' and the contributions that the social sciences make to solving environmental challenges, and providing students with a practical grounding in the use of common social science research methods. It is intended for students with a background in the natural sciences who are keen to develop their ability to work across disciplinary boundaries or as part of interdisciplinary teams. It will also provide an excellent grounding for students who wish to incorporate social science techniques into their dissertation research.Across ten weeks, the course will address the following questions:What are 'the social sciences', and why should I care about them?What is different about social science research? (and what is not?)How can I take care to ensure that my research is ethical?How can I use interviews and focus groups to explore topics in depth?How can I design and use questionnaires effectively?How can I use existing documents or texts in research?How should I analyse the data I have collected?Students will be helped to answer them by exploring a set of focal themes - environmental attitudes, human wellbeing and justice - which will be used throughout the course to introduce core concepts that are particularly important in the social sciences (e.g. the role of theory, latent and multidimensional constructs, positionality, different philosophies of knowledge) and to explore when and how a natural scientist might have to think differently about topics they will already be familiar with (e.g. sampling, measurement).The course is designed to encourage active learning and uses a flipped classroom approach. Each week the students will be provided with a set of learning materials and associated tasks which they will be asked to review and complete in advance of a three hour timetabled session. The classes will build directly on this preparatory work, using a mixture of lecture content, facilitated group discussion, class presentations, and other interactive activities.",

    "graduate_attributes_and_skills": "The course complements, builds upon and extends the skills training currently offered within the EES programme several ways. First, it encourages students to actively explore the complexity and ambiguity that is an inherent part of studying and tackling environmental challenges (e.g. through examination of the concepts of wellbeing and justice). Second, it includes a significant focus on developing an appreciation of the ethical issues that can arise when studying human relationships with the natural world, and the ability to understand when and how to apply relevant social science methods. Third, through the concepts of positionality and reflexivity, it introduces students to the importance of critical self-reflection.The delivery methods used in the course are also chosen to develop a broad range of personal and professional skills in students that take it. The classes are designed to be highly interactive, and will promote analytical and critical thinking by encouraging students to actively explore the subject. The course assessments are intended to develop skills in team working and verbal communication and presentation, through the creation and presentation of the learning packs, and to provide students with an opportunity to design and conduct a piece of independent research prior to their dissertations, further developing skills in independent learning and problem solving and written communication.",

You will learn how models can help test and generate new hypotheses to understand ecosystem functions. You will be challenged to formulate testable hypotheses, and design suitable models of differing complexity, including both discrete (i.e. individual-based) and continuous (i.e. pool-based) approaches. Existing real-world applicable terrestrial ecosystem models (e.g. DALEC) will be used to test student-created hypotheses of ecosystem function in response to external factors (i.e. climate and disturbance).The course will consist of 10 three-hour sessions.

    "summary": "Marine (coastal and ocean) environments are fundamental features of the Earth system that are profoundly influenced by human interactions. As these ecosystems are trans-boundary and multi-dimensional the policy instruments governing the utilization of coastal ocean systems are complex. However, policies, laws and regulations are often disconnected to the scale and dynamics of targeted ecosystems and species in both time and space (e.g. oceanographic processes, migratory species, multi-site life stages). Many global to local scale policies can be more effective, support deeper understanding of ecosystem processes, and take into account cumulative impacts of social pressures and environmental change, when viewed through an ecosystem lens from the past and looking ahead. Additionally, as technology advances, human population increases and energy demands combine to extend the horizons of marine exploration and exploitation further offshore, a robust understanding of policies impacts and ecology responses in coastal-ocean realms is increasingly vital.This course uses case studies to gain an understanding of marine conservation measure and spatial planning to explore linkages between different scales of coastal-ocean ecosystem processes and ecological dynamics in connection with applicable scales of policy instruments (e.g. Law of the Sea, Convention of Biodiversity, UNESCO World Heritage; regional conventions; Local codes and policies framed around fishing regulations, coastal zoning, and traditional knowlege). Diverse case studies across a range of biomes, scales, and issues are considered to examine and test the suitability of different policies for different ecosystem scales, environmental issues and socio-cultural contexts. Examples of case study scales include: Archipelagos and Islands, Estuaries, Semi-enclosed Seas, Continental Margins, Polar Seas, and Global Oceans.While most courses in GeoSciences are terrestrial in orientation, this course is focuses on marine ecosystems, issues and policies in an integrated way that provides foundational learning for critical analysis of marine environments and human impacts. This course will help prepare students for positions in governments, NGOs, environmental consultancies and private enterprise requiring competency at the science-policy interface.(Note: This course is co-taught as a 20c course for (PGT only) and 10c for a small number of fourth year Env GeoScience and Ecology, with joint lecture sessions. The PGT 20c has additional discussion groups and journal response assignments. Group Presentations will be presented by both 10c and 20c groupings, with all attending. Both 10c and 20c will have individual policy position papers.)",
    "course_description": "The first part of the course has lectures on different marine biomes, followed by exemplary case studies from academic staff and guest lectures from government and NGO organizations. Together these illustrate a range of issues and societal contexts through which different policies will be examined.

    "summary": "This course offers an introduction to Archaeology, focusing on case-studies from Eurasian later prehistory and beyond. It discusses themes such as the rise of early states, monumentality, urbanism, and death and burial. It offers insights into the workings of archaeological research and interpretation through addressing key theoretical perspectives and methods.",
    "course_description": "The course has several themes: Theme 1 (understanding early civilisations) introduces the course and gives you some useful background to the history of Archaeology and aspects of relevant theory and interpretation. It provides a background to understand the rise of early civilisations in Western Asia and Egypt, focusing on the birth of writing, state formation, and the rise of markets and trade. Theme 2 (scientific archaeology) highlights useful applications in archaeological research for studying artifacts and human skeletal remains. Theme 3 (monuments and megaliths) addresses how archaeological science has been able to make sense of Stonehenge, BritainÂ¿s most famous prehistoric monument; and other European megaliths. Theme 4 (European societies from the Bronze Age to the Medieval period) introduces a range of Later Prehistoric and post-Roman societies of Europe, addressing the specifics of their lifeways and the rise of urbanism. The course concludes with the archaeology of the Roman frontiers and Medieval Britain. Many of these topics, as well as several others, can be pursued in further depth in Archaeology 2A and 2B, and in Honours option classes (3-4th years).There are normally two 1-hour lectures per week and one tutorial per week starting in week 3. Tutorials provide a friendly small group learning context of about 10-12 students. They complement lectures, web pages and textbooks, while helping you develop the skills required for tackling the assessments upon which your final grade depends. Tutorials provide a context for discussion of lecture topics and critical evaluation of selected reading items. They also introduce key themes and issues, while allowing you to ask questions about any aspect of Archaeology that you wish to know more about or need help with. Active contribution and participation is required of all students.",

It goes on to survey the Renaissance in Britain and northern Europe and the subsequent influence of the Italian Baroque in these areas.

Semester 1 concludes with an examination of the theoretical, cultural, and stylistic aspects of the architecture of the European Enlightenment.Semester 2 opens with a survey of the stylistic revivals that dominated architecture in the early nineteenth century. It also introduces the apparently contradictory theme of modernity in architecture and discusses the nineteenth century development of new and more sophisticated typologies along with the new materials and technologies that made this possible. The revivalist and the modern are also discussed in terms of the conflict between industrial and anti-industrial that saw the architectural technology of the Crystal Palace juxtaposed with the emergence of the Arts and Crafts Movement. The course traces the complex ideas that lie behind the emergence of Modernism in the early decades of the 20th century. It concludes with lectures on the revision of Modernism in the 1950's and 60's and the recent emergence of a Post-modern consciousness.Throughout the course the development of building technology and the social, religious, and political understanding of buildings are recurring themes.

The course will have a primary focus on the materials of which the Earth is made, how the major constituents are distributed between core, mantle and crust and how this changes with time through the agencies of plate tectonics and volcanism. Geological resources, from energy, to minerals, and water, are essential for all aspects of society.

    "course_description": "Please note this course is not available for Visiting students.Environmental geochemistry is about the sources, distribution and interactions of chemical species in the earth system, covering rocks, minerals, soil, water and biology. The surface environment has dominant controls on these interactions because the exposure of minerals to water and biology has the effect speeding up many geological reactions. In this course, we focus on natural waters because the mobility and speciation of chemical elements in natural wasters is central to many of the feedbacks that connect geochemical, biological, and geological processes at Earth's surface.The course is delivered in the form of lectures, geochemical laboratory practical  and field trips, the latter designed to showcase the practical applications of your theoretical understanding. Topics/lectures include (1) Controls on the composition of natural waters and classification, role of colloids and their surface chemistry in contolling water composition, energy demand for geochemical reactions and reaction pathways, metabolic pathways exploited by micro-organisms and higher organisms and their impact on nutrient and organic matter (carbon cycling) in the environment, and material cycling in estuarine environments. One weekend field trip to Keswick (lake district) and a day trip to Seafield Pond (near Dunbar). Taken together, these approaches will equip you with vital skills in (i) field observations, (ii) geochemical analysis coupled with data analysis and modelling, leading to (iii) robust scientific interpretation and professional/scientific reporting.Course content(1) Controls on the composition of natural waters and classification(2) Forms of natural dissolved substances in natural waters(3) Colloids/ mineral surface chemistry surface adsorption reactions(4) Geochemical reactions, reaction pathways and rate determining reactions(5) Sources of energy for natural reactions in the natural environments(6) Autotrophic Metabolism: Living off sunlight and inorganic substances(7) Heterotrophic metabolism: Living off organic compounds(8) Organic matter cycling in natural environments(9) Estuarine Environments10) Estuarine Circulation(11) Estuarine Sedimentation(12) Estuarine Chemistry: Basics(13) Estuarine Chemistry: Metals(14) Estuarine Chemistry: Carbon(15) Estuarine Chemistry: Nitrogen(16) Human Impacts on Estuaries /revisionhttps://path.is.ed.ac.uk/courses/EASC08024_SS1_SEM1http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/current/dpt/cxeasc08024.htm***** Fieldwork *****There will be two compulsory field trips for this course1.\tAfternoon trip to (Seafield Pond) Dunbar date to be confirmed2.\tWeekend field trip to Lake District (Keswick)  18 October - 20 October 2024",

    "summary": "This course is intended as a foundation course for all Earth Science students with emphasis on processes that operate at the global scale. The interactions between geology, chemistry, physics and biology affecting the origin and evolution of life, Earth surface processes, and the climate history of the planet are studied. These together form the characteristics of the environment in which we live.This course should also be of general interest to Biology students by providing a thorough basis for understanding the geological aspects of global environmental change, and in particular, the evolution of life in this context. Chemists will benefit from an application of basic chemical principles to complex natural systems, while the course also provides an important background for those interested in temporal phenomena e.g. archaeologists.The course will consist of four main components:The first part (4 weeks by Dr Stephen Brusatte) will present the evolution of the Earth in general and of life in particular. The roles of the atmosphere and geosphere on changes in the biosphere are discussed, emphasising the driving mechanisms (internal and external forcing) for change. Significant events in earth history are considered, including the origin of life, geochemical evolution of the atmosphere, and mass extinctions. After covering this module, students will be able to recall the main features of the evolution of the planet and life on earth.The second section (2 weeks by Dr. Alex Thomas) introduces the concept of global climate change across a spectrum of time-scales from many millions of years to inter-annual variations. The emphasis is on identifying the main processes that control climate variability and change on these different time-scales, and on using examples from Earth history to illustrate how these processes may interact. This leads to the concept of the climate system; a complex coupled system where components may interact to either enhance or reduce any initial change in climate. Natural processes including those related to tectonic activity, weathering of rocks, changes in solar output, changes in the EarthÂ¿s orbit around the sun, and natural auto-oscillations, in the climate system (such as El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation) are considered, as well as Anthropogenic processes of climate change related to changing greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations in the atmosphere. From this module students will be able to recall the main timescales on which climate change occurs, and will be able to account for these scales of change with reference to current understanding on the topic. They will be able to assess the degree to which recent climate change is exceptional compared to previous times, and will understand the significance and reliability of future predictions based on climate model results.The third part (2 weeks by Dr. Geoff Bromiley) is a basic introduction to the foundations of chemistry that underpins our fundamental understanding of natural chemical reactions. The course assumes very little chemistry and starts from first principles (fundamental building blocks of matter) to chemical reactions and what drives them. The lectures will run in parallel with assessed laboratory practical sessions designed to consolidate the application of the chemical concepts to natural substances/processes. On completion of this module, students will acquire a solid grasp of chemical principles upon which to build their chemistry skills relevant to Earth Materials and Practical Geochemistry and Data Analysis in later years.The final part (2weeks by Dr. Alex Thomas) looks at earth processes from an integrated point of view through a systematic study of biogeochemical cycles. The major biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus are discussed and compared and detailed interactive practical sessions are used to illustrate measurement, analysis and synthesis of biogeochemical data. Links between the physical climate system and biogeochemical cycles are introduced to show how human activity is impacting on the environment. On completion of this module, students will be able to use the terminology and appreciate the merits of the cyclical approach to biogeochemistry. They will be able to recall the principal components of each biogeochemical element and the processes operating within each reservoir. They will appreciate the differences between the biogeochemical elements and also the human impact on each cycle.Appropriate clothing for practicalsSome of the practicals in weeks 6-11 involve working with chemicals. For your own safety, and that of others, you must wear suitable clothing. Footwear must be closed toe (no sandals or flipflops). Clothing should cover exposed skin: shorts, skirts and kilts are not suitable. Long hair should be tied back. Scarfs and long neck ties must not be worn in the laboratory. If you insist on dressing up for class then a bow tie is acceptable. You are also expected to bring a lab notebook to the environmental chemistry practicals.",
    "course_description": "Part I Origin and Evolution of Life (Dr Stephen Brusatte, SB)Week 1 Building a Habitable Earth, Origin of Life & its ComplexityThis week we will cover the basics of Earth formation and structure, the age of the Earth, the origin of liquid water and the atmosphere, why Earth is an ideal setting for the evolution of life. We will ask: What is life?, what materials are necessary for life?, how did life form?. Topics will include prokaryotic vs. eukaryotic cells, direct and indirect evidence for the earliest life, the oldest fossils. We will examine the Proterozoic world, cyanobacteria and the oxygen revolution in EarthÂ¿s atmosphere, origin of eukaryotes, the first multicellular life, Snowball Earth and its effects on evolution, the Ediacaran faunaWeek 2 The Cambrian Explosion, origin of body plans, and evolutionary innovationThis week we will look at life in the Phanerozoic, the origin of skeletons, the Cambrian Explosion: what it was and what caused it, the phylogeny of animals, the Burgess Shale, how Cambrian environments affected early animals. You will learn the origin of the major animal body plans, Darwin and the theory of evolution, and how to read a cladogram. The outcomes of the Cambrian explosion are explored: first large predators, modern food webs, substrate revolution, trilobites and other important Cambrian groups, SepkoskiÂ¿s diversity curve and evolutionary faunas, introduction to mass extinctions.Week 3 Palaeozoic Ocean Evolution, and the invasion of the landHere we will investigate the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event and the Palaeozoic fauna, the end-Ordovician mass extinction, amazing Silurian fossil sites in England and Scotland, conodonts and the origin of bony vertebrates, the origin of fishes and the evolution of jaws. Topics will include the earliest forays onto land and the Rhynie Chert of Scotland, the first terrestrial ecosystems, the origin of tetrapods and the rise of vertebrate faunas on land, exciting new tetrapod research in Scotland, the origin of reptiles and amphibians, synapsid-dominated faunas during the Permian, the formation of Pangea and its effects on terrestrial evolution, the end-Permian and Triassic mass extinctions, the Triassic recovery and rise of archosaurs, the earliest dinosaurs and their competitors.Week 4 Dinosaurs, mammals, and Oceanic faunaThe last week of the Origin and Evolution of Life part of the course we will study the evolution of dinosaurs across their ~160-million-year evolutionary history, the major groups of dinosaurs and their salient features and behaviours, dinosaur evolution and palaeogeography, the origin of birds and invasion of the sky. The end-Cretaceous extinction and the death of the dinosaurs, the earliest mammals and their explosive radiation after the end-Cretaceous extinction, archaic mammals of the early Paleogene, and the origins of the modern mammal groups, later Cenozoic cooling and the spread of grasslands, the origin of humans will aslos be studied. The end-Permian extinction and rise of the Modern fauna, the Mesozoic Marine Revolution, Mesozoic microfossils and their importance in biostratigraphy, Mesozoic marine reptiles, the diversification of sharks and teleost fishes, whales take to the water. The Gaia hypothesis, an overview of how life has impacted Earth over the course of the last few billion years will also be introduced.Part II Global Climatic and Environmental Change (Dr Alex Thomas, ALT)Week 5 Energy model of Planet Earth, Plate Tectonics, Weathering and ClimateWe will start by building a simple climate model to understand the controls on the EarthÂ¿s surface temperature. We will then introduce the climate System; structure, composition and circulation of the atmosphere and of the ocean. We will look at evidence for past climatic change and use these changes to investigate different controls on Climate change over geological time. The climate driving processes include weathering of rocks as a possible thermostat for Global climate; the role of tectonic processes in driving past greenhouse and icehouse times in Earth history.Week 6 Mechanisms of medium and short term climate change, past and futureCooling from the Cretaceous into the modern icehouse; glacial-interglacial cycles of the past 2 million years and the role of orbital forcing will be introduced. Looking at shorter more recent climate change we will look at natural short-term variations in climate due to stochastic processes, variations in solar irradiance, effects of volcanic eruptions, effects of large meteorite impacts and auto-oscillations such as the El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation. Anthropogenic climate change and the role of greenhouse gases and aerosols will then be covered Including how we can identify the causes of current changes in the climate and how our climate is and will change into the futurePart III Environmental Geochemistry (Dr Geoff Bromiley GDB)Week 7 Atoms, Electrons, and ReactionsThe first week of the chemistry part of the course will cover: The atom and its constituent parts; the nucleus, protons (p) and neutrons (n). Atomic number). Atomic weights expressed as atomic mass units. What is the mass of an atomic particle? Gram formula weight; AvogadroÂ¿s number. Definition of element (same p), and isotope (same p, various n). Summary of elements listed by numbers of protons. Representation of elements by their symbol, with their atomic number and mass number. Electrons: their relative mass, how far away from the nucleus they are. Electron orbitals: K, L, M shells, orbital pairs, electronic configurations. Elements listed by electronic configuration, which dictates the key chemical properties we are often interested in: bonding, volatility, metal vs non-metal. Define and explain the key parts of the periodic table, via groups, and via split into metal/amphoteric/non-metal. Bonding of atoms: ionic, covalent, metallic, Van der Waals. Ionic compounds and molecules. What is a chemical reaction? How do they occur.

The state-steady geochemical cycle.Part IV Global Biogeochemical Cycles (Dr Alex Thomas, ALT)Week 9 Introduction to Biogeochemistry, and the carbon cycleHere we will define what biogeochemical elements are and how we ca simplify their study into cycles. The terminology and simple box models will be introduced starting with the carbon cycle. Forms of carbon, thier major reservoirs, atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and lithosphere, including fossil carbon burning will be investigated including ow carbon moves between these stocks. We will use some simple chemistry to understand the behaviour of carbon in these reservoirs and how this affects climate.Week 10 Nutrient cycle: Nitrogen and PhosphorousWe will look at the two biogeochemical cycles of two elements essential for life: nitrogen and phosphorous. We will identify the main chemical forms of these elements in the environment, the stocks in different environmental reservoirs and how these elements are moved between these reservoirs and their chemical form altered to affect their availability to be used by organisms. Biological transformations of nitrogen compounds; nitrogen fixation, ammonia, assimilation, nitrification, assimilatory nitrate fixation, ammonification and denitrification will be studied. Weathering of phosphorus minerals and flux of phosphorus to the rivers and oceans and the pH dependence on P bioavailability will be looked at.https://path.is.ed.ac.uk/courses/EASC08023_SV1_SEM1http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/current/dpt/cxeasc08023.htm",

It examines endogenic processes originating within the earth, exogenic processes occurring at the earth atmosphere ocean interface and the way they interact to create landforms.",
    "course_description": "The course will discuss the historical development and present use of major concepts in geomorphology such as uniformitarianism and catastrophism, magnitude and frequency of geomorphic events, ideas of landform equilibrium and evolution and the importance of temporal and spatial scales. We will then consider the nature of chemical and physical weathering and the concept of the Critical Zone. The course covers the properties and behaviour of materials and the forces acting on slopes, mass movements and case studies of slope instability.Hydrology is discussed through drainage basins, spatial and temporal variations in channel discharge, runoff generation, and the nature of open channel flow, fluvial erosion and sediment entrainment, fluvial sediment transport and deposition. We will also discuss drainage basin morphometry, the cross-sectional and plan form of river channels, depositional and erosional fluvial landforms and variations in fluvial activity. A consideration of river flooding rounds off this part of the course.On a larger scale, the course covers global morphology and its relationship to isostasy and tectonic processes. Isostasy will also be discussed as we consider the range of processes which create mountains and how the erosion of these mountains accelerates uplift.The morphology and behaviour of glaciers and ice sheets will then be studied, including the mechanisms and products of glacial formation, the concept of mass balance, the mechanisms of glacial flow, erosion and deposition; fluvioglacial erosion and deposition and the geomorphological landforms created.  We also explain how studying landforms helps us to understand past processes, reconstruct former glacial environments and also inform us of contemporary glacial systems.The course considers next rates of landscape change, both uplift and denudation, and will discuss the factors that control erosion and uplift and how these can be measured and dated.The course finishes with three interconnected lectures. Picking up themes discussed at the beginning of the course, we will discuss the evidence for megafloods and their importance on landscape evolution on Earth. Next, we will also discuss volcanic geomorphology and look at the range of landforms created by volcanic activity on Earth.  Finally, the course ends in a lecture where we demonstrate how knowledge of the geomorphology of the Earth to help understand the landscape features and processes found on Mars, where there is ample evidence of slope processes, rivers, glaciation, megafloods and volcanic activity.",

    "summary": "Human Geography is a broad course designed to introduce students to key geographical debates, theories and concepts. The course provides a foundation to future studies in geography. Students will gain a broad understanding of the interaction between human societies and the spaces in which they exist, looking at a range of economic, cultural, social, and political processes at a variety of scales. The course will explore four key themes: environment; colonial afterlives; bodies, identities and difference; people and mobility. Through these themes we will examine why geography matters to a series of contemporary debates and concerns, including: globalization, climate change, social inequality, capitalism, and the future. A variety of local, national and international case studies will be used to examine these substantive issues and to consider issues of social justice, values and ethics. During the course students will be encouraged to pursue their curiosity about the world around them and some of the most pressing, contemporary social, economic, political and cultural issues of our time.",
    "course_description": "The course is taught using lectures and tutorials and supported by a range of online materials. The lectures will introduce students to key geographical themes and ideas. The tutorials will enable students to explore these themes in a group setting in which they will be asked to draw upon their own observations, experience and readings. In Developing an Essay Plan students are expected to demonstrate how they will develop an essay on a pre-determined question. This plan will then be developed into a Degree Essay where students are expected to demonstrate a critical understanding of a key concept in human geography. Students will also be guided through a programme of directed reading that should feed into tutorials, essays and the take home examination.",

    "summary": "The restlessness of our planet is a consequence of the dynamic processes that operate over time both within it, on its surface and in its atmosphere. The dynamic character of the Earth System is not only responsible for our own existence, but also for inevitable natural hazards. This course will introduce the Earth System as a basis for characterising and understanding natural hazards, their causes and consequences. The major types of natural hazard will be described, analysed and assessed in terms of their underlying causes as well as their socio-economic and environmental impacts. This course capitalises on natural synergies between subsurface, surface and human dimensions of the Earth System. Hazards to be considered will include earthquakes and tsunamis, volcanic hazards (local, regional and global scale), meteorological hazards (hurricanes, tornados, dust storms, El Nino, flooding and coastal erosion), topographic hazards such as landslides, and hazards arising from climate change. The evidence for past natural catastrophes and hazards, recorded in natural archives, will be described along with remote sensing methods for documenting current hazards and hazard risk. The principles and application of risk assessment and analysis will be considered with respect to case studies. The Course comprises 20 lectures supplemented by a series of laboratory classes, together with a directed programme of reading. The Course is assessed by degree examination together with a series of practical exercises.",

    "summary": "Oceanography  is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to all branches of Oceanography, namely physical, biological, chemical and geological oceanography, for science students. While introducing the basic principles the course also aims to provide a solid foundation for marine aspects of advanced courses in environmental sciences, geography, sedimentology, marine geology, ecology and meteorology. The course is formally divided into physical, biological, chemical and geological oceanography but the multi-disciplinary nature of ocean sciences is emphasized through out the course by highlighting the links between disciplines.In this course you will find out about ocean currents, both wind-driven surface currents and deep ocean currents driven by the effects of temperature and dissolved salts on water buoyancy. The oceans play an important part transporting heat from low to high latitudes to maintain a balance in the global heat budget. The biological part reviews the different life forms found in the oceans, looking particularly at issues relating to biological productivity and biological diversity, adaptation of life forms and differences between various marine ecosystems. The chemical part will look at the properties of water, the chemical make up of salt, the distribution of dissolved gases and nutrients in the ocean which are vital for life, and the biological and physical factors that govern their occurrence. This set of lectures will also tackle how the ocean functions as a self-regulating system while highlighting the unique role the ocean plays in maintaining Earth's climate to be hospitable. Human impact on the marine environment is also discussed. The geological oceanography deals with the structure and the development of ocean basins, their bedrock geology and the influx of sediments. How ocean circulation and climate changes of the past are recorded in ocean sediments and mineral resources are also discussed.",

    "course_description": "The complex nature of the world's ecosystems arises from the inter-relationships between the physical environment, ecology and human intervention. The course structure reflects this interaction between soil, water and atmospheric processes within environmental systems. We begin with the inputs to the system of energy (radiation) and water (precipitation). Next the internal dynamics of the environmental system are examined (including topics of soil composition and properties, soil moisture and groundwater). Finally we cover the system outputs - water in gaseous and liquid form (as evaporation to the atmosphere and river runoff).The majority of the course focuses on developing a sound understanding of the physical and chemical processes that occur in the soil, atmosphere and freshwaters at the sub-regional scale. Case study lectures are interspersed amongst process-based lectures to demonstrate why an understanding of soil, water and atmospheric processes is required for effective environmental management.Through the course lectures, practicals and tutorials we will also begin to quantify soil, water and atmosphericprocesses as a basis for estimating environmental resources (such as water availability or nutrients for plant growth) and predicting the effects of environmental change. By the end of the course you will have an improved understanding of the world around you and will be better equipped to analyse environmental systems in a scientific manner.The course is relevant to all those with an interest in how environmental systems function: from whole organism biologists and ecologists to geologists and environmental chemists.",

    "course_description": "This course will help students to understand different and often competing explanations for the fundamental, underlying social cause(s) of environmental problems. We will focus on problem framings, including consideration of how environmental problems are defined, who is deemed responsible, and who should do what to solve the problem. This problem-solution coupling will help students to evaluate, adapt and justify different approaches to solving environmental problems. For example, some have argued for market-based solutions while others see capitalism as the root of environmental problems. Some believe private property is the problem, while others see it as the solution. Some advocate for individual consumption choices while others encourage developing environmental ethics. While some of these frames complement each other, others are contradictory: not all problem frames can be correct.  Each week students will read an overarching summary and examples of texts providing a different problem frame. These texts will include both environmental classics and contemporary news or policy documents that exemplify the frame. Students will work to understand the logic of the problem frame each week, as well as its assumptions, strengths and weaknesses.  Course structure: 1.

    "summary": "This course aims to assess relationships between volcanoes, the environment and people and to investigate how tephra (volcanic ash) layers can be used to study these interactions. Whilst tephra layers provide valuable information on volcanic activity and its impacts, they also offer a means of studying wider environmental change and the potential impacts of the environment on people and humans on the environment.  We will study volcanic eruptions, investigate how their direct and indirect effects can be used to exemplify extreme events, and how tephra layers can be used as chronological tools (through tephrochronology) to assess rates of change and their spatial patterns.  This requires a multidisciplinary approach and we will combine a number of disciplines ranging from geology, volcanology, glaciology, geomorphology, soil science, climatology, history and archaeology.",
    "course_description": "Volcanoes, Environment and People (VEP) begins by introducing volcanoes, eruptions, tephrochronology, geochemical analysis and dating techniques in the first four weeks. Firstly we will introduce the different types of volcanic activity and the implications for tephra production.  Next, several case studies are used to illustrate the environmental and cultural impacts of eruptions.  As the recent Icelandic examples demonstrated, even relatively small eruptions can have serious consequences for distant modern societies.  The principles and practice of tephrochronology will be introduced using mainly examples from the North Atlantic region.  This will include the important concepts of tephra isochrones, intervals of time and environmental tracers.  The teleconnections between tephra layers, ice cores, tree rings and ocean cores are also assessed.  It will be shown how tephrochronology can be used to record not only volcanic histories, but also establish, date and evaluate rates of environmental change and human-environment interactions.  Geochemical methods of characterising tephra layers will be considered next, and we will discuss how this can be used to identify sources, types of eruptions and correlate deposits. We will also have a hands-on session where we will demonstrate different types of tephra and allow you to see samples prepared for analysis. The dating of tephra layers is considered next and we will discuss the various methods of obtaining ages, including using historical information, ice core records, and radiometric dating.  There will also be an exercise in calibrating radiocarbon dates and the chronological interpretation of a complex tephra stratigraphy at an Icelandic archaeological site.The rest of the course builds on the introductory knowledge gained during the first four weeks to discuss in more detail the application of tephrochronology to volcanology, glaciology, archaeology, environmental studies and human-ecodynamics.  We will explore the interaction of volcanic activity and glaciers in Iceland, floods and the dispersion of tephra from eruptions in 1918, 1996, 2010 and 2011. We will also discuss how tephrochronology can help us to identify and date eruptions and floods from EyjafjallajÃ¶kull 6-7th and 10th centuries AD, as well as dating glacial geomorphological features and aiding our understanding of past climatic fluctuations. Before moving onto consider how tephrochronology can be applied to understand human-environment interactions, the extent of soil erosion in Iceland will be discussed and the reasons why Icelandic soils are so susceptible to being eroded. After introduction the Norse colonisation and settlement of the North Atlantic region and Iceland in particular, the next three lectures will discuss how tephrochronology can be applied to studying cultural and environmental change through chronology and landscape reconstruction.  Iceland provides a superb natural laboratory to study these interactions between the environment and people.  Precisely dated tephra layers also enable the rates of change to be calculated, which elsewhere is very difficult to measure.  We are able to explore notions of changing resilience, threshold crossing events, catastrophe cusps and early warning signals.The course finishes with a fieldtrip to East Lothian, which provides an opportunity to study exposures of Carboniferous age tephra layers and apply knowledge gained in the course.",

This course will provide students with an opportunity to explore a range of alternate approaches, examine the nature of the evidence or output from these approaches, and integrate the different information sources together.The course starts with an introduction to the nature and importance of interdisciplinarity, and an exploration of the application to Â¿wicked problemsÂ¿. There are a series of sessions introducing students to different types of thinking, including critical (convergent) thinking, creative (divergent) thinking, and systems thinking.  There are also a number of sessions focusing on the perspectives and tools of different disciplines in relation to the environment, from art and psychology to economics and philosophy. Most of these sessions involve an expert guest speaker sharing their learning.Each session involves diverse pre-learning from listening to music to analysing papers, which will form the basis of plenary discussions. Each session also ends with group work, including debates, workshops and systems mapping. Throughout, students will consider the interconnections and differences between disciplines, the nature of thinking and evidence involved in different disciplines, and how these can be synthesised to provide solutions to complex environmental issues.An example course timetable is (please note this may vary year to year):-\tWhy interdisciplinary matters-\tA psychological approach to the environment-\tA philosophical approach to the environment-\tCreative thinking workshop-\tAn artistic approach to the environment-\tA legal approach to the environment-\tCritical thinking workshop-\tAn economic approach to the environment-\tA political approach to the environment-\tSystems thinking workshop",

The critical approaches applied in this course stem from ideas within cultural, political and social geographies which centralise the role of power in socio-spatial dynamics, and how power produces complex relations between society and the landscapes we inhabit. Critical approaches in human geography provide a framework to understand society and landscapes as carrying multiple meanings. We examine society as composed of knowledge, institutions, community dynamics, representations, discourses, inclusions/exclusions, material aspects, and more. Similarly, landscapes are explored in terms of nature, bodies, the imagination, digital realms, technology, everyday experiences, and other dimensions. These various perspectives demonstrate how power imbues landscapes and society with various meanings, and how ideas in human geography can critically analyse the co-production and experiences of landscapes, power and society.",

It explores the development of capitalism and the nation-state, and it explores the relationships between industrialisation, imperialism and the emergence of a world economy, with a particular focus on changing geographies of labour. It also focuses on the rise and fall of communism in several societies.  There is also an emphasis on recent economic and political ideologies such as neoliberalism, as well as current issues including global consumption, waste, debt and financial crisis.

It examines endogenic processes originating within the earth, exogenic processes occurring at the earth atmosphere ocean interface and the way they interact to create landforms.",
    "course_description": "The course will discuss the historical development and present use of major concepts in geomorphology such as uniformitarianism and catastrophism, magnitude and frequency of geomorphic events, ideas of landform equilibrium and evolution and the importance of temporal and spatial scales. We will then consider the nature of chemical and physical weathering and the concept of the Critical Zone. The course covers the properties and behaviour of materials and the forces acting on slopes, mass movements and case studies of slope instability.Hydrology is discussed through drainage basins, spatial and temporal variations in channel discharge, runoff generation, and the nature of open channel flow, fluvial erosion and sediment entrainment, fluvial sediment transport and deposition. We will also discuss drainage basin morphometry, the cross-sectional and plan form of river channels, depositional and erosional fluvial landforms and variations in fluvial activity. A consideration of river flooding rounds off this part of the course.On a larger scale, the course covers global morphology and its relationship to isostasy and tectonic processes. Isostasy will also be discussed as we consider the range of processes which create mountains and how the erosion of these mountains accelerates uplift.The morphology and behaviour of glaciers and ice sheets will then be studied, including the mechanisms and products of glacial formation, the concept of mass balance, the mechanisms of glacial flow, erosion and deposition; fluvioglacial erosion and deposition and the geomorphological landforms created.  We also explain how studying landforms helps us to understand past processes, reconstruct former glacial environments and also inform us of contemporary glacial systems.The course considers next rates of landscape change, both uplift and denudation, and will discuss the factors that control erosion and uplift and how these can be measured and dated.The course finishes with three interconnected lectures. Picking up themes discussed at the beginning of the course, we will discuss the evidence for megafloods and their importance on landscape evolution on Earth. Next, we will also discuss volcanic geomorphology and look at the range of landforms created by volcanic activity on Earth.  Finally, the course ends in a lecture where we demonstrate how knowledge of the geomorphology of the Earth to help understand the landscape features and processes found on Mars, where there is ample evidence of slope processes, rivers, glaciation, megafloods and volcanic activity.",

Students will gain a broad understanding of the interaction between human societies and the spaces in which they exist, looking at a range of economic, cultural, social, and political processes at a variety of scales. The course will explore four key themes: environment; colonial afterlives; bodies, identities and difference; people and mobility. Through these themes we will examine why geography matters to a series of contemporary debates and concerns, including: globalization, climate change, social inequality, capitalism, and the future. A variety of local, national and international case studies will be used to examine these substantive issues and to consider issues of social justice, values and ethics.

This field and practical-based course will allow students to formulate research questions and hypotheses and then test them with observations and appropriate data analysis. Students will also learn how to plan a small group research project and work in small groups in the field, or with secondary data (including field or remote sensed data). These groups will work together to analyse data and present their results to their peers. A series of practical classes will further develop their analytical and visualisation skills and also be used to create a group ArcGIS Story Map (to a lay audience). Students will also write an individual detailed research paper on their findings. Use will also be made of high quality secondary data sources to provide data where field work is not possible or appropriate.",
    "course_description": "The overall aim of this course is to build on the first year Physical Geography and Fundamental Methods in Geography courses, further develop knowledge from these courses and introduce BSc students to new skills needed to undertake field-based research. This course is based in Edinburgh (as last year), and will introduce the students to a wide range of field techniques, which will enable you to tackle relevant and topical geomorphological, fluvial and biogeographical related research questions. A number of local field excursions are planned, which will be complimented with virtual field visits and the use of secondary datasets, where necessary. A number of complementary surveying, GIS, remote sensing and statistical techniques will also be introduced. Introductory local field visits are planned to local Edinburgh sites to cover geomorphological mapping, fluvial hydrology and biogeography. These will followed by practical sessions (either in person or online), which will further develop skills in statistics, GIS, remote sensing and visualisation of data. This course complements the Global Change and Geomorphology courses and will result in a high level of methodological awareness, which will be built upon by Environmental Geography in Semester 2. The overall aim of this course is to build on the first year Physical Geography and Fundamental Methods in Geography courses, and introduce further develop knowledge from these courses and introduce the BSc students to a  range ofnew skills needed to undertake field-based research. The core of this course is a week-long residential fieldtrip to Snowdonia, where students will be introduced to a range of field techniques to enable then to study geomorphological, fluvial and biogeographical issues. The first two days of the fieldtrip will consist of learning new field techniques, and reacquainting themselves with those covered briefly in the previous year's Fundamental Methods weekend fieldtrip. These will cover geomorphological mapping of mainly erosional glacial landforms and ice stream sediments, learning how to gauge a river and establish its water quality, as well as forestry and moorland biogeographical sampling techniques. This course is based in Edinburgh (this year), but still intends to introduce the students to a wide range of field techniques, which will enable them to research relevant and topical geomorphological, fluvial and biogeographical issues. A number of local field excursions are planned, which will be complimented with virtual field visits and the use of secondary datasets, where necessary. A number of complementary surveying, GIS, remote sensing and statistical techniques will also be introduced. After a day planning their projects and carrying out class based work, the students will undertake a two research project, before presenting their results at an end of trip conferenceIntroductory local field visits are planned to local Edinburgh sites to cover geomorphological mapping, fluvial hydrology and biogeography. On returning to Edinburgh, students will undertake four weeksThese will followed by of practical sessions (either in person or online), which will include further development of their skills in statistics, GIS, remote sensing and visualisation of data.

Each topic will be a major idea or public issue, and will be explored through an introductory lecture and related readings, and correspond with one day of dedicated fieldwork visiting sites that pertain to that topic. Students will be asked to consider an understanding of the difference between how a topic could be approached through the physical sciences, social sciences and humanities.Year to year, the structure of the course will remain the same, but the themes will change. Introductory lectures will provide 5 weeks of lectures preceding the trip and will include:- An introduction to fieldwork in geography.- An introduction to the histories and geographies of the locality.- Introductions to the key themes.Indicative Topics Include:- Future Natures: rewilding and the carbon economy.- Energy Futures: the changing social relations of peat, coal, oil and wind,- Community Futures: the struggle for land, from the Clearances to community ownership.- The Future of Memory: negotiating the cultural past from statues to place names.- Future Borders: UK borders are contested and undergoing change.Teaching will consist of a combination of lectures, small group project learning and field work. The field trips are designed to gain first-hand experience of the issues covered, and to develop the skills of observation as a prelude to interpretation and analysis.",

The course is delivered through both lectures and practicals, in which the practical sessions will build on the material introduced in lecture and provide opportunities to apply these new methods to real examples.",
    "course_description": "This course provides an introduction to the use of qualitative and quantitative methodologies in geography. The course work is designed to give students experience in using methods to collect and analyse real world data and, thereby, to gain insights into the characteristics of the techniques and their overall value, merits and limitations as a means of investigation. It establishes the value and importance of a core set of methodologies, and the means by which data is generated, analysed and presented. The course covers the process through which appropriate research methods are selected, and will introduce the use of participant-observation, secondary data (i.e. documents), social media, correlation and regression, probability, significance and hypothesis testing, and nonparametric statistics (such as logistic regression). The course also considers rigour in research, validation and reliability of findings, and research ethics.The output of the course is two pieces of coursework that will develop skills in collecting, analysing and presenting qualitative and quantitative data. The first piece of coursework is a 2500 word project report (worth 50%, due in Week 6) which will assess your ability to accomplish key aspects of your selected qualitative method, focusing on introducing a project, drawing on relevant thematic and methods literature, collecting data, analysing data and presenting data using the selected method. The second is an assignment (worth 50%, due in Week 11) with a combination of numerical answers and short-form (non-essay) answers testing interpretation of statistical evidence. Students will work with similar but unique data sets, so each student will be required to use their own data to complete the assessment.",

Students will be exposed to common geospatial datasets, how they are derived, where they can be found, and methods for fusing them with other physical and human geography datasets to inform decisions. The students will be trained in data analysis using Python and GIS through a series of taught practicals and two assessed coursework projects. Emphasis will be placed on transferable skills and on identifying the most appropriate technique for a given scientific analysis or inquiry.",
    "course_description": "The overall aim of the course is to show how geoscientists can use data to guide decision making. The course will provide students competency in visualising and statistically analysing large data sets from a range of subdisciplines across physical geography, and in a range of data formats commonly used in geoscientific data analysis (e.g., geotiff and NetCDF). Methods taught will centre around 2 commonly-used data analysis tools: GIS software, and the Python programming language. Through this lens the students will be taught basic statistical and numerical analysis techniques (e.g. correlation, regression and statistical significance), and sequential and spatial analysis techniques (e.g. interpolation, mosaicking and smoothing). The course will be delivered as a series of practicals, devised to take the students through the core skills and concepts while at the same time engaging them with analysis of real geographical data drawn from freely available sources. Demonstrators will provide support but course staff will play a proactive role via demonstrations and discussion.Emphasis throughout the course will be in delivering key academic and transferrable skills training which students can tailor to an area of geography of their choice, and which will act as crucial preparation for undertaking independent research in Years 3 to 4 of a Geography degree. Additionally, emphasis will be placed on identifying the most appropriate computational/analysis technique for a given scientific investigation. For instance, regression may be more easily carried out in Python but GIS may be simpler for data pre-processing and preparation.Outline Syllabus:Weeks 1-4: Weekly 3-hour labs in GIS and remote sensing (EO)Weeks 5-10: Weekly 3-hour labs in Python (Assessment 1 in week 6)Week 11: Python, leveraging GIS, with optional 3 hour python surgeryDetailed Syllabus:GIS and Remote Sensing:Week 1: Intro to geospatial analysis and remote sensing: Common forms of geospatial data (raster, vector and shapefile), what does a satellite measure and how to extract information from it.Week 2: Mapping land surface properties with GIS and remote sensing for decision making.Week 3: Accuracy assessments.

Complementary surveying, GIS, remote sensing and statistical techniques will be introduced in lectures and practicals leading up to the trip. Lectures will also introduce the basics of tectonic geomorphology.Formative assessment during this stage of the course will consist of a poster prior to leaving for the field that presents the results of analyses using GIS and remote sensing to quantify the topographic characteristics of an actively uplifting landscape. This exercise will prepare students for the assessed components of the course by offering an introduction to the study area and techniques, as well as training in data analysis in poster design.The classroom component will be followed by a week-long residential fieldtrip to Southern Spain, where students will be introduced to a range of field techniques to enable them to study geomorphological, fluvia,l and biogeographical issues. The first two days of the fieldtrip will consist of an overview of the landscape including the tectonic context, and an introduction to some sedimentary deposits to understand how the landscape has changed through time. The third day will cover the biogeography of the study region. The remainder of the trip will be devoted to an independent research project that will culminate in an assessed research poster. Formative feedback will be given throughout.",

The course will conceptually introduce students to Black Geographies, beginning from the global production of Blackness and Edinburgh's Black history, and then focus on key themes such as racial capitalism, Black ecologies, Black feminist embodiment, spatial poetics, abolition and repair, and Black practicing of plotting and commoning (marronage, etc.). To interrogate these topics in ways that attend to Black ways of knowing, the course will include text-based, visual, sound materials, and artistsÂ¿ works, draws on experiential practices, and includes a walking tour.Within this course, students will develop their own critical-creative practice at a selected Edinburgh site/display, to deploy Black Geographies approaches that presence Black history and Black life and demonstrate a reflection on their own positionality.The course will consist of weekly two-hour sessions of lecture and seminar, as well as tutorial sessions for students across the semester, and a two-hour external visit (walking tour). The seminars, tutorials and an external visit will reinforce content introduced in the lectures and offer hands-on experience for students to engage with the city of Edinburgh.",
    "course_description": "This course provides a grounded introduction to key concepts and themes in Black Geographies. Black Geographies encompasses the ways that we understand the interdisciplinary nature of Black life through geographic frames, as well as refers to the expansion of geographic knowledge that takes place when we intentionally centre Black experiences, questions, and ways of knowing. This course draws on the myriad ways that Black life has been historically shaped and takes place in African and African diaspora contexts. The course interrogates the racial production of Blackness through the interrelated global projects of enslavement and colonisation, as well as attends to the continued creative, interdisciplinary production of Black life by peoples and in contexts racialised as Black.Recognising the City of Edinburgh's deep connections to enslavement and colonisation, the course engages Edinburgh as a situated location from which to learn, develop and apply Black geographic critiques. Students will critically interrogate and presence enslavement and colonial histories, and use Black spatial and social justice critiques, creative practices and interventions.The course proceeds in two parts:Part 1 will conceptually orient students to the production of Blackness and Black Geographies as a situated and critical approach. Lectures will provide an overview of key topic and ideas, seminars will operate as 'reading groups' where students bring their questions, reflections and responses to materials. Tutorial sessions will include, for example, a positionality reflection and workshop and walking tour of Edinburgh's Black History. These sessions will enable students to think about how we can approach Black Geographies from our different racialised positions, situate the course's Black Geographic focus within Edinburgh, and students will select one Edinburgh site or display (for example, a building, street, monument, etc.) for their focus within the course. The students will maintain the same one site over the course of the semester.Part 2 will cover selected topics in Black Geographies, students will apply their learnings to their selected site, and they will be supported to develop their own original critical-creative practices, which are grounded in a Black methodology, in their selected site. In seminar sessions, students will be supported to develop their understandings of each topic. Tutorial sessions will be designed around practical tasks to directly guide and support students progress and preparation. They will be supported to develop their understandings of each topic, and they will have the opportunity to apply their understandings to their selected Edinburgh sites (through tasks such as writing fieldnotes at their site, online research on their site's history, analysing examples of site-specific practices, experimenting and testing out selected spatial practices, etc.).The emphasis on students maintaining the same site is a pedagogical approach that directs them to develop a deep familiarity with their site through extended engagement and opportunity to use the site to work through course concepts, which will inform their site-specific practice. The students' work will be to presence the Black history of the site and then developing a critical-creative, site-specific practice in the site.An indicative structure:PART ONE: CONCEPTUAL ORIENTATIONSWeek 1: Course overview, learning outcomes, assessments and introduction: 'What is Black Geographies?'Week 2: The global production of BlacknessWeek 3: Walking tour to situate Edinburgh's Black histories and presentPART TWO: SELECTED TOPICS & DEVELOPMENT OF SITE-SPECIFIC PRACTICEWeek 4: Methodologies for Black lifeWeek 5: Racial capitalism[Reading Week, no class]Week 6: Black geologies and ecologiesWeek 7: Black feminisms and embodimentWeek 8: Black spatial poeticsWeek 9: Abolition and repairWeek 10: Marronage, and plotting Black commons",

These conceptual concerns then form the basis for examining a series of important issues facing contemporary cities that include: how we live with difference in cities; how water infrastructures produce inequality; how walls freeze conflict into urban landscapes; how we deal with ghosts and social injustice through urban memory-work; and how urban ruins offer particular insights into the post-industrial city.Course syllabusWeek 1: The everyday cityWeek 2: Urban MaterialitiesWeek 3: Urban AffectsWeek 4: Fieldwork and zine workshopWeek 5: Zine WorkshopWeek 6: Urban Multiculture: BradfordWeek 7: Hydraulic Cities: MumbaiWeek 8: City of Walls: Sao Paulo and BaghdadWeek 9: Haunted Cities: BerlinWeek 10: Urban Ruins: DetroitWeek 11 Essay WorkshopThe course is open to 3rd and 4th undergraduate students as well as PGT GeoSciences students.

This course will develop students critical thinking about the environment as a site of political contestation.The introductory (5 week) section of the course will examine the growth of the environmental justice (EJ) movement from its origins in the United States, and the broadening out of this movement to different scales and geographies. It will introduce key concepts from the work of Rawls (1972), Sen (2009), Nussbaum (2000), and highlight in particular Schlosberg's (2004; 2007) trivalent conception of EJ, incorporating distribution, participation and recognition. These dimensions and the interplay between them will form a continual theme throughout the course.This introductory part will also consider different disciplinary perspectives on EJ (for instance from Geography and Ecological Economics), and intersections between EJ and environmental ethics. The course then develops to set up a framework of local and global EJ issues, discussing key concepts for these different scales of analysis. With these conceptual foundations, the course then moves forward to consider a number of cases in which EJ claims are made, from the local scale to the global.Students are able to apply the conceptual lenses developed in the introductory section to these cases. Where the cases draw on primary research, students will be encouraged to think about appropriate research methodologies for investigating EJ.This course will develop students' critical thinking about the environment as a site of political contestation. Furthermore, it will challenge students to think about the complicity of all of us in matters of environmental justice.",

    "summary": "This course aims to provide students with a detailed, integrated knowledge of the physics and dynamics of erosion and landscape evolution in non-glaciated landscapes. Hills and mountains are continuously being denuded and dissected by erosional processes. In non-glaciated landscapes sediment is produced on hillslopes, delivered to channels, and eventually transported to basins.",
    "course_description": "In this course, students will be introduced to the processes that sculpt these upland regions. The processes and their feedbacks will be analysed at different scales, from particles to mountain ranges and from single transport events (e.g. landslide, flood) to geological time scales. Theoretical, experimental (analogical and numerical) and field studies constitute the basis of this course. Lectures, group work and practicals including numerical modelling exercises will allow students to understand and quantify hillslope and fluvial processes and to gain knowledge on the interactions between these processes and on their relative importance in driving landscape evolution.",

Examples will range from the movement of the human body through various technologies of everyday mobility such as the car and the train to the contemporary concern with transitions to low carbon futures. The dialectic relationship between society and space expressed in the idea of 'spatiality' will be central to the course. We will see how spaces and mobilities of one kind or another are created in order to produce power and particular kinds of relations between social groups. Examples include the politics of walking, the role of the railroad in the creation of American mythology, the threat of the tramp and vagabond and the significance of airport terminals to postmodern theory. In addition to an examination of power we will also look at the way space and mobility comes into play in the transformation of power through innovative forms of resistance such as dancing, joyriding, train-jumping. through these explorations we will focus on a range of historically marginalized groups including children, poor people, LGBTQ people, disabled people and ethnic and racial minorities. Students will come away from the course with the theoretical tools necessary to understand the variety of relations between mobility and power and a firm knowledge of the way this works on the ground.The course is open to 3rd and 4th undergraduate students as well as PGT GeoSciences students.

This course is an introduction to theories and analyses of race and racism in human geography. It will provide you with knowledge and skills to observe and analyse how race works in society and how it impacts our everyday lives.

    "course_description": "This course offers an introduction to theorisations and empirical analyses of race and racism in human geography. The course is divided in three parts. The course will start with an introduction to race as a social construct and an exploration of theorisations of race in the social sciences (Part 1, - Theorising and contextualising race, racialisation and racismÂ¿). We will discuss the origins of racial categories and we will trace their histories across different geographical contexts. We will observe the contestations of these categories from a variety of academic and activist perspectives, with a specific focus on intersectional critiques by Black feminist scholars and activists. In Part 2, - Spatialising race: Critical geographies of race and racialisation. we will discuss the specific contribution of anti-racist critiques to the discipline of geography. Our exploration will focus on three specific directions of geographical enquiry: Black geographies, geographies of whiteness and geographies of Islamophobia. The final section of the course, Part 3 - Navigating and Contesting Racialisations and Racisms, will focus on contemporary examples of empirical geographical research.In this course, we will discuss both academic literature and a variety of cultural texts that present current understandings of race and racism (poems, songs, videos, movies, photographs, social media material). The resources provided in the course will include perspectives from non-English-speaking contexts, in order to problematise the centrality of the English language in the production of discourses about race (and against racism).

    "summary": "Borders are instrumental to our daily lives: they connect, divide, reorient, prohibit and facilitate relations in society, in politics, and in the economy. They are often associated with violence and instability (as on the US-Mexico border), and remain at the heart of many of our contemporary debates (including Brexit). This course will provide an introduction to some of the ways that geographers and other scholars have conceptualised borders, and will equip students with the analytical and theoretical tools to identify and critique the many ways that borders shape the world around them.",
    "course_description": "In the past 30 years, the discipline of 'border studies' has developed partly in response to growing concerns around the role of borders and boundaries in fostering instability, conflict and human rights abuses. Intractable border conflicts stemming from decolonization processes, from post WWII reorganisation, from settler colonial expansionist agendas, and from internal civil conflict contribute to the need for scholars to explore, theorise and address the histories, politics and economics of borders and boundaries in the contemporary world.Borders take many forms, and exist across many scales. The most obvious type is the international border that defines the territory of one nation-state from another. Administrative borders that identify units within nation-states are also well understood. Yet borders exist beyond the confines of the political map, through what many scholars call 'border technologies' and 'border regimes'. Borders exist at the airport and at ferry ports, in law offices, courts of law, hospitals, schools, and other government facilities. They are enacted through increasingly systematised and digitized mechanisms, and include the use of biometric data, personal histories of health and mobility, economic means testing, and forms of social difference. Geographers like Louise Amoore, Reece Jones and Corey Johnson, and David Newman have written about the multiple technologies that are mobilised and triangulated for such purposes.Borders are often on the front page of the news media, sitting at the heart of issues around forced migration and asylum law, conflict and warfare, economic development, and nationalist political agendas. Some scholars, like Wendy Brown, Michael Dear, and Eyal Weizman, examine the physicality and architecture of bordering walls, while other, like Matthew Sparke, focus on the legal frameworks that allow some migrants through borders and prohibit others from crossing.This course will provide students with an introduction to the issues, debates, literature and theoretical underpinnings of the field of Border Studies. It will do so through a two-pronged approach: empirical case studies will be examined with reference to 1) key readings in critical theory and 2) an appropriate methodological approach.This course is open to 3rd and 4th year Geography and Geography pathway students.",

They will also learn to source and use a variety of materials- scholarly literature, photographs, documentaries and films, fiction, media articles- for the investigation of the complexities of understanding, maintaining, and challenging border regimes. Transferable skills gained will include that of working in groups, creative and critical reading, including working with long monographs and written documents, effective writing to short deadlines, and synthesising a variety of disparate materials for a wider audience.",

The course will provide a conceptual 'spine' to students' Year 4 studies and progression from the core Year 3 course 'Nature of Geographical Knowledge'. It is seen as essential that students, in the final year of their own development as geographers, are made aware of geography's making and reception as a form of knowledge, of contemporary 'big'. The course will draw upon the philosophy of social constructivism as a principal analytic frame.This is an ideas-based core course in undergraduate geography, designed to provide insight into the social and political making of geography as a form of knowledge and to alert students to the conceptual models available for the interpretation, inter alia, of the categories 'Geography', 'Science', 'Policy', 'Politics of Knowledge', and 'Public'. The course will build upon students' exposure to conceptual ideas and to epistemological questions in Year 3 of the Geography Honours Programme (Nature of Geographical Knowledge) and allow them, in Year 4, to ally their own experiences as advanced undergraduates with the issues raised in the course.",

    "course_description": "This course is based in Iceland because it is one of the finest areas of the world for the study of geomorphological processes, and landforms shaped by volcanism, past and present glaciation, rivers, catastrophic floods, and human impacts. Uniquely within the Old World the timing and cultural context of the first human settlement, by the Norse in the ninth century AD, is known in detail, and can be dated in the field by reference to a clearly developed layer of volcanic ash (tephra) deposited at the same time. Iceland was one of the last new places on Earth settled by people, yet human impacts exacerbated by climate change have stripped the land of about 20,000Km2 of soil cover- it is the most eroded country in Europe.Iceland has the best-developed tephrochronology in the world, and this powerful dating technique offers a remarkable aid to understanding Earth surface processes, environmental change and human-environment interactions in the fieldwork. Virtually every type of volcanic activity on Earth takes place in Iceland. The island occupies a strategic location close to the atmospheric and oceanic Polar Fronts, and so it is a globally significant place for the study of climate change and glacier fluctuations. Icelandic case studies have wide significance because landscape processes active in Iceland today shaped large areas of the Northern Hemisphere during the Quaternary glaciations. In addition the characteristics of the island's biota provide fundamental tests for theories of island biogeography and glacial refugia that in turn are important to the understanding of evolution and continental scale biogeographical patterns.To give context to your case studies of environmental change, historical, cultural and economic aspects of Icelandic society are also discussed because these human dimensions are vital to the wider understanding of drivers of change over the last millennium, and offers unique insights into the interplay of culture and environment in marginal areas.There are three pre- excursion lunchtime meetings in late March (S2 week 10) and attendance is compulsory.Ten days are spent in Iceland in early September, five of which are devoted to your small group project work. A series of structured activities are used to add deep context to the project work; these structured activities include hikes on mountain trails and through gorges, work on a glacier, and a visit to the off shore island of Vestamannaeyjar where we climb the crater formed by an eruption in 1973. Ground transportation will be in Land Rovers and a significant time will be spent travelling on gravel roads. Our accommodation at an isolated community centre is very simple, living is communal and we self-cater.",

There will be initial classroom-based lectures introducing key themes and considering the development of Scottish upland environments through the Holocene, human dimensions of change and research design. This will be followed by a field-based introduction to the research projects followed by structured discussions and group working leading to research projects conducted over three further field days and student-lead seminars. Assessment will be in the form of a field notebook and a research report.Preparation for the field-based research will take place during the first field excursion, and this will involve an overnight stay at a hostel in Braemar.  Themes of Late Quaternary landscape evolution, geomorphological and ecological change, and cultural development and land use will be introduced.  Student projects (working in groups of no more than three, but producing individual research reports) will be developed during a subsequent four day excursion also based at Braemar.",

    "course_description": "Principles covered include co-ordinate reference systems, map projections and the different models that GIS employ to represent real-world entities through the use of both vector and raster modelling. Also considered are the effects that these models and the analytical functionality of systems have on the type of information produced. Vector and raster data models are explained and there is an introduction to representing and analysing 3D, terrain based data. Various case studies are used to highlight various types of analysis typically performed using GIS. Basic elements of graphic design and communication are reviewed to ensure that output from GIS is comprehensible and effective. The course examines the importance of data quality in spatial decision making. The lectures are complimented by a series of computer based practicals in which a series of hands on exercises enable students to gain first hand practical knowledge of how to use a GIS.No prior knowledge of GIS is expected or required for this course though it is expected that you have good levels of numeracy and a logical mind. A familiarity with spreadsheets or basic programming skills will prove useful but is not mandatory. Engagement with the course text will be essential: Heywood DI, Cornelius S, Carver S 2011. An introduction to geographical information systems 4th ed (ebook or softback).Fieldwork associated with the MSc in GIS means there is no teaching in Week 6.

In this course, we will step back from these assumptions to critically examine different explanations for the fundamental, underlying social cause(s) of environmental problems.

    "course_description": "This course will help students to understand different and often competing explanations for the fundamental, underlying social cause(s) of environmental problems. We will focus on problem framings, including consideration of how environmental problems are defined, who is deemed responsible, and who should do what to solve the problem. This problem-solution coupling will help students to evaluate, adapt and justify different approaches to solving environmental problems. For example, some have argued for market-based solutions while others see capitalism as the root of environmental problems. Some believe private property is the problem, while others see it as the solution. Some advocate for individual consumption choices while others encourage developing environmental ethics. While some of these frames complement each other, others are contradictory: not all problem frames can be correct.  Each week students will read an overarching summary and examples of texts providing a different problem frame. These texts will include both environmental classics and contemporary news or policy documents that exemplify the frame. Students will work to understand the logic of the problem frame each week, as well as its assumptions, strengths and weaknesses.  Course structure: 1. Social Explanations for Environmental Problems 2. The Sky is Falling! Technology is Causing the End of Humanity! 3. In Defense of Modernity: Science, Technology and Innovation will Save Us! 4. The Tragedy of the Commons: Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all! 5. The (Regulated) Commons is the Solution! 6. Bring on the Leviathan! (Big) Government as the Solution 7.

As an honours course we will be drawing on theory-driven and empirical texts, and your success will be determined by your willingness to critically engage with your readings and synthesize theoretical debates. We will build from the idea of queerness as messy, \"creating disorder and disruptive commotion within the normative arrangements of bodies, things, spaces and institutions\" (Manalansan, 2015: 567). Our studies will focus on the uneven landscapes of sexuality and gender and the power dynamics that unfold in the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, Two-Spirit, and more (LGBTQ2+) spaces and processes of placemaking. Utilising queer, trans, and feminist approaches to studying human geography, we will consider how race, colonialism, geopolitics, and class intersect with spatialised forms of sexuality and gender, LGBTQ2+ politics and cultures, and what this reveals about the everyday landscapes we inhabit.This course is open to 3rd and 4th year students.

Although the central concepts for this course are geographical (space, scale, place), we will read academic material from other disciplines too, as geographers have long engaged in wider theoretical frameworks and ideas coming from the social sciences, humanities and religious studies. Students will be equipped to explore the ways in which religion becomes part of the everyday in material ways and at the same time is contested symbolically, as individuals and groups struggle over meanings. The academic readings will be supplemented by multi-modal materials, including short documentaries, music videos, photographic essays, podcasts and other forms of knowledge and knowledge-production informed by the weekly topics. In this way, the course will prepare students to understand and be critical about a wide range of, not only ideas, but also methods of representation. Teaching and learning will be done through lectures, discussion seminars and two forms of assessment. Lectures will focus on key themes in the study of religion. Students are expected to do two key readings per lecture and make use of the multi-modal resources that are suggested. During discussion seminars, there will be an opportunity for students to ask, comment and critique ideas. Themes introduced in weekly lectures will include: geographical approaches to religion; secularism; colonialism; race; economics; gender; queer spiritualities; radicalism/extremism; activism; and eco-theologies.",

    "summary": "It has long been recognised that human experience and knowledge are mediated through the senses. The senses- sight, touch, taste, hearing and smell - play a vital role in shaping the way we interact with, and attune ourselves to, the world around us. This course will focus on understanding these everyday sensory worlds and their variation across various historical and geographical contexts. In so doing, it acknowledges that sensory perception is as much a social, cultural and political practice as it is a physical or biological function. The course will begin by examining the philosophical groundings of the scholarly study of the senses within geography and related disciplines, before moving on to look at the work of contemporary theorists on a range of topics such as silence and noise, darkness and light, pleasure and disgust, immersion and distance, atmosphere and affect. Whilst the structure of the course will be largely dictated by the traditional Western classification of the five senses, ample consideration will be given to other sensory modalities such as kinesthesia (the sensation of movement) and synaesthesia (subjective sensation).",
    "course_description": "The lecture topics will include taste, touch, smell, hearing, vision, kinesthesia and synaesthesia, sensory methods, senses and the city, and environmental sensitivities. The course will be organised around lectures (with some guest speakers), student-led discussions, and tutorials, and will attempt to be as sensorially engaging as possible in its pedagogy, providing numerous opportunities for students to physically explore their senses. Experiential learning is a key component of the course and students will be invited to develop their own sensory dexterities by conducting mini-investigations on and through the senses.Course Aims:1. To introduce the students to the broad range of scholarship on the senses currently circulating within geography and related disciplines.2. To illustrate the ways in which our understandings of distinct sensory perceptions are historically, culturally and geographically situated.3. To consider the methodological implications of geographers theorization of the senses and the challenge that new and emerging approaches present to older paradigms.4. To encourage students to reflect upon their own sensory engagements and make connections between knowledge gained in class and the wider world.",

    "summary": "This course aims to assess relationships between volcanoes, the environment and people and to investigate how tephra (volcanic ash) layers can be used to study these interactions. Whilst tephra layers provide valuable information on volcanic activity and its impacts, they also offer a means of studying wider environmental change and the potential impacts of the environment on people and humans on the environment.  We will study volcanic eruptions, investigate how their direct and indirect effects can be used to exemplify extreme events, and how tephra layers can be used as chronological tools (through tephrochronology) to assess rates of change and their spatial patterns.  This requires a multidisciplinary approach and we will combine a number of disciplines ranging from geology, volcanology, glaciology, geomorphology, soil science, climatology, history and archaeology.",
    "course_description": "Volcanoes, Environment and People (VEP) begins by introducing volcanoes, eruptions, tephrochronology, geochemical analysis and dating techniques in the first four weeks. Firstly we will introduce the different types of volcanic activity and the implications for tephra production.  Next, several case studies are used to illustrate the environmental and cultural impacts of eruptions.  As the recent Icelandic examples demonstrated, even relatively small eruptions can have serious consequences for distant modern societies.  The principles and practice of tephrochronology will be introduced using mainly examples from the North Atlantic region.  This will include the important concepts of tephra isochrones, intervals of time and environmental tracers.  The teleconnections between tephra layers, ice cores, tree rings and ocean cores are also assessed.  It will be shown how tephrochronology can be used to record not only volcanic histories, but also establish, date and evaluate rates of environmental change and human-environment interactions.  Geochemical methods of characterising tephra layers will be considered next, and we will discuss how this can be used to identify sources, types of eruptions and correlate deposits. We will also have a hands-on session where we will demonstrate different types of tephra and allow you to see samples prepared for analysis. The dating of tephra layers is considered next and we will discuss the various methods of obtaining ages, including using historical information, ice core records, and radiometric dating.  There will also be an exercise in calibrating radiocarbon dates and the chronological interpretation of a complex tephra stratigraphy at an Icelandic archaeological site.The rest of the course builds on the introductory knowledge gained during the first four weeks to discuss in more detail the application of tephrochronology to volcanology, glaciology, archaeology, environmental studies and human-ecodynamics.  We will explore the interaction of volcanic activity and glaciers in Iceland, floods and the dispersion of tephra from eruptions in 1918, 1996, 2010 and 2011. We will also discuss how tephrochronology can help us to identify and date eruptions and floods from EyjafjallajÃ¶kull 6-7th and 10th centuries AD, as well as dating glacial geomorphological features and aiding our understanding of past climatic fluctuations. Before moving onto consider how tephrochronology can be applied to understand human-environment interactions, the extent of soil erosion in Iceland will be discussed and the reasons why Icelandic soils are so susceptible to being eroded. After introduction the Norse colonisation and settlement of the North Atlantic region and Iceland in particular, the next three lectures will discuss how tephrochronology can be applied to studying cultural and environmental change through chronology and landscape reconstruction.  Iceland provides a superb natural laboratory to study these interactions between the environment and people.  Precisely dated tephra layers also enable the rates of change to be calculated, which elsewhere is very difficult to measure.  We are able to explore notions of changing resilience, threshold crossing events, catastrophe cusps and early warning signals.The course finishes with a fieldtrip to East Lothian, which provides an opportunity to study exposures of Carboniferous age tephra layers and apply knowledge gained in the course.",

It draws on great writing within and beyond the discipline of geography to inspire and inform our own practice. The course teaches the craft and creativity of writing as a kind of geographical method.",
    "course_description": "The specific aim is to equip students with the knowledge and skills to apply the craft of writing to place-specific contexts. Introducing concepts such as genre, narrative and authorial voice, the course will help students to use these more carefully in their own work. Writing Landscape considers takes a critical look at the promises and pitfalls of both academic and creative writing. The intellectual anchors of the course will be found in approaches to landscape from cultural geography, psychogeography and creative non-fiction. Teaching consists of lectures, discussions, film, writing and editing workshops, as well as several instances of fieldwork. A consistent emphasis will be placed on the practice of writing, including its practice in the classroom. The assessment will give the students the opportunity to apply the lessons of the course to developing a geographical portrait of one particular Scottish site or landscape.",

It will explore the creative turn in geography and across disciplines, exploring how scholars have embraced creative methods in their research and how creative practitioners have engaged with the academic worlds of research and theory. The course will involve both engagement with creative works of others and the production of creative works.",
    "course_description": "The course focuses on the link between creativity and the environment both conceptually, and through the deployment of creative methods. There is a growing body of work both in geography and beyond on the interactions between different forms of creative intervention, ways of knowing the environment and environmental justice. This course will explore some of these ways of addressing environmental concern through both critical examination of existing creative work and workshops which will enable students to develop their own creative skills. Following an introductory week addressing the Â¿whyÂ¿ of the course, the course will be divided into five two-week blocks that will be taught by a rotating team of staff members (who will also rotate in and out of the existing course, Values and the Environment, which this course is designed to accompany). Each block will address a creative approach and every week will include both a critical element and a creative element. Indicative themes include, essays, memoir/autobiography, creative non-fiction, geopoetics, zines, graphic novels, video, photography. These themes will change depending on the staff involved.  The final two-week block will be reserved for a mini-conference/exhibition where students will share and discuss their final work.",

Please contact geoset.ug.kb@ed.ac.uk should you will to enrol and are not doing a School of Geosciences Degree ***The Earth is our home, and as far as we currently know, the only habitable planet. For over 4.5 billion years, Earth has experienced many changes due to physical processes from within and at the surface of the Earth. It has been the stage for the origin and diversification of life, from microbes to complex ecosystems including organisms such as dinosaurs and humans. Its dynamic interior and surface have built and destroyed mountains leading to the habitable continents, ocean basins, and an atmosphere that can not only sustain life but control climate.This course is intended as a foundation course for all Earth scientists, as well as students from other disciplines like biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering who wish to understand how our planet operates. The course is taught through the concept of connectivity between the evolution of life, and the physical Earth over time, plate tectonics and the rock cycle, and climate and elemental cycles. It aims to convey the relevant spatial and temporal length scales involved in Earth processes. Through lectures, innovative hands-on practical's, museum visits and geological tours of Edinburgh, and a field trip, students will come to understand how the Earth works as an integrated system of physical processes, life, and climate, and appreciate how our modern world has emerged.Weeks 1-3 The evolution of Earth and lifeWeeks 4-6 Volcanoes, earthquakes and plate tectonicsWeeks 7-9 Carbon and ClimateWeek 10 A holistic view of a changing Earth*Students who have previously taken Earth Dynamics should not take this course*",

Focusing on coastal regions allows students to explore a wide-ranging interdisciplinary understanding of the connections between social and ecological systems. This course provides an opportunity to delve deeply into ecology, environmental processes, rural issues, policy and community empowerment, and will equip students with an in-depth understanding of how our coastal interactions and decision-making can have longstanding impacts on the sea, the land and the communities that depend on them.",
    "course_description": "This course will provide students with a range of transferable skills and knowledge using coastal areas in Scotland and globally as a learning focus. It is broadly divided into three section; the first focusing on understanding coastal processes and ecology as a basis for appreciating the diversity and importance of these environments. The second focuses on human uses and values of coastlines, from blue carbon to inshore aquaculture. Finally, the third section considers these in parallel, focusing on management and policy for people and environment. Teaching will be a combination of lectures, hands-on workshops, small group project learning and field trips. Lectures will be supported by small group discussions and workshops in which they discuss and debate relevant challenges and examples in depth. The field trips are designed to gain hands-on experience and understanding of coastal surveying and management, and an appreciation of the complexity of the environment and related decisions.During the class teaching weeks (9), there will be approximately 2 hours of lectures and 2 hours of group discussion/tutorial based learning per session. There are also two weeks of planned field trips.The content is subject to development, but an indicative weekly syllabus would be:1. Class: Introduction- definitions, why coasts are important, global status.2. Class: Coastal processes- geomorphology, erosion.3. Class: Coastal intertidal ecology- communities, patterns, trends.4. Class: Coastal subtidal ecology- kelp forests, marine nurseries.5. Field trip: Coastal surveying- intertidal surveys, ROVs.6. Class: Coastal communities- depopulation, empowerment, climate challenges.7. Class: Blue carbon- coasts and climate change, impacts and adaptation.8. Class: Coastal economies- aquaculture, seaweed farming, fishing, subsistence.9. Class: Coastal management- MPAs, marine spatial planning.10. Class: Coastal policy- national and international policy and legislation.11. Field trip: People and coasts- marine management, aquaculture, community engagements.The proposed location of the first field trip is a shore relatively local to Edinburgh on the east coast, e.g. North Berwick. A proposed location of the second field trip would be on the west coast in a heavy use area, e.g. to the Clyde area.",

    "summary": "'The struggle for life is the struggle for available energy'.  This quote attributed to the physicist and philosopher Ludwig Boltzmann highlights how important energy is in our lives.  Indeed, all our other material resources could be provided for (and indeed recycled) if we had a limitless supply of cheap energy. Alas, the dream of civilian use of nuclear fusion remains 50 years away whilst our current energy system has proved to be rather expensive once we started to observe and learned to account for all the social and environmental harms it creates.Some of the most iconic inventions in human history are directly related to the increase of energy services e.g. the control of fire, the invention of the wheel, the telecoms and digital data revolutions.  Our innate understanding of the importance of energy is evidenced not only though our dreams and creativity but even through our spirituality.  Take for example the first page of the book of Genesis: God's first act of creation was to switch the light on before eventually creating the consumers of this energy service energy.  It is a vision of creation which features the ultimate engineer, taking a supply-side approach to our energy needs (and by inference, designing humans to use the daylight that was pre-provided).Many of the energy challenges we face in the 21st century are more to do with demand side understanding the complexity of human desires, values and behaviour in relation to energy use. It would be a gross simplification to see these challenges, summarised in the energy trilemma (clean, affordable & secure energy), as mainly technical problems; they are more to do with the social and political issues associated with changing our energy system.  In other words, the operating space of human engineers is determined by social, economic and political processes.Most existing post graduate courses on energy are of a technical nature.  But energy is a meta-resource and its use is a key dimension structuring lives, communities and societies. This course encourages students to look at society through the energy lens and unpack our overdependence on scarce and contested resources, the disconnect between consumption and wellbeing, the social impacts of energy provision and the lock-in and externalising effects of energy provision under incumbent (and unsustainable) energy regimes and associated technologies. The course cuts across scales from the domestic to the national and international, seeking to draw lessons from historical energy transitions and from comparative analysis in different national, geographical, political and socio-economic contexts.",
    "course_description": "This is a core course for the MSc in Energy, Society and Sustainability  (delivered collaboratively by the schools of Geosciences and Social & Political Sciences),  and it  was set up in recognition of the pedagogic imperative for students to explore the numbers behind politicized discussions on our energy future (e.g. the cost of new nuclear, the intermittency of renewables, the scope for improved energy efficiency), as well as to learn to draw on social science thinking (beyond economics!) and even humanities  to develop a deeper and richer understanding of energy transitions as societal transitions and draw on historic, geographical and sectoral analogies to explore the possible futures of the transition we aspire to now; i.e. the fair transition to a low carbon society  -  in the face of the threat of runaway climate change.  The course will seek to cover a broad range of energy topics, but in the lectures we will draw particular attention to (a) energy justice and (b) urban governance.",

    "summary": "This is a core course for the MSc in Energy, Society and Sustainability, and is intended to provide a methodological foundation for the dissertation.To provide a suite of methods, both practical and conceptual, that will enable students to construct and analyse a real world fieldsite which develops Energy, Society, and Sustainability issues. Students will collaborate together, and with a low-carbon community, to create projects that enact these methods in practice.The course is a collaboration with local communities and organisations in the Orkney islands, who have their different energy and sustainability concerns. It will immediately immerse students in real world problems and questions, providing support for experimentation and exploration of practical methods, in a living context.The course is based on a social and technical approach to understanding energy and sustainability as both relations and infrastructures. How can energy infrastructures, such as the electricity grid, be understood as social, technical, and environmental, and how does that create particular questions and insights? How are low-carbon worlds being made, for whom, and in what places, drawing on which relations and invisible labours? How can methods be made to both understand and intervene in these energy infrastructures and sustainability issues? Drawing on case studies and methods from Geography to Science & Technology Studies to Anthropology, with a foundation provided by the first semester, this course will be structured around the development of a collaborative project, which will then be enacted in Orkney during the fieldtrip.Orkney, an archipelago off the northeast coast of mainland Scotland, generates over 120% of its electricity from renewable energy. This comes from local-owned wind turbines, including over seven hundred micro wind turbines, as well as wave and tide energy (they are the site of the European Marine Energy Centre). The islands have had a smart grid for a decade, and are also generating hydrogen fuel. They call themselves a 'living laboratory' for energy futures, yet they also have severe problems with fuel poverty and an electricity grid which is at capacity. Students will have the opportunity to collaborate with a number of local organisations and communities in the islands, to address their very real issues and concerns, particularly around the digitisation of energy.",
    "course_description": "The course comprises two parts:Part 1 MethodsDrawing on interdisciplinary resources, and a series of exemplar case studies, students will develop a methodological toolkit. For example: how to develop a research question and construct a field site; the role and effects of different qualitative data; mixed media fieldsite recording and engagement; writing as research (e.g. different writing methods for community and policy engagement).Part 2 FieldtripWith the project developed in Part 1, students will travel to Orkney, to enact their projects in collaboration with energy communities there, gather data, and gain direct feedback from those they are working with.Fieldtrip dates: Saturday 7th April - Saturday 12th April 2025",

Each student should individually write a  3-page literature survey of the paper and related papers. This should be submitted on Learn (deadline Friday of week 10 at 12 noon) and is assessed (20% of course mark). The hand-in should address the questions: what was done in the paper and related literature (for the papers without a reference  list or very short one, eg Ruddiman, you should find literature that cites it), how was it done, and how does it relate to in the course.

There will be ten  1hour seminars over the semester. In seven  of the seminars, the lecturer will outline the key ideas for the next fortnights reading and have some discussion on the previous reading. These seminars will occur roughly fortnightly and be interspersed with four seminars organised as question and answer sessions, driven by student need. In these seminars the lecturer will help students with material that they have found difficult. Students are expected to spend 9 hours/week working through readings; doing problems etc.The course functions on the assumption that level 11 students are mature enough to be self-learners. So students will be expected, perhaps with some guidance, to seek out additional material and read some literature.To supplement the theoretical study practical training in how to run the Unified Model (or other climate models).

    "summary": "This course is an introduction to Earth observation for beginners and non-technical people (contains no mathematics or substantive quantitative analysis). The primary aim is to provide students with a well-grounded understanding of the important insights provided by satellite observations with an emphasis on how this data can be used to monitor or evaluate progress on sustainable development goals (SDGs).",
    "course_description": "This course examines how satellite data of the Earth can be used in the context of Sustainable Development Goals, and the easy-to-access tools than can be used to apply such data to practical SDG issues (such as monitoring and reporting). It starts with an introductory overview of the principles of remote sensing from space, and the narratives, and origin, of SDGs.  It considers the operational elements of monitoring, such as completeness of data, uncertainties and costs, as well as introducing students to the practical use of satellite data, using data analytics tools that have a shallow learning curve but allow students quick access to EO data. Such platforms include EO Browser, Google Earth and Earth Blox, all of which are web-based, requiring no local installation or specialised computing hardware. The bulk of the course looks at 4 SDGs in particular (2, 11, 13, 15), as the easiest examples of how EO data can be used to inform decision makers, or contribute to the broader SDG narrative.The course concludes by looking at some specific examples of recent application of EO data in a SDG context.Outline:1. Introduction to satellite remote sensing and SDGs.  Firstly, covering: the fundamentals of electromagnetic waves, electromagnetic spectrum, active vs passive remote sensing systems, how to represent multi-band images on a screen, defining different kinds of resolution,  the limitation of low Earth orbit. And secondly: the history of SDGs, the policy context of the SDG narrative, critical perspectives and wider development context.2. The ethics of Satellite Data. Examining some of the legal, moral and ethical issues around satellite data. Explores the topics of ownership of data, access rights to data, permission (or lack of) for acquiring imagery, and the asymmetries of users ability to extract useful information from such data.3. Monitoring SDG 13 Climate Action. Considers the Earth Radiation Budget and planetary albedo. Consider RGB colour composites of different wavelengths. Compare the results from different spectral bands. Introduces pros and cons of using satellites and different orbit types. Uses examples of extreme weather events. Practical element: visual assessment of different spatial resolutions; looking at recent extreme weather events.4. Monitoring SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. Look at patterns of population density and how they compare to night lights.  Learn how to map flooding events using Sentinel-1 radar data and estimate the area. Practical Element: Do an area comparison. Compare these to air pollution observations.  Overlay flood map with population maps. View shipping routes using SAR.5. Monitoring SDG 2: Zero Hunger. Understanding NDVI using Sentinel-2. Learning how to visualise and output a time series of NDVI. Practical Element: Conduct some land classification for agricultural monitoring.  Look at drought metrics and desertification in the Sahel.  Consideration of environmental stress indicators.6. Monitoring SDG 15 Life on Land. Use NDVI again to look at forest cover. Use Hansen forest loss/gain and PALSAR radar to see changes in forest cover over time.  Determine area metrics.  Explore the visualisation of radar data from Sentinel 1, using different polarisations and time series. Practical Element: Calculate forest biomass parameters from PALSAR. Look at trends in forest fires and make an estimate of forest biomass lost.7. Real World Case Studies. STRATA: UNEP environmental climate stress indicator.  Examples from the UKSA IPP programme.

The course continues by examining Object-Oriented and Object-Relational approaches, together with issues important to GIS such as hybrid vs. integrated data models and the long transaction. The means of encoding spatial data such that it can be held and queried within formal database management systems is examined. The course extends student's knowledge of commercial data models, reviewing their advantages and disadvantages, together with looking at case studies of database management in the commercial GIS environment. Further themes include 'big data', spatial data mining, performance, indexing and spatial metadata. Practical exercises extend the studentÂ¿s knowledge of standard SQL, examine Oracle Spatial in detail and introduce PostgreSQL / POSTGIS and MySQL and its spatial extension.",

    "course_description": "This course builds on Foundations in Ecological Economics. The purpose of the course is to facilitate students in acquiring deeper, specialist knowledge about topic areas within Ecological Economics in which they are interested. Because the course is focused on creating opportunities for students to pursue their own interests, much of the content of this course will be either student-led or come from a process of co-creation with staff. There will also be formal elements of peer/self-review. Thus, students who pursue this course should have clear interests in Ecological Economics, a high degree of self-motivation, and a collaborative spirit.Students will receive training in evidence synthesis, and will then design, conduct, and write up a review on a topic area of their own choosing within Ecological Economics. The methodological training will equip students with a skill that is useful much more broadly than this course (including in research and post-MSc employment). The result of the review will be a much deeper understanding of one part of Ecological Economics as a discipline.Students will also receive training and guidance in designing and delivering workshops (focused, specifically, on educational and knowledge exchange workshops). Students will act on this training by designing and delivering a workshop to educate their peers on the outcomes of their review.Finally, students will reflect on what they have learned from their peersÂ¿ workshops, and how this expands up and refines the foundational Ecological Economics knowledge they gained in semester 1.The course will be conducted primarily using a flipped-classroom, which means students will need to prepare in specific ways (e.g. by completing readings and pre-recorded lectures) prior to coming to class.In the first 7 weeks, class time will be spent advancing, and getting feedback on studentsÂ¿ evidence synthesis pieces. Feedback will come from both staff and students. The remaining weeks of class will be focused on the design and delivery of the workshops (where, again, feedback will come from both students and staff).Following the completing of class-based activities, students will have a period to reflect, synthetically, on their learning.",

    "course_description": "This course is organised and delivered using a flipped-classroom design. This means that class time is spent almost entirely undertaking activities that help you practice conducting analyses with the methods covered in the course, and then linking these analyses to particular decision contexts. Over the course of the semester you will get practice thinking about and communicating what the implications of your analyses are for real-world problems related to Ecological Economics and Sustainability. You will also get the opportunity to practice developing a host of transferable skills related to working in interdisciplinary teams.The particular variety of flipped-classroom used in this course means that most of the assessments for the semester will be completed and submitted during class time. This requires students to complete assigned readings/prep work and in some cases to complete practice exercises before coming to class, but also means the workload is fairly stable/constant over the term once the course has gotten underway. The course is split into 5 units, each of which focuses on one method. The methods are chosen from:Cost Benefit AnalysisSocial Multi-Criteria AnalysisQ MethodologyLifecycle AnalysisAgent-Based ModellingBayesian Belief NetworksParticipatory Systems ModellingStock-and-Flow Systems ModellingIn each unit, students will be asked to read selected background information on the method and to complete some other specific preparation for the unit. In order to ensure both individual and team accountability, there will be short quizzes on this material at the start of each unit during class. Students will be given a walk-through exercise to make it clear how to complete an analysis using the method in question (inclusive of a discussion of how to make the link between interpreting outcomes and making recommendations in a particular, sustainability-related decision context) before subsequently being asked, in teams, to complete a challenge largely independently of the unit leader. The recommendations made by the team, based on the interpretations of the outcomes of this independent analysis will be submitted in class and will form part of the mark of the course. There are a number of checks and balances built into the course to ensure that teams are productive and functional, and to protect individuals from some of the problems that can arise in teams. Email the course organiser for more information.The culmination of the course is the final essay. For this essay, each individual will select one of the methods covered in the course. Using the assignment pack provided for that method (containing the problem, starting references, and starting data), each individual will then complete the required analysis and write up the results in a miniature journal article. This assignment allows individuals to showcase their skills and also to practice the kind of analysis they may wish to pursue in their dissertation research.Throughout the course there is an emphasis on interpretation, making decisions, and in explaining the justifications for the decisions made. The course is suitable for all students interested in methods that are useful for shining light on different dimensions of sustainability problems in a way that is useful for decision makers.",

They each have a particular story to tell - a 'real-world' example of a problem that they had to address (individually or as part of a team). Like you, our alumni come from different backgrounds, have had very different experiences, and work in (and with) a variety of industries. They personify the breadth of roles a Carbon Master may choose from upon completion of the programme.Carbon: Each of the problems presented by our guest speakers are in some way related to carbon and/or the climate. Some of those links may be less obvious that others. They range from behaviour change to technology to business strategy, and beyond.Methods: In these seminars, the speaker will walk us through how they approached their particular problem; what worked, what didn't, and (most importantly) why. From origination to scoping to methods to output. Through them, we will begin to appreciate there is a multitude of ways to address almost any problem - many will be 'wrong', but there is also (usually) more than one 'right' way to do so.",

The course has a focus on mixed methodsresearch by introducing students to quantitative and qualitative skills that can be used independently but that are increasingly used in combination with one another.The course is structured around lectures followed by small group tutorials, a format which caters for students with very varied backgrounds. There is also a focus on getting your hands dirty, collecting and analysing your own data set, as well as working with other larger data sets. The course is aimed at those with an undergraduate in either social or natural science. It is introductory in the sense that it assumes no prior experience of either, but quickly moves to Masters Level in both.Wk 1: Course Introduction; overview of doing environmental and social sciences; what makes science 'good'? Introduction to RStudio;Wk 2: Epistemology case study, theory in social science and starting to plan researchWk 3: Thinking critically about scienceWk 4: Quantitative Skills 1: Thinking about data, how to describe it and how to visualise itWk 5: Quantitative Skills 2: Introduction to statistical modelsWk 6: Qualitative Skills 1: Developing and designing qualitative research toolsWk 7: Data collection and/or drop-in to class for support on group work Wk 8: Qualitative Skills 2: Analysing Qualitative DataWk 9: Quantitative Skills 3: Linear regressionWk 10: Doing mixed methods research in practiceWk 11: Course overview and reflections on methods",

This may be taken as part of research training requirements relating to human geography and other relevant courses in the School of GeoSciences, College of Science and Engineering (CSE), or as part of training within the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (CAHSS). Whatever your purpose in being on the course, you're most welcome: the teaching staff are here to help you get the most from the course and to support your research degree.In this course, we will examine the nature of an archive (as a physical entity and as a collection), the questions of power, authority and responsibility that underlie use of and access to archives, and we will together visit a series of archives/archival holdings to engage in first-hand experience of these matters. It is intended to be of particular benefit to those whose research work, either for a research or a taught MSc, or as part of a research training programme for an MPhil or PhD degree, is likely to involve significant attention to manuscript/written historical sources, to 'archived' material of whatever nature, and to its analysis and interpretation.Central to the course is a series of archive field visits. At each we will consider the nature of an archive (as a physical entity, a collection, and a responsibility), and the questions of power and authority that underlie use of, and access to, archives as 'knowledge repositories'. These archive field visits will provide you with the basis to the assessment for the course.The course is taught in a mixture of lectures, tutorials and archive visits. The course will be taught by Professor Charles W. J. Withers in association with archive and library staff within several leading archives and records repositories in the city of Edinburgh.",

Students will acquire general knowledge of standard and advanced power generation technologies and understanding of their respective strengths and weaknesses. Consequently, based on this understanding, students will be introduced to a range of CO2 capture technologies, ranging from those commercially available to technologies still in the development stage. They will acquire a thorough understanding of each technology and its operating principle and will be able to associate particular CO2 capture technology to a relevant power generation process, taking into account strengths and weaknesses of each capture technology and its compatibility with different power generation processes. Following that, students will learn about the issues related to compression and transport of captured CO2 stream. They will be presented with different ways of CO2 transport and will become familiar with topics such as CO2 properties under transport conditions, impurities present in CO2 streams from different generation/capture systems and the effects of impurities on CO2 compression and transport. In addition, the risks associated with CO2 transport will be discussed. Besides technologies for CO2 capture from power generation and industries, atmospheric CO2 capture, and other negative emissions technologies will also be covered.

    "course_description": "This course examines the key issues of climate economics, and the tools that economists developed to interpret and address these issues.It starts with an introductory overview of the rationale of economics, environmental economics, and ecological economics, with a brief mention of behavioural economics as well. It then delves into economics by introducing how markets work and how a well-functioning market mechanism can allocate resources efficiently.The course then moves to environmental economics by considering market failures that have an effect on the environment. This includes the view of anthropogenic climate change as a global externality and the discussion of various policy instruments aimed at addressing this market failure and mitigating climate change (e.g., carbon taxation, cap & trade). This leads then to studying and comparing the tools used to make an economic evaluation of climate changeÂ¿prices from emission trading, emission abatement costs, social cost of carbon.Then, the topic of uncertainty in economic knowledge is introduced, with the study of debates around the challenges of forecasting, uncertainty, risk, irreversibility, and discounting. This leads to the consideration of how some behavioural economics topics relate to the environment.Finally, the course concludes by opening up discussions beyond mainstream economic thinking to explore alternative economic systems and perspectives, with particular attention to ecological economics ideas.Some questions which will be considered in the course:- How do we understand the interactions between economy, society, and the environment?- What are the best economic policy measures for responding to climate change?- What are the costs associated with climate change?- How do we cope with uncertainty in our economic knowledge?- How can our understandings of human behaviour encourage a more low-carbon behaviour and a more climate change-aware decision making in individuals, households, major companies, and states?- What is the role of economic concepts and tools in addressing climate change? Can and/or should this role change, and how?",

Some of the key themes that run through the course are the inter-relation and balance between economic and environmental decision-making; the consequences of upstream and downstream interventions; the imposition or adoption of regulations and incentives for environmental change; power and control over decision-making; and the role of experts and trust in information.The use of these approaches at different levels of governance in a range of key sectors is considered, mainly on a case study basis through lectures and fieldwork. The course encourages a strongly interdisciplinary approach to the understanding of sustainable development and seeks to foster critical thinking and debate.Tailored training, and discussions with experts from science, policy and practice will explain the characteristics and importance of effectively communicating core messages. Students develop group projects and liaise with contacts at the Department of Social Responsibility and Sustainability (SRS). Project work will be presented in class and field questions from class and representatives from SRS.At the end of Semester 2, students will attend a week-long residential field course to central Scotland and the Scottish Highlands and Islands. The field course provides the opportunity for students to experience sustainable development in practice and reflect on the range of initiatives taking place across a range of sectors in Scotland. Students will complete a series of blog posts to reflect on their experiences on the field course.",

These social inequalities, such as unequal access to land and resources, have been driven by legacies of colonialism and empire which are still in force today. In this course we will begin by examining how racial and climate justice are not, and have never been, distinct projects but instead are two sides of the same coin. The course will explore the key pathways towards sustainable transformations and consider the implications of a racial justice lens in achieving these pathways. This will pave the way towards a more critical focus on imagining alternative futures where achieving racial justice becomes the system goal, drawing on movements such as reparations and abolitionism. The course will use the Environmental Justice Atlas as a resource to ground the learning in real world environmental conflicts. This course encourages students to think critically about using inter-disciplinary methods in sustainability research to not simply Â¿includeÂ¿ but to centre a racial justice lens in order to contribute to building more just socio-ecological futures.",
    "course_description": "There will be two main threads to the course: in-class activity and out of class activity. In class activity will consist of class themes each week, where class discussions will respond to certain prompts. All of these discussions will draw upon key concepts used in economics (specifically ecological economics), to critically reflect on the implications of understanding such concepts through a racial justice lens. The out of class activities will largely consist of individual self-reflection work as well as collaboration through teamwork on a group project which will revolve around case studies drawn from the Environmental Justice Atlas.",

Thus, more than an environmental challenge, in this course climate change is viewed as a trigger of market transition, where controls on greenhouse gas emissions will affect virtually all sectors of the economy to varying degrees. For some this transition represents risks and constraints, for others, an opportunity. Decision makers and leaders must therefore equip themselves with the strategic analytical tools necessary to analyse an organisation's positioning on climate change vis-Ã -vis competitors, interests and other strategic considerations. This course provides students with the tools to enable them to become world class strategists.",

It is going to be a challenging year, but we hope that this design will enable you to continue learning despite the changes we face. Note that as the pandemic progresses, things may change, and we ask you to be patient as we adjust to a new way of teaching and working.The course consists of 10 lectures. All of the core course materials are available via Blackboard Learn, our online teaching portal. The lectures are designed to be delivered Â¿asynchronouslyÂ¿ so that you can go through the material in your own time at home. Each lecture is made up of a mix of pre-recorded mini videos, texts and readings. The material will become available on a week-by-week basis. This is to help you manage your time and self-study. We encourage you to follow the week-by-week structure as far as possible so that the assessments align with the learning and you get the most out of the tutorials.Discussion, debate, and sharing ideas with staff and students is all part of the learning experience. So, while we may not be able to meet in person, the Course Organiser will host weekly live virtual seminars using Blackboard Collaborate. We will use these student-centred interactive sessions to discuss elements of topics in more depth. Please sign up to one seminar slot Â¿ they  are allocated on a first-come-first basis, and you are expected to stay in the same time slot for the full semester. You are encouraged to make as many of these live sessions as possible, but should you need to miss one, they will be recorded and stored on Learn.",

Bearing in mind that the course is targeted at students with little or no economics background, the course provides some basic economic knowledge useful to understand the more specialized branches of economics addressed in the course, and encourages the students to critically reflect - also in the light of their non-economic background - on the assumptions made in economics. The main questions addressed in the course include:(1): What are the costs of climate change? What are the costs of responding to climate change? What are the most appropriate economic policy measures for responding to climate change?(2): How do economic tools cope with uncertainty?(3): Why do individuals, companies, and countries make at times decisions that affect the environment negatively? What decisions are 'rational' from an economic perspective, and are they reasonable from an environmental one? Are there ways to influence these decisions, and is it ethical to do so?(4): How do we understand the interactions between economy, society and the environment? How do different economic theories and worldviews influence our way of life and our impact on the Earth? What can the economic field learn from other disciplines and cultures?",

That means we can no longer solely focus on mitigating climate change; we also need to adapt to its impacts. In 'Foundations of Climate Change' (on campus), you learnt about the different drivers of climate change and the political framework in which we work. In this course we build on this knowledge and introduce the foundations of climate change impacts and adaptation. We will explore these impacts across scales, geographies, sectors, and ecosystems. We will discuss the inequalities and injustices which exists, the connections between climate change relates and sustainable development, and how we can make the right choices to build resilient development pathways and effectively manage risk.",

We will, however, have some Positions and Interventions being presented, which are podcasts, missives or live talks from experts, stakeholders, academics, business, etc. We will discuss as we go along what Positions and Interventions you would like to hear about and organise to involve them during the course. For example, you might focus on a given mitigation topic, say stratospheric aerosol injection, and wish to make contact with a meteorologist, climatologist or engineer who works on this or has studied the issue. We will assist you in identifying scientists (initially from within University of Edinburgh) and, where appropriate, we will ask that expert to do a short presentation, either live or recorded, and to be available for a Q&A session. Such a session would not need to involve the whole class, but rather those who are investigating this option, though we will aim to make recordings available to all.

    "summary": "The primary aim of this course is to provide participants with high-level understanding of key environmental accounting techniques, specifically carbon footprinting and ecosystem service valuation. Key methodologies will be introduced during lectures and students will be required to demonstrate their understanding through applied assessments. This knowledge will prepare students for research and future careers in the areas of carbon accounting and environmental economics. This course also aims to prepare students for effective group work.",
    "course_description": "This course focuses on the two main ways to measure climate change impacts:Carbon Footprinting and Auditing: this course will discuss the history of footprinting and eco-labelling and the various schemes which exist internationally. Students will be introduced to the various footprinting and labelling methodologies and how consistency and reliability is maintained through auditing. This course will cover product and corporate carbon footprinting in detail. Students will come away from the course with specific skills in the calculative practices associated with carbon accounting.Ecosystem services are defined as the benefits that humans received from nature. Flows of ecosystem services are likely to be strongly affected by climate change. This part of the course explores the ways in which ecosystem services and changes in levels of services can be valued, measured and monetized by society, across the spectrum from aesthetic to extractive values. Both theoretical and practical applications of ecosystem valuation are explored through case studies of policies and projects. Real-world examples of ecosystem services being valued are presented, and current policy responses are examined including payments for ecosystem services projects, biodiversity offsets, certification schemes and REDD+. This part of the course encourages you to think creatively and critically about ecosystem services concepts and their use in varied valuation exercises.*This course is run and taught by co-Course Organisers: Dr James Paterson and Dr Erika Warnatzsch",

We will, however, have some Positions and Interventions being presented, which are podcasts, missives or live talks from experts, stakeholders, academics, business, etc. We will discuss as we go along what Positions and Interventions you would like to hear about and organise to involve them during the course. For example, you might focus on a given mitigation topic, say stratospheric aerosol injection, and wish to make contact with a meteorologist, climatologist or engineer who works on this or has studied the issue. We will assist you in identifying scientists (initially from within University of Edinburgh) and, where appropriate, we will ask that expert to do a short presentation, either live or recorded, and to be available for a Q&A session. Such a session would not need to involve the whole class, but rather those who are investigating this option, though we will aim to make recordings available to all. You are also invited to make your own Position and Intervention presentations, for example on topics which you feel strongly about or feel have been neglected and which you wish to bring to wider attention, or just as an opportunity to learn more about a topic.",

The focus is global though examples will frequently draw upon experience in the UK and other parts of Europe.The course explores the need for managing emissions within known carbon budgets, therefore requiring deep greenhouse gas emission cuts and achievement of carbon neutrality (= net carbon zero) by mid-21st century in many developed countries. Scenarios of possible future emissions will be presented and analysed and the adequacy of emission control targets at the international and national scales will be presented and critically evaluated. The challenge of the multiple-agendas and drivers at work in addition to climate change, including Â¿energy securityÂ¿, Â¿energy costsÂ¿, Â¿land-useÂ¿ and Â¿consumptionÂ¿, will be explored and the implications drawn-out. The Â¿three domains / three pillarsÂ¿ approach, which allows for a coherent approach to understanding carbon mitigation efforts from the behavioural and practice-focused (e.g. energy efficiency), to market-based instruments and then, further, to systemic, larger-scale and longer-term innovation processes, is presented and explained.

As a result, we have designed this course to enable you to get the full learning experience whether you are working from home or from the university campus. It is going to be a challenging year, but we hope that this design will enable you to continue learning despite the changes we face. Note that as the pandemic progresses, things may change, and we ask you to be patient as we adjust to a new way of teaching and working.The course is 11 weeks long (including a reading week in week 6), consisting of 10 lectures. All of the core course materials are available via Blackboard Learn, our online teaching portal. The lectures are designed to be delivered Â¿asynchronouslyÂ¿ so that you can go through the material in your own time at home. Each lecture is made up of a mix of pre-recorded mini videos, texts and readings. The material will become available on a week-by-week basis. This is to help you manage your time and self-study. We encourage you to follow the week-by-week structure as far as possible so that the assessments align with the learning and you get the most out of the tutorials.This is not designed to be a correspondence course, and you will not be left on your own to go through it. We understand and appreciate that discussion, debate, and sharing ideas with staff and students is all part of the learning experience. So, while we may not be able to meet in person, we will still all meet weekly in a virtual tutorial session using Blackboard Collaborate to discuss the weekÂ¿s topics. These sessions will take place on Thursdays between 14:00 and 15:30* (Edinburgh local time) and be hosted by the course co-ordinator and course tutor(s).  You are encouraged to make as many of these live sessions as possible, but should you need to miss one, they will be recorded and stored on Learn.*this may change depending on student locations, or an additional time may be added as required.",

The principles of numerical model development will be explored along with the fundamental processes governing heat and mass transport in the subsurface environment with a specific focus on applications for geothermal systems and reactive transport of hazardous industrial contaminants. Students will develop and program their own numerical model to better understand these concepts, their application and the underlying mathematics.",
    "course_description": "Numerical models are now vital tools in hydrogeology as many applications require the incorporation of complex geology and numerous interconnected environmental processes. For instance, geothermal energy installations, remediation schemes for sites contaminated with hazardous wastes, as well as groundwater abstractions for drinking, agriculture and industrial usages all require the use of numerical models for successful implementation and to minimize negative environmental impacts. While commercial hydrogeological software packages are now available, an understanding of both their development and the governing processes they describe are required to properly utilize and, if necessary, modify. This course will cover all the steps of model development from conceptualization, through to implementation with programming languages, and finally model validation and calibration. Model development will be taught in the context of heat and mass transport processes in hydrogeological systems, specifically with geothermal systems and reactive transport at sites contaminated with hazardous chemicals. The course will cover fundamental heat and mass transport processes such as conduction and convection, advection and dispersion, reaction kinetics, sorption isotherms, as well as the mathematics required to program these processes using finite difference numerical techniques. During this process, students will learn how to critically assess numerical modelling reports to identify their underlying assumptions, limitations, and sources of inaccuracies.The course lectures develop the students knowledge base with advancing concepts that are supported by practical programming, numerical modelling, and report writing and critical evaluation. This is aimed at developing technical, interpretation and reporting skills and encourage critical thinking. The concepts developed in the taught programme are reinforced with a project wherein students are given a specific hydrogeological scenario that they must develop, program, and implement their own numerical model to simulate and write a professional modelling report on.Proposed course outline:Unit 1: Introduction to Numerical ModellingOverview of the modelling processDifferent types of modelsUsefulness and limitations of numerical models.Introduction to programming concepts and good coding practices to be used throughout the courseUnit 2: 'Lumped box' modelsHow to use a mass balance approach to construct a governing differential equationHow to solve a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) with a finite difference approachEuler vs. Runge-Kutta approaches to finite differenceEstimating error and instabilities in numerical methodsUnit 3: Modelling Advection/Convection and Dispersion/ConductionWhat are advection and dispersion/diffusionWhat are convection and conductionDeriving the governing equations1D finite difference solution techniquesBoundary conditionsImplicit vs explicit methodsUnit 4: Modelling Advection+DispersionChoosing the appropriate form of governing equation with dimensionless numbers2D finite difference solution techniquesCorner boundary conditionsTransient vs steady-state solutionsUnit 5: Contaminant TransportTypes and sources of contaminantsSorption isotherms and retardation coefficientsColloids and filtrationReaction kineticsIncorporation into ADEUnit 6: Groundwater flowDeriving the groundwater flow equation2D finite difference techniquesUnit 7: Model calibration and verification/validationStatistical measures for goodness to fitWhat is a good fit?How do you verify and validate?What is a sensitivity study?",

    "summary": "In this course, we provide an introduction to climate change and use corals as a focal point to explore how global conventions and other international frameworks help to govern marine biodiversity and human activities in an era of rapid climate change. In doing so, this course covers foundations in both tropical and cold-water (deep-sea) coral biology, ecology, geology, and corals as sentinels of climate change. The course also explores the human dimension: ecosystem services, impacts of human activities, marine protected areas, climate resilience-building approaches, and international policies in place to protect and manage these ecosystems.",
    "course_description": "Overall, the Corals in a Changing Ocean course has 3 main elements:i. Weekly lectures: Our lectures will provide an introduction to climate change and coral ecosystems. In this course, we will provide you with the breadth of knowledge needed to understand coral ecosystems as fully socio-ecological systems, their biology, ecology and geological development and use as environmental archives (proxies), threats from climate change and human pressures, governance of key issues and solutions to these challenges. Most lectures are done in person and live, but some guest lectures may be online.ii.\tTutorial: For some weeks, we might have various practical exercises to help consolidate learning and put into practice things weÂ¿ve learned in the lectures, including: coral identification; coral habitat mapping and analysis; video analysis and annotation; case studies of fisheries management, discussion groups. This will help prepare you for the Coral Site Comparison Assessment being arranged by Dr Sebastian Hennige.iii.\tMock Parliamentary Select Committee: The knowledge base and skills developed over weeks 1-10 will help prepare the class for a real-world governance process in managing coral ecosystems in a changing ocean, a Parliamentary Select Committee in week 11. In the UK, the Science and Technology Committee (STC) helps ensure that UK government policy and decision-making are based on robust scientific advice and evidence. During week 3, each student will choose a role in the STC, either as a Member of Parliament (MP) or as a witness. MPs and witnesses prepare White Papers and Briefings, respectively. To support their case, all students will present their own White Paper or Briefing in Week 11 during a Mock Parliamentary Select Committee, with witnesses submitting their Briefing to MPs by week 10, and MPs submitting their White Paper in week 12.",

There is a growing body of work both in geography and beyond on the interactions between different forms of creative intervention, ways of knowing the environment and environmental justice. This course will explore some of these ways of addressing environmental concern through both critical examination of existing creative work and workshops which will enable students to develop their own creative skills. Following an introductory week addressing the Â¿whyÂ¿ of the course, the course will be divided into five two-week blocks that will be taught by a rotating team of staff members (who will also rotate in and out of the existing course, Values and the Environment, which this course is designed to accompany). Each block will address a creative approach and every week will include both a critical element and a creative element. Indicative themes include, essays, memoir/autobiography, creative non-fiction, geopoetics, zines, graphic novels, video, photography. These themes will change depending on the staff involved.  The final two-week block will be reserved for a mini-conference/exhibition where students will share and discuss their final work.",

The course will provide students with combined skills of statistical data analysis, computer literacy, and resultsÂ¿ interpretation applied to real-world cases regarding food insecurity, malnutrition, poverty,  food production and consumption. The course will complement the academic focus of other courses (e.g., Frameworks to assess Food Security Â¿ MSc Food Security).",
    "course_description": "The course will cover the following topics during the first semester:Week 1 Â¿ Introductory lectureIn this lecture, the students will be introduced to the topic of data processing and analysis. The importance of the knowledge that will be acquired from the course for their academic (e.g., MSc dissertation) and professional carrier (e.g., jobs) will be highlighted. In addition, the students will be provided with information on (1) the structure of the course, (2) a brief description of each lecture and the skills that will be learnt, and (3) a brief description of the case studies that will be discussed in the lectures as well the dataset that will be used for each case study.PART I: DATA TYPES, THEIR COLLECTION AND PREPARATION FOR ANALYSISWeek 2 - Data types and collectionIn this lecture, the students will learn about:types of data and what they are used for (e.g., secondary, data, primary data, and other classification such as cross-section data, time series, and panel data)main methods of data collection for qualitative and quantitative research as well as their pros and cons.how to design and conduct surveysActivities in class:Discussing examples of existing data (e.g., FAO data, World Bank data, and Eurostat data)Discussing the topic and the structure of the survey that the students will use to collect data for the main assignment of the course.Week 3 - Data preparation and visualisationIn this lecture, the students will learn:How to prepare data for analysis, including data entry, cleaning (e.g., dealing with missing values, out-of-range values, nulls, outlier values), editing (e.g., types of variables, transforming variables, creating new variables), and formatting (e.g., labelling variables)How to perform a descriptive analysis with examples in Excel and Rstudio:Univariate analysis: this will mainly cover frequency distribution, central tendency (e.g., mean, median, mode), and dispersion (e.g., range, percentiles, variance).Data visualisation: the student will be taught how to generate and use histograms, box plots, pie charts, and interactive charts. Other visualisation tools such as scatter plots and crosstabs will be taught in Week 4.Activities in class:use examples of datasets relevant to food security (e.g., FAO and World Bank data) to practice the knowledge gained on:processing raw data and preparing them for descriptive analysiscompute basic food security indicators and visualise them (e.g., the prevalence of food insecurity, malnutrition, and poverty across countries and over time).PART II: DATA ANALYSISAll the lectures on data analysis will include computer lab sessions where participants are provided with data analysis software (e.g., Rstudio) to learn how to use real databases to estimate and test data analysis models taught in the lectures and gain hands-on experience in using new techniques for practical applications. By examining actual case studies, students will become familiar with problems of model formulation, estimation, testing, and forecasting.Week 4 Â¿ Understanding statistical associationStatistical association (not causality) is one of the simplest forms of statistical analysis used to find out if there is a relationship between two variables (e.g., income and diet quality), the degree of association if one does exist, and whether one variable may be predicted from another.In this lecture, the students will learn how to analyse the relationship (association/dependence and not causal relationship) between different types of variables and how to select the most appropriate statistical test. The lecture will cover:Probability distributionHypothesis testingTesting association between two continuous variables (e.g., correlation test, Spearman Rank Correlation)Testing association between two categorical variables (e.g., Chi-square test)Testing association between a continuous variable and a categorical variable (e.g., One-sample t-test, One-sample Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test, t-test for independent samples, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test, t-test for dependent samples, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test, one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test, two-way ANOVA, Friedman test)Selecting the right statistical test (parametric and non-parametric tests)Example of a case study: Understanding the relationships between the determinants of the availability of healthy and sustainable food products in deprived areas: application of parametric and non-parametric testsUnderstanding the drivers of food and nutrition security as well as the evaluation of interventions to mitigate food insecurity, poverty, and malnutrition require the study of more complex sets of data than what association analysis can handle. It requires, among others, examining how a response/outcome variable depends on one or more predictors or explanatory variables. This type of multivariate analysis is widely used to infer causal relationships and carry out prediction and forecasting. Depending on the type of the response/outcome variable (e.g., continuous, binary, multinomial), a different set of statistical methods is used.In the remaining weeks of the course, students will learn quantitative tools that will allow them to understand causal relationships and make predictions and forecasting.Week 5 Â¿ Analysis of continuous outcomeThis lecture will cover the commonly used regression models to determine the strength and character of the causal relationship between a continuous outcome/response variable (e.g., caloric intake) and one or multiple explanatory variables (e.g., age, gender, income, palatability, health status).In this lecture, the students will gain knowledge on:Requirements for testing causalityRegression and causalityRegression fundamentalsManipulating variables in regressionSingle linear regression analysisMultiple linear regression analysisNon-linear regression analysisInterpretation and use of the analysis outputExample of a case study: Drivers of technology adoption for improved food security: application of multiple regression analysisWeek 6 Â¿ Analysis of binary outcomeIn this lecture, students will learn how to use the most commonly applied binary regression models to determine the strength and character of the effects on a binary outcome/response variable (e.g., household being poor) of one or multiple explanatory variables (e.g., widowhood, disability, illiteracy, low wages, household size).In particular, the students will gain knowledge on:Continuous versus binary regressionFundamentals of logistic regressionLogit model versus Probit modelSpecification and estimation of the Logit and Probit modelsInterpretation and use of the analysis outputExample of a case study: Determinants of MalawiansÂ¿ decision to buy safer milk: application of logistic regressionWeek 7 Â¿ Analysis of choice behaviour I:  assessing the drivers of individualsÂ¿ choicesUnderstanding and predicting the choice behaviour of decision-makers when choosing among discrete products/services (e.g., different interventions, different crop management strategies, different food products with different environmental and nutritional qualities) is crucial to design and implement strategies to improve food and nutrition security and promote more sustainable and healthier food production and consumption.In this lecture, the students will acquire knowledge on how to apply the commonly used behavioural choice models to determine the drivers of individualsÂ¿ choices and quantify their effect. This lecture will cover:Fundamentals of choice analysisBinary choice modelsMultinomial choice modelsSpecification and estimation of choice modelsInterpretation and use of the analysis outputExample of a case study: Access to food security by beneficiaries of cooperatives: application of a multinomial logit approachWeek 8 Â¿ Analysis of choice behaviour II:  assessing the heterogeneity  of individualsÂ¿ preferencesIn this lecture, students will be taught how to analyse and understand the heterogeneity of peopleÂ¿s choice behaviour and decision making, for example, the variation of choice behaviour across different socio-demographic groups of decision-makers. Assessing the heterogeneity of individualsÂ¿ choice behaviour is crucial if the outcome of the analysis is intended to help in designing effective policy and marketing strategies that are tailored to the needs of different stakeholder groups (e.g., rural consumers versus urban consumers, small farm holders vs. large farm holders). In this lecture, the students will learn about:Importance of analysing heterogeneityUse of the split-sample approachUse of the Interaction approachUse of the latent class modelInterpretation and use of the analysis outputExample of a case study: Kenyan farmersÂ¿ preferences and willingness to pay for the use of a new variety of drought-tolerant potatoes: application of the latent class modelWeek 9 Â¿ Behaviour change analysis: the role of attitudes and perceptionsIn addition to being influenced by socio-demographic and economic factors, peopleÂ¿s behaviour is also affected by their attitudes, perceptions and views. In this lecture, the students will learn about data analysis methods that are widely used to quantify the role played by stakeholdersÂ¿ attitudes, perceptions, and views in shaping their behaviour. This lecture will cover:Fundamentals of behaviour change analysisPath analysisExploratory factorial analysisConfirmatory factorial analysisExample of a case study: The role of social supermarkets in reducing food waste and food insecurity: application of confirmatory factorial analysisWeek 10 Â¿ Evaluation of food and nutrition programmes IIn this lecture, the students will learn how to use impact evaluation methods to assess the effectiveness of food security and nutrition-related programmes/interventions. The impact evaluation establishes whether the intervention/programme had a welfare effect on individuals, households, and communities and whether this effect can be attributed to the concerned intervention/programme. Impact evaluation serves both objectives of evaluation: lesson-learning and accountability, which, in turn, provide policy-relevant information for scaling up or redesigning existing programmes and designing future programs.The students will learn about the most widely used methods to evaluate the impact of food and nutrition programmes. This lecture will cover (more in the next lecture):Theory of change and measurementRandomisation methodPropensity score matching methodExample of a case study: Food and agricultural approaches to reducing malnutritionÂ¿application randomisation methodWeek 11 Â¿ Evaluation of food and nutrition programmes IIThis lecture is a continuation of the previous lecture (week 10). The students will gain knowledge on the use of other impact evaluation methods. In particular, the lecture will cover the following methods:Instrumental variables methodDifference-in-difference designRegression discontinuity designExample of a case study: The effect of income-supplementation on food insecurity - application of the difference-in-differences approach",

This programme is designed to equip students with the knowledge to work effectively in organisations seeking to promote sustainable development or improve environmental performance. The course is strongly interdisciplinary, providing the opportunity to integrate scientific, socio-economic and policy perspectives to gain a broad understanding of sustainability and how it can be achieved.The University defines the dissertation as an extended piece of scholarship in which students have the opportunity to study in some depth a topic (largely) of their own choosing. In practice, the subject will be chosen iteratively on the basis of studentsÂ¿ own interests, what relevant staff are able to supervise, and what is feasible given the literature and time available.",
    "course_description": "The dissertation should be distinct from earlier assessed work by the greater depth of comprehension and criticism demonstrated. Equally, of course, students are not expected to undertake the exhaustive scale of literature review or empirical work typical of a research degree. The dissertation may vary in the breadth of coverage. Since the time available for this work is short, it is not expected that the dissertation should report notable or original contributions to knowledge. The point is that it must have a clear focus with definable objectives and boundaries, achievable in the time and word length available.The exact format of the dissertation will vary from case to case depending on the work done. It may take the form of field work, an experiment, an opinion survey, a literature review, a management plan or any other exercise approved by the Programme Director. Its objective is to provide the student with an opportunity for demonstrating his or her competence in the chosen area of study.

The course will teach the student how to design and run a short-duration research project, how to synthesise data (their own and from the literature) into a set of coherent and defensible conclusions.The research project is aimed at developing technical, interpretation and reporting skills and encourage critical thinking. Integration of the concepts developed in the taught programme is facilitated through student centred investigations of current issues linked to a range of the Applied Environmental Hydrogeology applications. It is anticipated that the majority of students will be involved in the collection of new data, but that the range of the type of data will  be broad.The subject nature of the dissertation varies according to students interests. Generally, the dissertation must, at an appropriate level, demonstrate advanced knowledge and understanding in the field of study, relate knowledge of particular topics to the broader field(s) of the degree programme, and present such knowledge in a critical and scholarly way.",

Equally, of course, students are not expected to undertake the exhaustive scale of literature review or empirical work typical of a research degree. The dissertation may vary in the breadth of coverage. Since the time available for this work is short, it is not expected that the dissertation should report notable or original contributions to knowledge, but it is hoped that this may be an additional outcome. The point is that it must have a clear focus with definable objectives and boundaries, achievable in the time and word length available.The exact format of the dissertation will vary from case to case depending on the work done. It may take the form of a management report, field work, an experiment, an opinion survey, a literature review or any other exercise approved by the Programme Director.

Staff will also make the final judgements about the feasibility of project designs.  However, each iteration of Ecological Economics Field Methods in Research and Practice will involve a significant component of student-led learning. This is achieved through  a problem-based Learning (PBL) course structure that includes:1. Introduction to Problem/immersion in the relevant thematic area2. Team-based scoping of problem and research planning3. Engagement with the context where research is conducted4. Analysis and communication of resultsThrough this experience, students gain first-hand experience applying both the concepts and methodologies studied during the taught component of the MSc in the real world. The team-based element means students will acquire experience working in teams to a high degree of professionalism and with significant collective responsibility in a context relevant to their future employment. In turn, this gives students the opportunity to develop a wide range of transferable skills related to inter-personal dynamics, research, and project management that will be useful not only in their individual dissertations but in their careers post-graduation.",

    "summary": "Healthy soils contain millions of diverse living organisms, ranging from a myriad of invisible microbes, bacteria and fungi to macro-fauna such as earthworms and termites. Soils contain more living organisms in a tablespoon of soil than there are people on Earth with up to 90% of living organisms living or spend part of their lifecycle in soils. Soil is a living resource containing more than 25% of our plant's biodiversity. These diverse organisms interact with one another and with the various plants and animals in the ecosystem, forming a complex web of biological activity.Maintaining soil biodiversity for good soil health is vital for soil fertility, agricultural production and providing global food security. Soils contain approximately twice the amount of carbon than is currently contained in the atmosphere. Managing soil health can lead to the conservation of soil carbon pools and in some cases increase soil carbon sequestration, which can help offset greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to climate change mitigation. Soil organisms have the ability to break down certain contaminants mitigating against some forms of soil pollution.It is estimated that only 1% of soil microorganisms species are currently known compared to 80% of plant species. However, growing pressures from increasing global population, erosion and degradation and climate change are threatening soil biodiversity and soil health. In the Soil Ecology and Taxonomy course, we introduce you to soils and soil biodiversity in terms of the major participants involved in key soil processes, functions, fertility and overall soil health. In addition, the course discusses the challenges soils face in relation to degradation, pollution and intensification. The course will explore strategies to improve sustainable soil use to conserve soil biodiversity while maintaining functions and ecosystem services.",

We explore the ways in which ecosystem services can bevalued, measured and monetized by society, across the spectrum from intrinsic values (aesthetics, inspiration, cultural) to extractive (e.g. fisheries, forestry, mining). Both theoretical and practical applications of ecosystem valuation are explored through case studies of policies and projects, and case studies.Real-world examples of ecosystem services being valued will be examined, including payment for ecosystem services projects, biodiversity offsets,certification schemes and REDD+. Students have the opportunity to explore a case study in depth. The course concludes with a critique of the idea of valuing ecosystem services, looking at the importance of governance and power structures, the difficulties in valuing complex and unpredictableecosystems, and the trade-offs between efficiency and equity that often occur.",
    "course_description": "The course is organised into two distinctive blocks as follows:1.\tAn introduction to the ecosystem services concept. (weeks 1-4) This block is largely contextual. It involves critical reflection on the ecosystems services concept and explore its emergence in policy and management.2.\tExploring ecosystem service valuation to support policy. (weeks 4-8) Both social (non-monetary) and economic valuation and their links to policy instruments are explored in this block by reading the foundational literature and exploring themed case studies.Aside from the expected contributions to the weekly programme there are two coursework assignments (each of which is weighted at 50% of each student's final mark for the course).",

    "summary": "This course explores energy from the perspective of carbon emissions and their mitigation. We face an energy trilemma whereby we have to reconcile the security and reliability of the provision of energy, its cost and affordability and the environmental and social sustainability of generating electricity, fuels and heat. Trade-offs will have to be made between security, cost and sustainability, but what trade-offs are appropriate, desirable or at least acceptable?We examine energy supply and demand from technical, economic, social and political perspectives. From the supply perspective, we investigate the main traditional forms of electricity and heat generation, including traditional fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) unconventional fossil sources (shale gas and oil, tar sands), renewable energy sources (wind, solar PV, marine, biomass & biofuels, hydroelectric) and nuclear energy. Connecting supply and demand we explore the role of energy markets and infrastructure and how the electricity network is structured, managed and funded in order to ensure a high degree of system reliability. Through the prism of energy economics, we investigate how energy supply is costed, financed and paid-for and how market-based instruments have transformed the practice of electricity system organisation. We analyse how environmental and social costs have been included within the economics of energy provision and how this has and might in future change.Energy security in an increasingly interconnected world is evaluated. The phenomenon of energy poverty has social and political repercussions for energy policy and political reactions to carbon mitigation and is also covered. How the public think about and respond to energy-related topics is important in understanding deployment of energy generation options, responsiveness to demand-side management and political and policy responses to the energy trilemma and these issues will also be addressed during the course.",
    "course_description": "This course examines various energy related issues from a scientific, economic, social and political point of view. This course will investigate the benefits and downfalls of various energy sources including traditional fossil fuels, unconventional fossil sources, renewable energy, biomass, biofuel and nuclear energy.

    "summary": "Energy Systems & Technologies (EST) have co-evolved with human societies. Our day to day activities can be understood in practical, economic, and cultural terms (e.g.  working habits, commuting patterns, food cultures), but they are invariably and fundamentally underpinned by particular arrangements of EST. These arrangements may be stable for long periods, or may undergo rapid changes due to government policies, technological developments, market processes and other factors. The majority of our MSc students do not have the requisite background to fully appreciate the nature and role of EST in shaping societal, political and environmental outcomes. They often recognise the influence of EST on natural and human systems but lack   understanding of  the technical fundamentals that characterise  EST  in terms of material inputs, conversion processes, underpinning technologies, lifecycle characteristics, technical efficiencies, supporting infrastructures etc.  This course provides students with the conceptual and technical fundamentals of different EST, allowing them to:Identify and understand concepts and measurement units related to energy systems.Understand the fundamental technical and physical principles behind energy resources, and the operation of technologies to harvest them.Undertake key calculations  to broadly assess  energy outputs and energy economics for different technologies.Understand the historical background and development from different energy technologies and the drivers for change.Critically think about the complex nature of energy systems and their entanglement with wider social and natural systems.Students will engage in weekly group discussions based on pre-assigned readings and case studies. Students will also be provided with fortnightly group activities that allow them to assess their learning collectively and individually, and will have the opportunity to learn from two guest practitioners working with different EST. Finally, through the formal assignmentsÂ¿ students will develop key transferable skills including professional presentation, teamwork, report writing and analytical skills.",
    "course_description": "This course provides students with a fundamental understanding of EST by exploring the physical and technical principles of energy resources and the technologies used to harvest them. The course does so through a whole systems approach, beginning by exploring the different stages that integrate our energy systems (from extraction to waste), as well as the main energy related concepts and terms used for each stage (e.g. energy vs power; MWh vs MW). The final objective of such a systemic approach, beyond students becoming  familiar and knowledgeable on the scientific and technical fundamentals of energy technologies, is that they can understand and recognise the importance of energy systems as connected to wider social and natural systems. After a first lecture on energy systems and energy services the course will explore different energy technologies (e.g. solar PV, horizontal axis wind turbines, biomass, hydro power generation power plants and conventional fossil fuel power plants) starting from fundamental principles as well as historical development, market trends and most frequent social and environmental impacts. After exploring different energy technologies one lecture will be devoted to providing students with a basic understanding of concepts and calculations related to energy economics (e.g. CAPEX, OPEX, return of investment and LCOE). Finally, the students will receive a couple of lectures related to soft systems theory and case studies to develop their critical thinking on the social shaping of EST. These last two weeks will also provide them with the necessary tools to develop assignment two, a long academic essay to recognise and reflect upon the complex entanglement of EST with natural and human systems. The use of mathematics will be limited to basic manipulations of data and simple formulae.For each one of these weekly lectures the students can expect a wide range of hands-on, practice-based activities as well as discussion sessions based on course readings and talks from practitioners in the field.",

    "summary": "This course will provide students on the MSc in Environment & Development with a unique opportunity to experience and explore at first-hand theintersection of environment and development issues within the global South. Through on-campus lectures the course provides students with key research and methodological skills which are then put into practice during an off-campus field trip to Nepal*.Students will be introduced to the Nepali context during on-campus lectures and once there will meet with a range of people from government,development agencies, (I)NGOs, grassroots organisations, research institutions, and local communities. They will be introduced to projects, practices and processes related to issues such as water management, community forestry, adaptation to climate change, disaster management, and biodiversityconservation (exact topics and places may change year to year due to availability). Based on these initial interactions and insights, students will then design, develop and conduct small group research projects, facilitated by staff and in-country collaborators.*Field course locations may change for a variety of reasons, including security risks, increased costs or inability to access field locations. Any changes to the main destination of the field course will be announced as soon as possible*",
    "course_description": "NepalNepal offers a fascinating and unique context in which to explore the intersection of environmental management and international development. Despite its small size Nepal contains a huge variety of landscapes, habitats, biodiversity and people, from the glaciers and seasonal herders of the high Himalaya,to the forested Middle-Hills peopled by subsistence farmers, to the jungles and commercial agriculture of lowland Terai. Nepal is a hugely multicultural and multi-ethnic country, with 28 million people speaking between them 123 languages. Nepali society is based on a hierarchical caste-system, and whilstdiscrimination based on caste has been unlawful since the 1960s, caste and ethnicity remain the basis for continued and widespread marginalisation. Nepal has undergone huge political and constitutional shifts since the 1950s, moving from a Rana family autocracy, to harsh nationalism under the Panchayat regime, to multi-party democracy quickly followed by the 10 year long Maoist 'People's War', a Royal palace massacre, and finally theestablishment of Nepal as a secular, democratic, federal, republican state in 2008. Nepal is currently establishing a new federal structure, offering on-going opportunity for Nepal's development and people; particularly in light of the devastating 2015 earthquakes.Nepal is the 16th poorest country in the world and the second poorest in Asia (after Afghanistan), with 23% of the population living on less than $1.25 a day. High unemployment means that about 1,500 Nepalis migrate for work every day to countries such as the Gulf states, Malaysia and India. It comes as no surprise that Nepal has experienced intense attention from the international development community, interested not only in promoting economicdevelopment but in addressing social inequalities and governance. Given that most Nepalis live in rural areas and practice subsistence agriculture andland-based activities for a living, much international development work has an environmental focus, from agriculture in the face of climate change to water management and irrigation, from energy provision to disaster management, and from community forestry to protected area management andconservation. Urban populations are expanding rapidly, bringing additional challenges in cities and major towns; whilst out-migration from rural areas is altering the ways in which communities engage with their environments across rural Nepal. Endogenous civil society, social movements, scholars and activists are also hugely active across Nepal, although typically enjoy far less power and influence when brought together with international actors, whodominate negotiations, such as those over the operalisation of REDD+ in Nepal. The interplay of these Nepali environments and actors - from rural farmers and marginalised communities, to grassroots organisations and international agencies - along with their agendas, narratives and programmes of action, will provide students a fascinating case-study through which to understand more about the lived experiences, struggles and contradictions of environment and development in practice.",

It takes a critical perspective on mainstreamed approaches to sustainable development and explores alternatives that promote environmental and social justice. The course draws on current academic debate in considering the contested, political and ideological nature of environment anddevelopment issues. It views society and nature as inherently linked, historical contexts as highly relevant to current practices, and global capitalism and colonialism as underlying forces of change. Issues of access, justice, distributions of costs and benefits, power, and (in)equalities are foregrounded in our considerations, as are the roles and responsibilities of a range of actors (including state, international agencies and organisations, civil society, indigenous peoples and local communities, ourselves).The course aims not to teach students how to do environment/development work, but rather how to critically think about what it is thatenvironment/development work does, for whom, and with what consequences. It therefore focuses on the contribution of academic theory, critique and debate to on-going practices in environment and development. The course draws on scholarship in political ecology, feminist political ecology,environmental justice, nature-society geographies, and critical development studies. It promotes pluralist, decolonial and anti-racist approaches to environment and development, and promotes critical reflexivity on intersectional identities and positionalities of ourselves and others.",

    "summary": "In this course students conduct a hydrogeological environmental site assessment of a real field site with a hands-on project involving each phase of a typical site assessment (i.e., desktop, field, modelling investigations) with a specific focus on learning to integrate field- and modelling investigations to develop a holistic understanding of hydrogeological systems. The first part of the course students learn the environmental site assessment process and will conduct a desktop investigation of the project site. The second involves a mix of learning field measurement techniques and field-site visits to characterise the project site. Finally, students implement their collected field data into an industry-standard commercial groundwater modelling package, learn to use geostatistical methods to fill gaps in their field data and account for field-measurement uncertainties. At the end of this course students will present their environmental site assessments in a professional written report.",
    "course_description": "Provide an academic description, and outline of the content covered by the course and a description of the learning experience students can expect to get.While hydrogeology topics are often taught in isolation from one another, environmental site assessments and investigations require hydrogeologists to synthesize information from a broad range of topics and sources, including both field and modelling data. This is not straightforward as numerical models require precise information on the distribution of parameters across a site (e.g., permeability) yet field-investigations rely on techniques such as boreholes and pump-tests to produce point-source estimates of these parameters with large gaps between measurement points. As a result, synthesizing both field and modelling data to develop a holistic understanding of a groundwater system requires an understanding of their respective limitations and sources of uncertainties as well as the use of geostatistical techniques to interpolate between measurement points.In this course, students will conduct an environmental site assessment for a real field site. For this project, students will: 1) conduct a desktop investigation of the site, 2) go to the project field site and characterising the site with hands-on field methods, and 3) implement the collected data into an industry-standard software package to model groundwater behaviour at the site. In the first half of the course, specific focus is placed on learning field measurement techniques and gaining hands-on experience with them at the project field site to characterise the groundwater system. The second half teaches students: a) an industry-standard commercial modelling software package, b) how to implement their collected field data into the model, c) the use of geostatistical techniques to extrapolate the collected field data across the entire site, and then d) model the field site.  Students will then deliver a professional written environmental site assessment report including each phase of their investigation. During this process, students will learn how to critically evaluate field and numerical investigation techniques, and how to identify their limitations and sources of uncertainty.The course lectures develop studentsÂ¿ ability to synthesize knowledge and techniques learned from other courses into a single, comprehensive site investigation. Lectures are supported by hands-on practicals. The first part of the course, practicals have students visiting the field site and conducting their own field investigations. The second part of the course, practicals are focused on numerical modelling and report writing.The course will consist of 3 hour lectures each week, as well as hands-on laboratory and field practicals.Course outline:Unit 1: Desktop InvestigationIntroduction to the projectWhat is an environmental site assessment?How to conduct desktop investigationsUnit 2: Permeability and Borehole LogsWhat is a phase 2 investigation.

The methods covered are of direct relevance to policy formulation, ecosystem service valuation, and cost-benefit analysis, though students will be encouraged to pursue reading on the theme of most interest to them.By the end of the course, students will have insight into what economic valuation methods exist, the theory on which they rely, what form the data collected for these methods takes, and how data analysis can be conducted across a range of methods. This course will prepare students to pursue several paths, including each of the following: further development of environmental valuation skills; expansion of range for environmental valuation methods and approaches; ability to critically engage with the ethical and political limits of monetary valuation methods; an understanding of methods to elicit non-monetary values to guide policy and decision-making; and the development of dissertations featuring environmental valuation.",

Choice Experiments IIThis week will focus on the CE essay and the analysis of a CE dataset that will be the basis for the essay.Week 8. Benefits TransferIn this week students will learn about the pros and cons of different ways of conducting benefits transfer , conduct examples of simple transfers and be introduced to meta-analysis.Week 9: Putting monetary values in their placeThis week will 'zoom out' from a sole focus on monetary values to introduce the broader ethical orientations and values that underpin monetary values. In so doing, this week will challenge students to take a step back to re-examine the 'what' and 'why' of environmental valuation, introducing students to key values typologies and frameworks.Week 10: Practicing non-monetary valuationThis week will familiarise students with the range of methods and associated tools to carry out non-monetary valuations by paying attention to underlying rationalities that can frame methodological choices. Focusing on the 'how' students will learn how to navigate value pluralism and justify methodological choices when designing non-monetary valuation projects.Week 11:  Interventions in decision-making; environmental valuation in policy and planningThis week will offer reflection on the use of environmental valuation tools and outcomes for policy and planning practice. Students will critically explore 'how' and 'when' both monetary and non-monetary valuation methods can guide decision-making most effectively.",

    "summary": "This course explores the place of animals in contemporary food cultures. Growing awareness about the ecological footprint of livestock farming has brought animal-based food systems to the centre-stage of policy and civil society discussion globally. While environmental impacts, especially those related to carbon emissions and biodiversity loss, have had much recent attention, a number of other socio-cultural, public health, political and ethical issues also raise fundamental questions about the use of animals as and for food in todayÂ¿ss world.The sentience and experiential wellbeing of food animals, modalities for enhancing welfare; and the degree to which animal wellbeing matters in relation to other social demands have been some arenas of contestation. Another set of concerns lie in the domain of planetary health because of the ecological footprint of industrial animal farming, as well as its ties with zoonotic diseases, anti-microbial resistance, and lifestyle diseases. A third group of concerns are socio-cultural, and pertain to livelihoods, occupational health, and cultural traditions.The course will examine these political economic, ethical, and sociocultural dimensions of animal agriculture. It will do so by drawing on policy as well as scholarly literatures from a range of fields including more-than-human geographies, political philosophy, animal studies, animal welfare science, science studies, and public health. Intensive animal agriculture and its variations in the Global North and South will be a specific focus. Teaching-learning activities may include lectures, student-led discussions, seminars, quizzes, online research, and guest speakers. The wide array of materials and approaches deployed in the course will foster the skills required for critical engagement with animal agriculture and animal-source foods both in and beyond the classroom.",

Using GIS in health systems and policy is crucial for uncovering the spatial pattern of disease, analysing causative factors of disease, and informing policy and potential health interventions. Recent years have seen rapid growth in applications of GIS and spatial analysis in health research. This 'spatial turn' is in line with increasing availability of health related geospatial data and demands from public health authorities in health governance.This module aims to introduce theories, methods, and practical skills of GIS and spatial analysis in health and healthcare. It focuses on the application of GIS and spatial analysis techniques to quantitative epidemiological research questions and public health intelligence work. The role of GIS and spatial analysis will be introduced in the following analytical areas: the mapping of health data; analysis of spatial clustering in health events; measuring and modelling exposure to risk factors, evaluation of health inequalities, ecological analysis of risk factors, interpolation of health-related indicator and spatial access to health care and social care.

    "summary": "The course provides an overview of the basics of geology associated with geoenergy applications such as petroleum exploration, carbon storage or geothermal energy provision. The focus is on sedimentary rocks, in which almost all petroleum is located and where most geoenergy applications will occur.We start with the fundamentals: the three rock groups, the geological timescale, geological maps, the basic petroleum system as an analogue for CO2 storage and other geoenergy applications.

This course provides an introduction to the human dimensions of environmental change, recognising that these human dimensions are perceived and analysed in different ways, by different people.We will interrogate the human dimensions of environmental change through three analytical perspectives from foundational environmental social sciences: social-ecological systems theory, political ecology, and environmental economics. These different bodies of work would tend to diagnose different root causes of problems of environmental change, rely on different narrative interpretations of change, and ultimately prescribe different solutions. The course will consistently make use of these different lenses for analysis of a range of thematic environmental change challenges, and in doing so, will illuminate both theoretical and applied implications of these approaches. The themes we address in the course include: land use change, climate change and biodiversity change.The course allows students to develop a deeper understanding of the three approaches we use to understand the human dimensions of environmental change. In so doing, we invite students to critically engage with environmental change in the Anthropocene.The course is taught in an interactive manner in which student-led interrogation of the three analytical perspectives, and what they reveal about the human dimensions of environmental change, is key to achieving the learning outcomes.

    "course_description": "In understanding and managing environmental issues and problems, not only is a scientific understanding required, but increasingly also an understanding from alternate perspectives. This course will provide students with an opportunity to explore a range of alternate approaches, examine the nature of the evidence or output from these approaches, and integrate the different information sources together.The course starts with an introduction to the nature and importance of interdisciplinarity, and an exploration of the application to Â¿wicked problemsÂ¿. There are a series of sessions introducing students to different types of thinking, including critical (convergent) thinking, creative (divergent) thinking, and systems thinking.  There are also a number of sessions focusing on the perspectives and tools of different disciplines in relation to the environment, from art and psychology to economics and philosophy. Most of these sessions involve an expert guest speaker sharing their learning.Each session involves diverse pre-learning from listening to music to analysing papers, which will form the basis of plenary discussions. Each session also ends with group work, including debates, workshops and systems mapping. Throughout, students will consider the interconnections and differences between disciplines, the nature of thinking and evidence involved in different disciplines, and how these can be synthesised to provide solutions to complex environmental issues.An example course timetable is (please note this may vary year to year):-\tWhy interdisciplinary matters-\tA psychological approach to the environment-\tA philosophical approach to the environment-\tCreative thinking workshop-\tAn artistic approach to the environment-\tA legal approach to the environment-\tCritical thinking workshop-\tAn economic approach to the environment-\tA political approach to the environment-\tSystems thinking workshop",

After lectures on the basics of modelling, the course will be practical focussed, typically with a short introductory lecture followed by modelling exercises. A range of examples will be utilised (but including some repeat scenarios for implementation in different approaches). The final sessions introduce a range of topics, and will allow students to explore the different approaches as appropriate.1) Introduction to modelling 12) Introduction to modelling 2 and intro to OpenRefine for data management (practical)3) Modelling (simple risk models) and data summary using Excel (practical)4) Modelling using OpenModel 1 (practical)5) Modelling using OpenModel 2 (uncertainty analysis) (practical)6) Modelling using Simile (practical)7) Monte Carlo simulation and modelling for Carbon auditing (practical)8) Social network modelling using R (practical)9) Case studies- spatial modelling (practical)10) Case studies- predator-prey modelling (practical)11) Case studies- pollution modelling (practical)Please note that in light of possible COVID issues, the above topics are subject to change. Although the course can be run completely remotely, if possible we will have additional on-campus classes (repeated online).One of the aims of the course is to expose students to a variety of software tools (so students can judge how different tools may be better or worse in different situations, or can find out what tools they prefer to use). The teaching materials and practical sessions will use the following software:Â¿\tExcelÂ¿\tOpenModel (http://openmodel.info/) free for PC, if you have a Mac you will need Bootcamp (https://support.apple.com/en-gb/boot-camp) to installÂ¿\tSimile (https://www.simulistics.com/) free for PC, Mac and LinuxÂ¿\tR/R Studio (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) free for PC, Mac, Ubuntu etcÂ¿\tOpenRefine (https://openrefine.org/) free for PC, Mac and LinuxÂ¿\tHEC-RAS (https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras/) PC only (but as we use this software as a practical example of parameterising existing software to build a model, and not model building from scratch, this is the least essential download. I am working to get the class access to this software through SRUC virtual desktop though)Although teaching will focus on the above tools (primarily OpenModel and Simile), students are free to use any of the software as appropriate for their assessments if they wish (including software not included here, such as MatLab, or programming in Python etc).",

    "summary": "The world is facing a series of significant, inter-related sustainability problems that are, at their core, driven by the unsustainable use of environmental resources by humanity. These sustainability problems are 'wicked' in that they involve significant social complexity and inter-dependencies which make it difficult to envision and implement clear solutions. Even so, individuals have a role to play and there is significant scope for individual agency to play a part in solving these problems.However, it is not easy to figure out which choice amongst many competing alternatives is actually more sustainable, or how to best harness this agency at the level of the individual to effect change.The purpose of this course is to explore precisely these issues. The course adopts two Â¿lensesÂ¿ to explore this topic: that of individual behaviour change and that of complex systems. By applying both these lenses to sustainability problems of their choosing, students will explore both personally and academically what it means to live more sustainably.This course is heavily student-led and features experiential learning. The class is structured around a series of challenges, discussions, and training sessions through which the learning objectives of the course will be accomplished. This course will appeal most to students with high levels of intrinsic motivation to understand more about how to live a sustainable life, and requires of all students a willingness to engage in regular critical and reflective discussion in small and large groups, as well as substantive individual reflection.",
    "course_description": "There are three core 'elements' to this course: Communication Training, Sustainability Challenges, and a Sustainability Appraisal.Communication Training:This element of the course will progress in a series of 2-week 'units'. Each unit will involve students learning some principles of effective science communication and practicing applying those principles in the creation, and revision, of short communication pieces.The first unit will focus on core elements of narrative development and storytelling for science communication, and the mode of practice will focus on reflective writing and blogging.Subsequent units will focus on how to effectively communicate using a variety of other forms of media (e.g. infographics, pod casts, video shorts, and white board animations).For each unit, students will get 'technical'/ 'how-to' training as well as guidance on how to reflect core principles of science communication within the particular media of focus. To ensure this component of the course supports students in completing their final sustainability appraisal, the demonstration exercises students complete within each unit of communication training will require students to use each particular media form to communicate what they have most recently learned with regards to the sustainability of the products they are analysing in the sustainability proposal. Across the semester students will build up a clear understanding of the differing strengths and weaknesses of communicating their specific appraisal using the range of media covered in the course.The specific types of media in the course and their ordering will be made clear in the syllabus provided to students at the start of each iteration of the course.Sustainability Challenges:This element of the course will progress in a series of 4-week challenges. There will be a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 3 such challenges each semester. Each challenge will have the following schedule:Week 1: Collecting a baseline of current behaviourWeek 2: Living the challenge pre-interventionWeek 3: Living the challenge post-interventionWeek 4: Reading academic case studies & reflectionThe topics of the challenge (e.g. eating a low carbon diet), the number of challenges (i.e. 2 or 3), and the types of interventions experienced (e.g. information provision, nudging through triggering performance comparisons, social norm cultivation) will all be decided by the class by a vote in the beginning of the class.Students will be marked not on how well they manage the challenges, but on how deeply they engage with and reflect on what they have learned from the challenges about achieving behaviour change for sustainability. Through participation in these challenges students will explore their own agency for implementing change, the academic evidence base for the effectiveness of different kinds of interventions intended to achieve behaviour change, and the feasibility and appropriateness of devolving responsibility for change to the level of individuals.Sustainability Appraisal:This element of the course focuses on analysing a particular choice to determine which of two options is the more sustainable. This analysis starts in week 1 of the course, and will continue incrementally throughout the semester as students are introduced to the following:-\tDiffering conceptions of sustainability-\tSupply chains (including supply chain actors and resource bases)-\tEmbodied supply chain impacts (social and environmental)-\tUncertainty in relation to sustainability and product supply chains-\tConnecting the concept of system resilience to sustainability assessment-\tCore circular economy principles and how this may affect the interpretation of product supply chain sustainability-\tApproaches to synthesising across diverse forms of evidence to complete a multi-dimensional sustainability appraisalFor each of these areas, there will be a short lecture on key concepts, a specific task for students to complete in relation to the specific products they are analysing, discussion, reflection, and revision. By the end of the semester, students will have to present a completed sustainability appraisal, using one of the media forms taught in class.Learning Experience:Class time is used in this course for reflection, discussion, synthesis, training in communication techniques, giving/acting on constructive feedback, and introducing the next stage in the analysis required to complete the sustainability appraisal. The class focuses on student-led, experiential learning. Those students who invest appropriately and actively in this process will have significant opportunities to wrestle with the different facets of 'wicked' sustainability problems. They will gain academic knowledge (about sustainability appraisals and behaviour change), transferable skills (related to facilitation, communication, and feedback), and personal insights (related to the topic of personal agency and what it can accomplish).",

The course focuses students on developing evidence-based judgment in the context of complex issues as well.This course is intended to be an optional course open to all in the GeoSciences PGT community. It complements those courses that involve formal team work and applied methods training (e.g. PPP, AEE), and builds on a lot of the problems studied and systems studied in other courses in the school.

Academic theories and debates introduced in the first week of the course will provide the conceptual basis through which students can question and interpret the guest lecturersÂ¿ discussions of policy and practice.Alongside the guest lecture schedule, students undertake a semester-long group research project, synthesising the scientific evidence relating to a key issue in environmental management. This will involve identifying stakeholders, understanding the relevant policies and analysing the extent to which current practice is driven by and shapes policy. Students will identify their topic of interest, synthesise and analyse data, and will have regular opportunities for both formal and informal feedback from peers and staff.W1 Course introductions: understanding policy and practice; key theories and skillsW2: The role of data and evidence in environmental management; methods of evidence synthesis and introduction to group projectW3 Catchment-based integrated water and land management, rivers, partnership workingW4 Urban environments, community gardens, grassroots groupsW5 Nature conservation, designated sites, management for species and habitatsW6 Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) & carbon forestryW7 Farming, food, agri-environment schemes (CAP + Scottish Rural Development Programme), croftingW8 Marine protected areas, fisheries policies, campaigningW9 group project workW10 Group presentationsW11 Course conclusions: So what?

    "summary": "Marine (coastal and ocean) environments are fundamental features of the Earth system that are profoundly influenced by human interactions. As these ecosystems are trans-boundary and multi-dimensional, the policy instruments governing the utilization of coastal ocean systems are complex. However, policies, laws and regulations are often disconnected to the scale and dynamics of targeted ecosystems and species in both time and space (e.g. oceanographic processes, migratory species, multi-site life stages). Many global to local scale policies could be more effective, support deeper understanding of ecosystem processes, and take into account cumulative impacts of social pressures and environmental change. Additionally, as technology advances, human population increases, and energy demands extend the horizons of marine exploration and exploitation further offshore, understanding the connections between ecosystem dynamics and policies is increasingly vital.This course is focused on marine ecosystems, issues and policies in an integrated way that provides foundational learning for critical analysis of marine environments and human impacts. Diverse case studies across a range of biomes, scales, and issues are considered to examine and test the suitability of different policies for different ecosystem scales, environmental issues and socio-cultural contexts. Examples of case study scales include: Archipelagos and Islands, Estuaries, Semi-enclosed Seas, Continental Margins, Polar Seas, and Global Oceans. (Note: This course is co-taught as a 20c course for PGT students and for a small number of fourth year UG Env. GeoScience and Ecology students, with joint lecture sessions).",

    "summary": "MIEC builds on the Marine Systems and Policies (MSP) course taken in Term 1. MSP focused on marine ecosystems and the policies in place to conserve them, through the lens of the scientist and policy-maker across different marine biomes, policy scales and societal perspectives. In Term 2, MIEC examines the sustainability of ocean exploitation through the lens of the practitioner: students will explore different marine planning processes from around the world. Lecture-based learning based on five Â¿Blue GrowthÂ¿ sectors will take place. These are industries with high potential for socioeconomic growth in the future: aquaculture, renewable energy, seabed mining, maritime and coastal tourism, and blue biotechnology. Each Blue Growth lecture will follow with an expert-in practice lecture on real-world case studies of how a consenting and planning process was implemented that considered these Blue Growth sectors. Expert lectures will cover marine spatial planning, strategic environmental assessment, environmental impact assessment, marine wildlife codes of conduct, and access and benefit sharing of marine genetic resources. The goals are that by the end of MIEC, students will have the skills and breadth of knowledge needed to enter into a spectrum of practitioner roles, and to critically evaluate the robustness of marine planning processes being used worldwide in support of sustainable ocean development.Marine biodiversity, animal behaviour, habitat condition, and ecosystem connectivity have been significantly altered by ocean exploitation and development. Although the Â¿Blue EconomyÂ¿ of securing wealth from the oceans is luring, with 5 key marine Â¿Blue GrowthÂ¿ sectors having great potential for socioeconomic growth, we know that fisheries have radically transformed marine food webs and habitats worldwide, while touristic shorelines, wildlife watching, and aquaculture development illustrate a historic creep or Â¿ocean sprawlÂ¿ in our coastal zones. Advances in technology enable humankind to explore the ocean at unprecedented scales including discovery of molecular genetic resources, but technology enables exploitation of marine resources such as oil and gas resources and offshore wind in deeper more remote waters, with mining of deep-sea mineral resources on the worldÂ¿s horizon. The Blue Economy may also present new opportunities for marine conservation e.g., ecotourism and citizen science opportunities, benefits from drug discovery, or by the introduction of new habitats that help connect or sustain sharks, seabirds and marine mammals.The planning processes by which marine sectors are allowed to proceed is often isolated in space and time, unable to capture the incremental and cumulative picture of impacts, lacking in public participation, and not adaptive for climate change. MIEC students will learn about and critique various processes that take place nationally and internationally that strive for sustainable development of the ocean, including: Marine Spatial Planning, Strategic Environmental Assessment, Environmental Impact Assessment, Marine Wildlife Codes of Conduct, and Access and Benefit Sharing of Marine Genetic Resources. Delivered this way, MIEC integrates marine ecology, conservation, regulation and ocean governance against the backdrop of the Blue Economy.",

The course will enable students to understand the fundamental concepts and principles underlying a wide array of phytotechnologies (e.g., phytoremediation, phytomining, urban green infrastructure, etc.), as well as to identify their environmental and economic potential. Students will learn how different phytotechnologies can be employed to tackle air, water, and soil pollution in environmental backdrops ranging from mining sites to wetlands, and brownfields to urban canyons. Moreover, this course will provide first-hand instruction about the use of phytotechnologies for the economic exploitation of polluted or highly mineralised soils and their role against emerging contaminants. Hence, the students will develop the skills to critically discuss, design, and assess the implementation of phytotechnologies in specific environmental settings and contexts. In addition, experimental work (at bench and/or field-scale) covering the pertinent analytical methodology and key instrumentation, will allow students to link theory and practice. The course is suitable for students interested in the application of plant-based solutions to address a broad array of disciplines such as environmental pollution, green economy, and the natural capital, among others. The course encompasses lectures and tutorials/seminar sessions centred on activities to boost the studentsÂ¿ independent learner abilities.

In such a context, this course explores the problems and limitations of mainstream thinking about the politics of nature. In particular, this course is based on the understanding that the contemporary environmental crisis and associated politics are fundamentally intertwined with the pursuit of 'development' as a well-established, enduring goal across the world.As such, the course examines the complex intersections of the development project and mainstream environmentalism, focusing on implications for the wellbeing for people and nonhuman nature. This will include the critical analysis of key assumptions, concepts and interventions associated with conventional development and environmentalism. The importance of (i) scale (spatial, temporal, geopolitical and ontological), and (ii) of the connections  between the global and the local, and the structural and the individual, in understanding and addressing contemporary socio-ecological problematics will be recurring themes in the course.The course is primarily directed at evaluating established understandings of and approaches to environmental action, but also surveys alternative visions, approaches and practices that strive for greater socio-ecological equity. On the whole, the course will provide an empirically grounded and theoretically informed foundation for the critical analysis of and intervention in debates, policies and programmes relating to local and global environmental politics. Through the course, you will develop your own conceptual and political position on the politics of nature.",

    "course_description": "Remote sensing is the use of remote observations, often space-based observations, to make inferences about the state of Earth's varied environments. Space-based observations usually consist of measurements of electromagnetic (EM) radiation made by specialist sensors at times and locations constrained by the mechanics of satellite orbits. A wide variety of wavelengths of EM radiation are used, with different wavelengths imprinted with different information about Earth, and subject to different capabilities and limitations. New sensors and techniques are constantly being developed.To extract insight from remotely sensed data involves the techniques of retrieval (also known as: inversion, estimation) and image processing. In this course, students have the opportunity to use software to undertake simple retrieval and image processing, such as change detection, classification and some examples of digital filtering.There are many applications of remote sensing in the domains of environmental science, policy and treaty verification, military applications, meteorology, oceanography, agriculture and ecology. In this course, an overview of applications and techniques is provided.Any serious use of remotely sensed observations requires the user to be familiar with this wide range of knowledge, in order to select appropriate observations and use them with understanding.This course will consist of 10 four-hours combined lecture/tutorial/practical sessions. The typical format will be 1 hour lecture session followed by a 1 1/2 hour lecturer and demonstrator led tutorial and followed by 1 1/2 hour student led practical; however this is not a strict structure and it will vary. The theory and information provided in the lectures will be reinforced by the tutorials and applied by the students in the practicals. There will be mocked assessment during some practicals that students can use as formative feedback. The feedback can then be used to improve the components and these contribute to the final assessed assignment.",

    "summary": "The course is designed to identify and explore the principles that are widely recognised to form the core of sustainable development, and to investigate the extent of the environmental issues currently faced by society. It also aims to examine the underlying driving forces for environmental change, in terms of population growth, technological change, market economics and consumption patterns. The course encourages a strongly interdisciplinary approach to the understanding of sustainable development and seeks to foster critical thinking and debate.",
    "course_description": "1.\tIntroduction. What is sustainable development?In the first class the objectives, structure and approach of the course are outlined. We begin by briefly reviewing the rise of environmental concern since 1950. Some core principles of sustainable development are introduced, with an account of how they were elaborated through international policy processes.2. Conflicting worldviews of environment and developmentWe examine debates surrounding sustainable development and to consider what values and discourses underlies them. Disagreement can often be traced back to differing worldviews, particularly regarding forms of development and understandings of humanÂ¿s relationship to nature.3. Environmental limits and the sustainability principleWe examine whether there are environmental limits to the scale of the human economy. What evidence is there that limits are being approached and where do they lie? We will also consider other views in relation to nature including a conservation perspective in relation to the Â¿servicesÂ¿ provided by biodiversity and the arguments for its protection. Finally, we will focus on so-called Â¿safeÂ¿ and Â¿justÂ¿ operating spaces for humanity.4. Sustainability indicators and the integration principleWe consider the need to integrate decision-making in environmental, economic and social spheres to make development more sustainable. Integrated policy making requires information to monitor the state of society, economy and environment. We examine a range of sustainability indicators in national and international policy.5. Climate change and the precautionary principleWe consider the development and application of the precautionary principle, with a focus on climate change. What are the risks that humanity faces, and what level of precaution should be applied in attempts to manage them? We focus on the process of knowledge production involved in global change research, how knowledge is synthesised in the IPCC reports and how this is translated (and contested) into policy. Multiple solutions will be reviewed.6. NO CLASSMid-semester break for reading and reflection.7. Population, consumption and the equity principleWe examine the interplay between population trends and patterns of consumption in determining humanityÂ¿s impact on the biosphere. Evidence of the scale of current global inequity is reviewed. Why do intra- and inter-generational equity matter to sustainable development and how can they be ensured?8. The market and the polluter pays principleIn Northern industrialised economies, decisions about the allocation of resources have increasingly been left to market processes, yet these often lead to pollution and over-exploitation of natural resources. We consider how and why the market fails. The Â¿polluter paysÂ¿ principle allows some failures to be corrected. We also debate the role of economic growth in sustainable development. Is it a requirement or an impediment?9. Engaging communities and the participation principleProcesses of community participation in decisions that shape peopleÂ¿s lives are essential to sustainable development. We explore why, focusing on contemporary debates surrounding participation in just transitions in the UK and further afield.10. Justice and Transition to a Low-Carbon SocietyIn this penultimate session we focus on the question of justice and the transition towards a low-carbon or carbon neutral society. The transition to a low-carbon society will require significant changes to infrastructure, the economy, and social behaviours. We will consider how the principles might guide decisions about what a sustainable and just society should look like as we move from prevailing carbon-intensive industries towards low-carbon industries and practices. Building upon the equity and participation principles, we will explore the concepts of environmental justice and just transition. To ground this focus there will be a visit to the National Mining Museum of Scotland and the village of Newtongrange on the 19th of November.11. Envisioning a sustainable futureWe consider what a future sustainable society might look like. Will we live much as now, but with electric cars and renewable energy, or will society shift towards more localized and resilient ways of living, with reduced levels of consumption of energy and materials? How will the quality of our lives change? How might catastrophic futures be avoided? What can we gain and what might we lose? This class is a chance for students to explore possible pathways towards sustainability and their implications.",

    "course_description": "Each week, the course is split into three parts:Introductory lectures: Lectures cover the basic theory and provide a framework for applying and evaluating effective participation in decision making and conflict analysis.Learning from experience: Speakers from external organisations/groups are invited to present their professional experience and views on the extent to which participation can balance different interests.Group discussion and self-reflection: The class is split into small cohorts and required to engage in discussion (online or face to face, as appropriate) related to key readings and other material (e.g. podcasts/videos). There is also the opportunity for self-reflection on what students learn about their own professional practice as they move through the course.Weekly lectures and readings cover:1) Introduction to the course2) Conflict3) Values4) Power5) Representation6) Engaging the public in policymaking7) Engaging the public in planning8) Designing participatory processes9) Community action",

Students will have the opportunity to further develop critical analysis and communication skills that are transferable and valuable to non-academic organisations - from private industry to NGOs; to use an evidence-informed approach to evaluating key areas of carbon management; and ultimately to further our understanding of the world, with view to making recommendations on improving the status quo.The course covers three specific areas of research skills. Upon completion of the course, students should be able to:- Why we do research: critically analyse and synthesise existing knowledge via literature review and problematisation. Considerable emphasis will be placed on the value of research in furthering our understanding of the world.- Research Design: distinguish between the main design approaches that may be used to conduct research, and to understand when and why to use them. A select number of research methods are presented with opportunities to practice some methods. It should be noted the universe of potential methods for a Carbon Management dissertation is vast. We cannot possibly cover them all but will focus on developing an in depth understanding of the key approaches used by researchers in the field of carbon management.- Communication: tell a story in a compelling and robust manner that engages the target audience and details how we demonstrate a new contribution to knowledge and understanding. Weekly Tutorials are used as opportunities to develop and communicate our ideas.",

From Ecuador and Peru, to the United Kingdom and New Zealand, this course explores the cultural politics of grassroots activism around topics such as the climate emergency, the extraction of natural resources, and rights-based frameworks for the environment. Core Teaching on the course is divided into two segments. The first segment (weeks 1-6) is dedicated to learning relevant concepts and debates around social movements and the environment, where each week we apply a particular concept to a real-world case study. Concepts taught throughout this segment include Counter-Hegemony, Cultural Politics, Post-Materialism, The Environmentalism of the Poor, and Social Movements and Scale. The second segment (weeks 7-9) is dedicated to conducting a small-group research project on an environmental social movement of the groupÂ¿s choice. This will culminate in a group presentation to be delivered to the rest of the class in week 11.

    "summary": "Â¿In addition to sustaining 95% of food production, soils host more than a quarter of the planetÂ¿s biodiversity, are a major source of pharmaceuticals, and play a critical role in the carbon cycle. At the same time, the level of soil degradation (estimated at 33% globally) is alarming and has the potential to threaten food security and send many people into povertyÂ¿  Moujahed Achouri, Director of the FAO Land and Water Division.Healthy soils contain millions of diverse living organisms, ranging from a myriad of invisible microbes, bacteria and fungi to macro-fauna such as earthworms and termites. Soils contain more living organisms in a tablespoon of soil than there are people on Earth with up to 90% of living organisms living or spend part of their lifecycle in soils. Soil is a living resource containing more than 25% of our plantÂ¿s biodiversity. These diverse organisms interact with one another and with the various plants and animals in the ecosystem, forming a complex web of biological activity.Maintaining soil biodiversity for good soil health is vital for soil fertility, agricultural production and providing global food security.  Soils contain approximately twice the amount of carbon than is currently contained in the atmosphere. Managing soil health can lead to the conservation of soil carbon pools and in some cases increase soil carbon sequestration, which can help offset greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to climate change mitigation. Soil organisms have the ability to break down certain contaminants mitigating against some forms of soil pollution.It is estimated that only 1% of soil microorganisms species are currently known compared to 80% of plant species.  However, growing pressures from increasing global population, erosion and degradation and climate change are threatening soil biodiversity and soil health. In the Soil Ecology and Taxonomy course, we introduce you to soils and soil biodiversity in terms of the major participants involved in key soil processes, functions, fertility and overall soil health.  In addition, the course discusses the challenges soils face in relation to degradation, pollution and intensification. The course will explore strategies to improve sustainable soil use to conserve soil biodiversity while maintaining functions and ecosystem services.",

As such, the Soil Science Concepts and Applications module will provide students with a theoretical insight into soil science by looking at the biological, chemical and physical methods of analysis available to scientists, consultants and land managers. This theoretical delivery will be supported by both laboratory and field based practicalÂ¿s that allow the students to gain hands on experience in a range of methods, analysis and interpretation.The aim of the course is to provide students with a more rounded knowledge of soil analytical techniques and experiences. This should improve their potential employability within sectors interested in soil science. Additionally, the laboratory class aspects of the course will provide awareness of good laboratory practice, which should serve as a very transferable skill set as well as improve student readiness for dissertation laboratory and field work.",

The student selects a project that meets the pedagogical aims set out in the LO's of the SLICCs, while sitting within the subject area of the MSc programme and aligning with the programmatic LOs. The student develops an e-portfolio to provide evidence of their learning. Undertaking a SLICC enables the student to create a learning experience which is unique to them. This level 11 course requires students to demonstrate the development of their skills and understanding in terms of critical analysis, application, reflection, recognising and developing skills and mindsets, and evaluation within a defined context of their learning experience. This course will also enable students to demonstrate their ability to exercise autonomy and initiative at a professional level in their domain of studies.",
    "course_description": "A SLICC requires the student to propose, develop and manage a unique learning experience that will enable them to evidence how they have achieved the learning outcomes of the course. The self-designed learning experience is required to adhere to a defined structure that supports and enables the student to self-direct and manage their own learning experience. Within this structure however, there is flexibility regarding the topic or theme, content of study and nature of the students' experience, provided the proposal is: a) academically feasible given the available resources; b) consistent with the MSc programme LO's; c) approved by the SLICC tutor. A SLICC, for example, may be based upon a particular extra-curricular learning opportunity such as an internship, work experience, pro-bono activity, community engagement or volunteering, and may also focus on a theme of personal and /or professional interest such as sustainability, social responsibility, equality and cultural diversity, or a disciplinary or interdisciplinary-based research theme. The steps in undertaking a SLICC are as follows:1) The student identifies a suitable opportunity within which to undertake the learning experience, and attends a SLICC workshop; 2) The student writes the draft proposal and submits it to the tutor/advisor for approval; 3) The student self-directs and manages their own learning experience; 4) The student actively and regularly reflects upon and documents their own experience with evidence and uses that as a basis for writing their  'Interim Reflective Report', then their 'Final Reflective Report'; 5) The student undertakes a formative self-assessment of their work and submits their own 'Final Reflective Report' for summative assessment by their tutor. The steps identified above each require a significant amount of thought and input and will ultimately form part of a 'time-based' e-portfolio of evidence which will be used in the assessment of the SLICC.  The portfolio of output must furnish evidence of learning and should demonstrate how the student met the learning outcomes for the course.",

With guidance from an assigned academic tutor, this flexibility of choice enables the student, in the context of their own chosen experience, to focus on their  own particular skills and mindset.

Abundant knowledge has been gained from decades of hydrocarbon research, which can be applied to diverse future uses of geo-energy in the subsurface, for example the storage of variable supply from renewable energy has to match fluctuating consumer demand. Porous and permeable reservoirs aid climate control using carbon capture and storage; energy storage hydrogen and methane, or geothermal heat stores.",
    "course_description": "The first half of this course examines the science underpinning reservoir quality in sandstone and carbonate reservoirs. This is particularly relevant for hydrocarbon exploration and production, for CO2 storage sites, for energy storage as compressed air or as hydrogen or methane, and for groundwater aquifers. The mineralogy and physical arrangement of sedimentary grains is changed during burial by compaction, geochemical reactions, and fluid flow. That has a systematic impact on spaces between the grains, i.e. the porosity holding fluids, and permeability enabling flow of fluids. Course themes are divided into sandstones and carbonates. Each theme progresses from depositional and shallow burial effects, to processes during deeper burial. Shallow and deep burial (dis)similarities will be explained as will contrast and similarities between sandstones and carbonates.The second half of this course will focus on the large scale architecture of sandstone depositional units with sedimentary basins. A short lecture series will explain the different methods of recognising sedimentary subdivisions, and how stratigraphy is built up from deposition, to fossil time zones, radiomentric dats and seismic facies. A core-logging exercise is undertaken (normally in the BGS corestore in Edinburgh but may be in University if unavailable) will consider larger scale reservoir characteristics including net:gross ratio and the role of fluid baffles and barriers. Small groups present team seminars to the class on their selected topic, illustrating research or commercial applications.Teaching methodsDuring week 1-5 reservoir quality, before each meeting, students will pre-view recorded video lectures. These will be summarised rapidly in class by the lecturer, leading to small group discussion of topics and feedback to lecturer and class. This enables greater exploration of problem concepts and topics before and during the class meetings.  In week6-10 will be conventional lectures, a practical site visit to North Sea core archive, and team presentation of group seminars.",

The scale of our global UN Sustainable Development Goals requires a regular flow of new and innovative ideas and solutions designed to create positive impact for current and future generations. This course will provide an understanding of the contribution of academic theories and concepts and also a consideration of the developing practices of sustainable entrepreneurship. It considers the nature of sustainable entrepreneurship from a wide range of perspectives, examining how it can create value for consumers, society, the environment, and the economy. The course is practically orientated and encourages students to consider problems creatively and to identify, define, assess and communicate sustainable business opportunities, which are key entrepreneurship skills. This course does not aim to teach students how to start a business, but rather how to critically think about what sustainable approaches and business models are being developed, with what impacts. The course places the student within this context and challenges them to consider how they can personally identify and offer new and creative insights into solving sustainable development challenges through entrepreneurial practices.The lectures and activities will be based around the following key topics:1.\tIntroduction: To the course, assessments and the concepts and importance of entrepreneurship and sustainability.2.\tSustainable development through business: Sustainability on the agenda. Entrepreneurship through the lens of the UNSDGs. Review of changes and challenges. Opportunities for entrepreneurship and innovation.3.\tBusiness approaches for sustainability: Business approaches and models for sustainability.4.\tThe influence of stakeholders: Identification of key stakeholder groups.

Students will first learn to use data-driven approaches to gather baseline data to analyse spatial conflicts in the marine space using web-GIS platforms (no GIS experience necessary), and produce an issue brief. Students will also explore the governance and real-world practice of 3 different marine planning processes and associated marine policies meant to help achieve sustainable marine development: marine spatial planning, strategic environmental assessment, and environmental impact assessment. Students will learn about marine policies on transboundary environmental impacts such as the Espoo Convention, Kyiv Protocol and Convention on Migratory Species, and Habitats Regulation Assessments in marine protected areas as well as area-based management tools and how these help implement an EbA. Students will take part in round-table discussions of global case studies for peer-to-peer learning, with students critique these processes through different perspectives: e.g., climate change, small-scale fisheries, indigenous and local communities, scientific rigour, etc. Guest expert lectures from practitioners will help to reinforce theory and practice. Students will write a final essay-style blue paper that critiques a real-world case study of MSP, an SEA or an EIA. The goal is that by the end of the course, students will have the skills and breadth of knowledge needed to enter into a spectrum of practitioner roles, and to critically evaluate marine planning processes being used worldwide.",

Visual analytics is a methodology that brings together ideas of visualisation, user-interaction with data, and quantitative analytical techniques with the ambition of supporting analytical reasoning of geographic data. The course builds a foundation of knowledge in digital cartography and approaches to interactive visualisation. It introduces a set of quantitative data analysis techniques explored through a set of practicals. The creation of this course is in response to technological developments and more specifically to the emerging challenge of analysing and making sense of 'big data' sets in geography.",

There will be ten  1hour seminars over the semester. In seven  of the seminars, the lecturer will outline the key ideas for the next fortnights reading and have some discussion on the previous reading. These seminars will occur roughly fortnightly and be interspersed with four seminars organised as question and answer sessions, driven by student need. In these seminars the lecturer will help students with material that they have found difficult. Students are expected to spend 9 hours/week working through readings; doing problems etc.The course functions on the assumption that level 11 students are mature enough to be self-learners. So students will be expected, perhaps with some guidance, to seek out additional material and read some literature.To supplement the theoretical study practical training in how to run the Unified Model (or other climate models).

    "summary": "This course is aimed at Postgraduate Research students (MScR, MPhil and PhD). It provides training in research design necessary for students undertaking independent research at the postgraduate level in Human Geography and related areas of the humanities and social sciences. These skills are relevant to the proper management, execution and dissemination of advanced research. The course delivers training in a range of generic transferable skills, linking them to relevant research issues. The course also teaches students how to design research projects and the significance of considering a range of issues (practical, ethical and intellectual) relevant to successful research planning. Specific emphasis is given to the relationship between theory and empirical practice in research. Themes include: ontological questions relating to the human, spatial and environmental sciences; the role of fieldwork in geographical research; the ethics of research; researching across disciplines; the dissemination of research; the relevance of data management and data analysis. This work will be undertaken in a way that is responsive to the specific research interests of students undertaking the course.",
