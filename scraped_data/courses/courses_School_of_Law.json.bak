    "summary": "This course deals primarily with Roman Law and, secondarily with its influence on later legal systems, including Scots Law. It focuses on the history and sources of Roman Law, and a detailed account of the Roman law of persons, property, and obligations, before concluding with an overview of the 'Reception' of Roman Law, with a focus on Scotland. The course gives students experience of legal argument and classification, as well as an introduction to the phenomenon of legal development and the relationship of law and society, all within the context of one of the world's most important legal cultures. As well as providing a useful knowledge of Roman Law, the course provides a foundation to the study of the legal history of Scotland and Europe generally, and helps law students with future study of Scots contract, delict, and property law. It meets the Roman or Civil Law requirement for admission to the Faculty of Advocates in Scotland.No previous knowledge of either Latin or History is required for this course.",
    "course_description": "1) Roman (civil) Law or ius civile (the law applicable to Roman citizens) provides the foundation of the legal systems of most of the world and has been intensively studied since around 1100. It is the original university legal discipline and was the first law subject taught in Edinburgh University. By the end of the course, students should be familiar with the main sources of Roman Law, the Roman Law of Persons, Property and Obligations, and have a grasp of an overview of the impact of Roman Law from the Middle Ages onwards, with the ability to explain the law and it sources, and be familiar with the most important literature and debates, at a level appropriate for an ordinary-level student. They should be able to analyse texts. They should also appreciate the importance and problems of some classic and fundamental issues of legal classification. They should understand some of the fundamental structures of law, such as the institutional classification that underpins modern Scots private law. Students should also understand the significance of Roman law in European and World History, and more specifically in the history of Scots law. Where relevant comparisons are made with modern law and the Scottish Institutional Writers.2)\tThe course starts with a discussion of the sources of Roman law, an outline history of Roman law, and a discussion of roman procedure. It then focuses on the analysis of the concept of person in Roman Law, before dealing with the Roman family. It next examines the Roman law of property, exploring acquisition of property, and the nature of ownership and possession and the idea of a real right. The course then considers the fundamentally important Roman analysis of obligations, before considering Roman contracts, quasi-contracts, delicts and quasi-delicts, including pacts, innominate contracts and praetorian delicts. It concludes with an overview of the influence of Roman Law in Europe from the Middle Ages onwards, with special attention paid to Scotland.3)\tThe course is taught through formal lectures and small-group tutorials. There is a specific focus on the actual source material of Roman Law where feasible. There is a comprehensive course book with details of lectures and reading, as well as a tutorial booklet. Students also have access to a set of relevant texts for discussion and to promote understanding and learning.",

    "summary": "This course considers the doctrines and principles of criminal law, and examines the scope and function of criminal law in society. The course explores concepts in criminal responsibility (including mens rea and strict liability); specific offences (such as homicide, assault, sexual offences, offences of dishonesty, property offences, and public order offences); and defences (including mental disorder offences, provocation, necessity, and duress).",
    "course_description": "Through a combination of lectures and tutorials, students will be introduced to key concepts relating to the nature of crime and criminal responsibility. Following this, students will learn about specific offences (including homicide, assault, sexual offences, property offences and public order offences), defences (including provocation, mental disorder defences, self-defence, necessity and duress) and principles of criminal liability (including inchoate and derivative liability). The course aims to develop in students a sound understanding of each of these topics and the ability to apply this knowledge to factual scenarios. In addition, students will be encouraged to think critically about the criminal law and will therefore be expected to evaluate its doctrines and normative underpinnings.The indicative teaching programme for the course is as follows:-\tIntroduction to criminal law-\tThe scope of criminal law-\tActus reus and causation-\tMens rea-\tHomicide (including partial defences)-\tAssault-\tSexual offences-\tProperty offences-\tDefences-\tAuxiliary offencesThe course covers some sensitive material, which may impact on some students as a trigger in terms of previous experience. Announcements will be made at the start of the semester and before particular lectures cautioning students about the nature of the material addressed.Students will be assessed by an examination which will count for 100% of the overall course assessment.",

This will include, inter alia, classes on different critical methods, and the construction of persuasive arguments;-\tTo function as a bridge between Scottish Legal System in 1st year and Jurisprudence in 2nd, providing some important theoretical background and context to the technical issues and debates raised in the former, whilst introducing students to a range of the themes that they will go on to study in greater depth in the latter during the first semester of their 2nd year.",

The examination will consist of a multiple choice element, which will assess students' ability to apply legal rules to ascertain the admissibility of evidence in a given scenario, and an essay-based element which will assess students' ability to analyse critically the rules of evidence, and to reflect upon the normative bases of evidential rules.Students will be expected to read the relevant case law, statutes and secondary materials after class. They will also need to prepare for tutorials. This course covers some sensitive material related to sexual assault and child abuse and violence, which may impact on some students as a trigger in terms of previous experience. Where possible, announcements will be made before lectures, cautioning students about the nature of the material addressed.The indicative teaching programme for the course is as follows:- Introduction to the Philosophy of the Law Evidence & General Concepts- The Law of Evidence in Context: Criminal and Civil Litigation- Burdens & Standards of Proof- The Sufficiency of Evidence- Judicial Knowledge, Admissions and Presumptions- The Admissibility of Irregularly Obtained Real Evidence & Confession Evidence- Expert (Opinion) Evidence & the Skilled Witness- Character Evidence- Privilege & Immunity- Competence & Compellability of Witnesses- The impact of the ECHR on the Scots Law of Evidence- The Future Direction of the Scots law of Evidence",

It examines the challenges that global law presents for traditional legal theoretical accounts of legal systems, norms and methods. As such it will present both the positivist accounts of \u00c2\u00bfwhat is law\u00c2\u00bf and show how this is challenged. It will examine the different ontologies presumed by comparative law and legal pluralism. The latter part of the course looks at the concepts, such as power and empire, to understand the political, ethical, and ideological social systems that law is part of. Students will have a deeper understanding of all these topics which can be applied to the rest of the global law curriculum and further afield. The readings are complex and so close reading and challenging concepts will be taught slowly and deliberately. It will better prepare students in reading complex materials in Years 2-4 and in using relevant frameworks and discourses for themselves.",

Other regimes are explored such as (but not limited to) religious law, Indigenous laws and transnational private regulation. The course discusses the historical context and practices by which different regimes spread around the world, including exploring the colonial context and the ethical role of global lawyers as professionals who may transplant, compare, and codify knowledge in the careers. Students will learn about different approaches to law and how law contributes to the emergence of global structures for political, economic, and social life. The course will deepen students' understanding of legal pluralism, transplants and comparison and offer them the opportunity to think reflexively about the role of lawyers in participating in these practices.",

It seeks to problematize these categories and how they have been produced, at both a domestic and global perspective.The course first introduces the fundamental concepts of private and public law, such as rights and remedies, before examining some of the major regimes such as contract, property, administrative and constitutional law. These are important concepts and regimes for understanding law in a global context (and in ways that are developed and applied further in the likes of Global Jurisprudence, Jurisprudence and Global Law (Hons)). It will offer further depth and breadth of knowledge about law generally, building on initial thinking from law from year 1.The course will then examine these categories of public and private and explore how the boundaries between public and private are produced, relocated, and transgressed in the context of concrete global legal problems in the second semester. It explores whether globalization has contributed to questioning the boundaries between public and private and whether it has produced some of the rethinking and increased blurriness between regimes that seemed separated.",

It encourages students to think about how theoretical knowledge can be applied to contemporary issues of crime and its control, and to understand the socio-economic framework in which offending and criminal justice responses take place.The course is divided into ten sections which look at different aspects and levels of analysis and how they contribute to our understanding of offending and criminal justice:1. Thinking about crime and criminology2. Crime and the individual3. Crime and society4. Crime and inequality5.Crime and the city6.Crime and conformity7. Crime and criminalization8. Forgotten criminology?9.Knowing and not knowing about crime10. Explaining the contemporary world.There are two themed lectures each week, and a linked tutorial which takes place the following week. Tutorials are a central part of the teaching of the course and are where students are encouraged to apply the theoretical ideas introduced in the lectures to particular contemporary problems. Tutorial work is active, critical and discursive. Students may be asked, for example, to redesign a housing estate on the basis of criminological theory; create victim impact statements on behalf of victims marginalised by the criminal justice system, and advise the government on the introduction of new youth justice policy.",

These include questions about the relationship between law and morality such as whether we have a moral duty to obey the law (and, if so, why) and whether we need to engage in moral reasoning to determine the content of the law (and, if so, in what ways)? They also typically include questions about the relationship between law and: (i) language (exploring theories of legal interpretation); and (ii) adjudication (including how judges should and, sociologically, how they do, decide cases)",

A thorough understanding of these issues is vital to practitioners at a time of important constitutional change in Scotland and ongoing debates surrounding the best means of securing administrative justice. Therefore, the course is designed to have practical utility, but it will also involve the consideration of more theoretical issues.The course will be concerned with the study of judicial control of administrative action, the fundamental role in administrative adjudication conducted by tribunals and ombudsmen techniques, the law regulating the access to government-held information and the impact of EU law and human rights on administrative justice.The main emphasis will be on the law of Scotland, but English law and EU law will also be considered for comparative purposes, and occasionally other systems.",

Its main focus is therefore on asylum seekers, and legal processes involved in claiming asylum in the UK, with some reference to the EU. It examines the development of policy and law in the area with reference to key concepts such as internal relocation, persecution, and the Convention reasons that can ground a claim of persecution. In particular we will focus on the bureaucratic and legal hurdles that asylum seekers must surmount to become officially recognised as legitimate refugees in the UK, especially the problems of evidencing and proving credibility. This will include the observation of the operation of an asylum and immigration First Tier Tribunal in practice. The courses therefore will allow students to understand the theory, the policy and the practice of applying the UN Convention in the UK.",
    "course_description": "There will be 10 substantive sessions, taught by experts on asylum and refugee law from across the CHSS.

    "course_description": "Economic inequality has become a topical issue at different levels and from different perspectives in the last decades worldwide. Considering the financialisation of the UK economy and the evolution of banking law and regulation after the financial crisis of 2007-2008 guided progressively by public interest considerations, it would have been expected that banking law and regulation would have resulted in a few positive results and particularly in the decrease of economic inequality. Unfortunately, this has not yet been the case and an exploration of that area of law and regulation and its role and limitations towards creation and distribution of wealth is crucial. The objective of this course is to explore the role of the UK banking sector and its regulation in the increase of economic inequality. A multi- and interdisciplinary study will be employed with the aim to acquire a holistic understanding of the underlying driving forces of the relevant legal developments and their impact on economic equality providing the necessary context to proceed with their critical analysis and evaluation in the current UK context.Please find below an indicative list of topics which are to be covered through the seminar's course:Economic inequality and the role of law; Basic functions and role of banks and banking in the economy; The historical evolution of UK banking law and regulation; UK financial regulatory authorities: mandates and accountability; Access to banking services and activities; Quality of banking services and activities; Debt creation, collection, and enforcement; UK banking regulation: A micro-prudential perspective; UK banking regulation: A macro-prudential perspective; UK banking regulation: Privatisation of profits and socialisation of losses?",

Placing UK jurisdiction in the broader context of the international financial architecture, students are encouraged to engage with distributional and economic inequality issues created, transformed, or influenced by banking law and regulation at individual but also state level.Courage to expand and fulfil their potential:The course encourages students to place this field of law in the broader societal context and identify its role in one of the current societal challenges, namely economic inequality. In parallel, this course aims at providing students with the tools necessary to look for the distributional effects of law in general and the role of law in the current rise of economic inequality. Those tools are argued to be crucial not only in relation to their future professional roles but also their role as citizens.",

    "summary": "Through the globalisation of trade, businesses are confronted frequently with human rights issues. This course examines how principles of commercial law, the objectives of businesses, and the demands of human rights protection interact.",
    "course_description": "This course examines the intersection between (international) business and (international) human rights law. This course does not require any pre-existing knowledge of (international) human rights law or commercial law. The course focuses on how commercial law in the broadest sense can be used to find solutions for the complicated human rights issues that confront businesses.Traditionally, only states are subject to international human rights law obligations. States should therefore enact legislation that will protect human rights. This includes legislation to ensure companies respect human rights (which includes protecting the environment and workers\u00c2\u00bf rights.) If a state does not enact any legislation or does not enforce this legislation does this mean that companies do not have to respect human rights? There is a growing debate on whether companies have an obligation that is independent from the state to respect human rights. This is particularly relevant when considering the responsibilities of parent companies for subsidiaries and responsibilities for partners within the supply chain.The course approaches the subject area from an inclusive, diverse, and transnational perspective. The course aims to identify and critically deconstruct hierarchies in business & human rights. The course is not taught from the perspective of a particular jurisdiction and includes a variety of voices; especially those voices of the victims of corporate human rights violations. Their perspective often gets marginalised when it should be at the centre of the debate and policy making.The course analyses the growing international and national framework such as the 2011 United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and relevant national laws, including the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive, and the EU Sustainability Reporting Directive. The course draws on different areas of law including contract law, company law, and tort law to understand the actions businesses and civil society can take to further transparency and accountability for corporate human rights violations.In addition to exploring the theoretical foundations of business and human rights, the course helps students acquire the skills and tools to assess and address human rights risks in a business context. This includes the use of case studies, assessing National Action Plans, drafting contract clauses, and analysing corporate codes of conduct.The course provides students with a critical perspective on the challenges and limitations of business and human rights, including issues related to corporate accountability, transparency, and access to remedies.The course would cover:\u00c3\u0098\tThe role of business in promoting and protecting human rights: An examination of the impact of business activities on human rights and the responsibilities of businesses to respect human rights.\u00c3\u0098\tEthics and business: the ethical dimensions of business and human rights, including the role of corporate social responsibility.\u00c3\u0098\tThe Legal Framework: focusing on the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the emerging national legal framework on human rights due diligence.\u00c3\u0098\tCorporate accountability and access to remedy: the mechanisms for holding businesses accountable for human rights violations, including judicial and non-judicial mechanisms.\u00c3\u0098\tHuman rights due diligence, impact assessment, and risk management: the practices and tools for identifying and assessing human rights risks in business operations and supply chains.\u00c3\u0098\tThe role of contracts in furthering transparency and accountability in supply chain management.",

As well as looking at the development of the College of Justice in a comparative European context, the course will consider the development of a central criminal court. Other key institutions will be discussed and analyzed, notably the role of Parliament as court and legislature and it changing nature. The impact of these changes and their interrelationship with other courts in Scotland will be a major theme. The development of a legal profession as well as the impact of the ius commune and the Reception of civil law will also be reflected on, as will that of the Reformation on the law and ist institutions.",

    "summary": "Citizenship is a paradoxical legal and political concept: almost all of us have at least one citizenship (or nationality), but the basis on which we hold citizenship is often quite unclear to us. While most people obtain citizenship at birth through their parents, or through birth in a country, smaller numbers become citizens by naturalisation based on residence. Some countries put their citizenship on the market for investors to purchase like a luxury good. Others allow the descendants of those who left the country many generations before to become citizens, based on shared ethnicity. While states often regard citizenship as a strategic matter, we are also regularly asked to treat citizenship with some sort of reverence, as going to the heart of the state and its constitution.This course places the law of citizenship in its wider legal and political context. While the course will use the citizenship law of the United Kingdom as the baseline for study, there will be a strong comparative element, with examples drawn from right across the globe. Important elements of international law and human rights law are drawn into the discussion, alongside national constitutional law and political theory.",

    "summary": "\"Rome's greatest legacy to the modern world is undoubtedly its private law. Roman law forms the basis of all the legal systems of Western Europe with the exception of England (but not Scotland) and Scandinavia. Outside Europe, the law of places as diverse as Louisiana and Ceylon, Quebec and Japan, Ethiopia and South Africa, Turkey and Chile, is based firmly on Roman law. Even in England and the countries of Anglo- American law in general, the influence of Roman law is considerable and much greater than often admitted.\" - Alan Watson Roman law and comparative law (Georgia 1991) 3 ff. This quote by Alan Watson provides some indication of the true value and extent of the civilian influence in modern legal systems. Legal systems are too complex to be studied in detail, but by studying the historical principles on which European law is founded, the student will gain a unique insight into the working of civil-law systems. The aim of this course is to explain in depth some key aspects of early Roman Law, the various methods of law-making in the later Roman Republic and finally examine the development of the Roman Law on damage to property from the Twelve Tables (450 BC) until the time of Justinian (527 - 565 AD). By means of a detailed study of the original texts in translation it seeks to provide some understanding of the Roman - and by comparison the modern legal mind at work. Teaching will be based on primary materials with reference to extensive secondary literature. There is no particular prescribed textbook, but students will be required to do some research in the library.Students need not have taken Civil Law Ordinary and knowledge of Latin is not required.",

    "course_description": "The teaching of agricultural law, agricultural leases and land law at the University of Edinburgh Law School stretches back to the 1960s. This course will resurrect that heritage. It is an important course as there are many thousands of farm tenancies of various types in Scotland, as well as other occupancy arrangements, covering a wide variety of land types. This is therefore a relevant 'black letter law' subject.  There is also increasing interest in the use of rural land for carbon sequestration, commercial forestry and other 'natural capital enhancement' uses. In all of these areas, the law of leases plays a significant part and is likely to do so in future.The course complements the existing Commercial Leasing (Honours) course and runs in the opposite semester to that course. As such, a course like this would augment our leases offering and aspects of leasing not caught within 'commercial leasing', primarily in the non-urban parts of the country, but which nonetheless have a significant commercial focus. Furthermore, state intervention in the non-commercial leasing sector represented by the Agricultural Holdings legislation beginning in the 1880s forms an interesting example for study of such interventions for students whose aims are not so focussed on legal practice.",

    "summary": "This course provides an introduction to competition law, with a particular emphasis on the subject's economic aspects. It examines the economic theories and methods that underpin each area of competition law, as well as considering the broader influence that economics and economists exert on the field.",
    "course_description": "Taking in perspectives from the United Kingdom, European Union and United States, this course introduces students to competition law and the economics of competition law.Competition law is a vital tool in shaping markets, lowering prices, promoting innovation, and safeguarding the political and social realms from excesses of economic power. These issues are especially relevant today, with the dominance of the 'Big Tech' companies in digital markets, as well as other powerful companies across a range of industries. Given that competition law is an inherently interdisciplinary subject, with deep connections to economics, knowledge of economic theories and methods is critical to its study and practice.Each of the three major areas of competition law - anticompetitive agreements, abuse of dominance and merger control - are profoundly shaped by economics. Accordingly, competition authorities employ economists to develop theories of harm on which to build their cases. In turn, defendants hire economic consultants to rebuff such theories in court.The centrality of economics to competition law is highly contested. On one hand, it is praised in some quarters for bringing scientific rigour and objectivity to the field. On the other, with its focus on market-based solutions, it is often criticised for helping to create an enforcement environment that is overly deferential to corporate power.Given this context, the course provides students with an understanding of the substantive and procedural ways in which economics interacts with competition law, as well as an appreciation of the opportunities and challenges presented by the use of economic expertise in legal and regulatory settings.Methodologically, the course draws on mainstream competition law and economics, as well as critical insights from economic sociology and the law and political economy tradition. Although some equations and empirics may be used, the course is not mathematical.The course will cover the following topics:- The history and development of competition law (especially in the US, UK and EU)- Theories of economic competition- Central concepts in competition law analysis (market definition and market power)- Anticompetitive agreements (horizontal and vertical)- Abuse of dominance (exploitation and exclusion)- Mergers and merger control (horizontal, vertical and conglomerate)- Economic regulation (public utilities and digital)- The role of economics and economists in competition authorities and courts",

Both of these legal regimes have experienced rapid development in the 21st century. New medical innovations, greater international research collaborations, and the push for Big Data research and digitisation of society generate pertinent, complex questions about what ought to be done (if anything) with our personal (and patient) data, and under what legal and ethical conditions. As part of this exploration, brief consideration will also be given to a third related and emerging legal regime, namely a right of privacy in terms of the common law and the tort of misuse of private information. This course will enable students to explore some of the key concepts, rules, and functions of confidentiality and data protection/privacy laws as they operate in biomedicine. The central focus of the course is the interplay between UK data protection law, the common law duty of confidentiality, and wider frameworks in Europe and at the international level (including the Data Protection Act 2018, General Data Protection Regulation, European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence concerning Art. 8 ECHR, and Council of Europe and OECD data privacy frameworks). We will analyse and evaluate this interaction drawing on a range of sources, including case law, statute, policy, academic literature, advisory opinions, and domestic and international laws and practices.",

    "summary": "This course is designed to engage students with current live issues arising in the field of medical jurisprudence, being a disciplines which sits at the cross-roads between law, medicine and ethics, and which is concerned primarily with legal and social responses to advances in medicine, healthcare, science and related technologies.The course is deliberately designed to be open and responsive to issues that are current at the time of delivery in any given year. Accordingly, only broad indications as to topics and subject matter can be given is a description such as this. Likely issues to be covered include:(a)\tstart and end of life(b)\thuman genetics and biotechnologies(c)\tregulation of medical research(d)\thuman enhancement(e)\tgender identity at the intersection of law and medical practiceThe main aims of the course are:-\tTo equip students with deep and highly-responsive critical faculties to address medical and technical advances where the legal response is as yet under-developed or manifestly inadequate-\tTo expose students to cutting-edge research approaches in medical jurisprudence allied to the work of the School of Law and its Mason Institute in order to develop appropriate skills for a new generation of medical lawyers and ethicists-\tTo explore new ways of critiquing, understanding and shaping our legal and social responses to advance in medicine, healthcare, science and related technologies.",
    "course_description": "Given the deliberately open and responsive nature of this course, it would be inappropriate to attempt to give concrete topics. The topics will be chosen with the class in any given year under the oversight and direction of the course teachers. A broad indication of contemporary live topics will be introduced by the course teachers and it will be for students to decide amongst themselves which areas they would like to explore further. Suggestions and proposals will be invited from the students. Group interaction in this process will be encouraged and this will then be used as a means to take learning forward. Groups will be assisted to choose topics, develop materials, prepare to lead on seminar discussions, and to encourage mutual learning. The first few sessions will be led by staff as exemplars of the kinds of critical approaches and insights that can be explored. Skills development is central the course and will form an early part of the course interaction.Thus, the overall outline of the course will have the following format:Part 1: Skills development (Seminars 1-4)1. Introduction: the course, expectations, likely topics and group selection2. Final topics discussion and selection3. Discussion of preliminary course handouts from all groups3. Key skills development in critical thinking: staff-led seminar example4.Part 2: Exploring contemporary issues (Seminars 5-10)The latter half of this course will consist of the student-led group seminars.Expectations for each student-led ground seminar include:a. Group-led seminar based on student-prepared course handout and reading material to be distributed in advance (hence topic and group selection in Week 2 and reading material distributed in Week 3)b. Clear allocation of responsibility within the group for preparation and delivery of seminar (decided and managed by group)c. Full participation in discussion by all, encouraged through participation assessment via student blogs (x 4)d. Clear objectives and conclusions to be prepared by group",

More specifically, students will be guided through the arguments put forward in two of Cicero's most famous courtroom orations [Pro Tullio and Pro Caecina]. These will be contextualized by focusing on the state of the law, and the use of courtroom argumentation strategies to argue in favour of his clients. By means of a detailed study of the original texts in translation, it seeks to provide some understanding of the Roman - and, by comparison, the modern legal mind at work. Teaching will be based on primary materials and extensive secondary literature. There is no prescribed textbook, but students will be required to do some research in the library.",

    "summary": "This course examines how conceptions, definitions and practices of crime and punishment changed within Enlightenment Scotland, beginning in the late seventeenth century and concluding in the early nineteenth century. The course aims to provide students with a sense of how the criminal law in Scotland developed during a period of crucial intellectual, social and political change and to give a sense of how these changes fitted within the broader framework of what we might term 'the Enlightenment'.",
    "course_description": "The course will chart key developments across the period beginning in the late seventeenth century and concluding in the early nineteenth century through examination of, and critical engagement with, primary sources and secondary literature. in particular, it will trace changes in the definition and justification of particular crimes, and the criminal law as a whole, and consider how the contours of selected defences and the practices of punishment shifted. By situating these developments in their intellectual and social context, the course will encourage students to consider what might account for these changes. Although the main focus of the course is Scots law, comparisons with other jurisdictions (e.g. England) will be made where appropriate, and during the course of their study students will be introduced to legal theories and ideas that were not exclusive to Scotland.The course will include consideration of the following topics:- Fundamental issues, including sources, methodology and legal history as a discipline- The Enlightenment, law and legal thought- The scope, aims and sources of criminal law- Range of offences, such as: homicide and offences against the person; theft and property offences; 'sexual offences'; blasphemy, treason and sedition; witchcraft- Criminal prosecution, jurisdiction and trials- Criminal responsibility (and non-responsibility)- Punishment",

    "summary": "The course will introduce students to scholarship in and beyond criminology on atrocity crimes, which include war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. As such, the course is based in, and oriented towards, a social science approach to phenomena which are also defined in law.The first section of the course surveys the scholarship in criminology and a wider set of disciplines, and in relation to perpetrators and victims of atrocity. The second, short, section looks at the legal context of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the historical context of the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s. The remainder of the course develops a framework for further development of these approaches and issues through applied research on atrocity crimes in the former Yugoslavia. This section will include: a methodological session on using judicial sources as data; a methods session on using computer assisted qualitative data analysis software; and two workshop sessions linked to the final assessment. At key stages throughout the course, we reflect on ethical issues in research on atrocity, including archival research. Sessions 2 through 7 proceed largely through work in sub-groups, discussing core questions and presenting this back to the larger class.Ultimately, this course will equip students to conduct their own original analysis of data relating to atrocities, by utilising theory to interrogate empirical evidence.As the name of the course suggests, we will cover material which relates to interpersonal violence, which is extreme both quantitatively (widescale, systematic) and qualitatively (the nature of the violence inflicted). This includes scholarly accounts and direct witness testimony heard in court proceedings. It is normal for students to experience emotional reactions to this during preparation for seminars and while working towards the assessment. This will be addressed from the outset of the course, but students may also wish to consider this while making course selections.Students can find a detailed write up of the course in the Journal of Criminal Justice Education (https://doi.org/10.1080/10511253.2023.2205472).",

The course further takes a historical, theoretical, and comparative approach. It explores different conceptions of death and their legal consequences and examines the extent to which individuals can shape what happens after their death and influence the lives of those whom they leave behind.Students will thus study when human beings are dead for the purposes of the law but also ways in which law enables certain dimensions of the personhood of a person who is biologically dead to live on (including but not only through their digital presence).Students will further explore how far private autonomy reaches not just in determining their own afterlife (eg through decisions about posthumous procreation, organ donations, burial matters and the disposition of their estate), but also in determining the life of others (for instance through dead hand control). The course thus complements other courses, including those on the law of succession.",

    "course_description": "\"Rome's greatest legacy to the modern world is undoubtedly its private law. Roman law forms the basis of all the legal systems of Western Europe apart from England (but not Scotland) and Scandinavia. Outside Europe, the law of places as diverse as Louisiana and Ceylon, Quebec and Japan, Ethiopia and South Africa, and Turkey and Chile is based firmly on Roman law. Even in England and the countries of Anglo-American law in general, the influence of Roman law is considerable and much greater than often admitted.\" - Alan Watson Roman law and comparative law (Georgia 1991) 3 ff. This quote by Alan Watson provides some indication of the actual value and extent of civilian influence in modern legal systems. Legal systems are too complex to be studied in detail, but by studying the historical principles on which European law is founded, the student will gain a unique insight into the workings of civil law systems. By means of a detailed study of the original texts in translation, it seeks to provide some understanding of the Roman - and, by comparison, the modern legal mind at work. Teaching will be based on primary materials and extensive secondary literature. There is no prescribed textbook, but students will be required to do some research in the library.",

Criminal Law is a relatively new field of legislative activity for the European Union and deals mainly with challenges posed by cross-border crime. It harmonizes some areas of national criminal law but its main contribution is to develop a sophisticated suite of instruments to aid cross-border criminal law enforcement, including EU arrest warrants, investigation orders and transferring sentences. There are also EU policing and prosecutorial bodies and important databases. The course also addresses the interaction between criminal law and some other key areas of EU law such as free movement and data protection. Concerns with fundamental rights and state sovereignty are cross-cutting themes. The course will consist of a series of seminars analysing key areas of EU criminal law. Students will be required to read material in advance, both primary and secondary sources, and be prepared to discuss them in class. The class will be assessed by a moot court which will consist of a written submission and an oral hearing.",

Following a brief overview of the history and evolution of the EU as well as its institutional structure, the constitutional principles underpinning EU law will then be studied - principally: primacy, direct effect, and the EU's role in the protection of fundamental rights. EU free movement and internal market law will include in-depth analysis of the 'four freedoms' and the developing law on EU citizenship. A priority will be to identify cross-cutting themes - for example, understanding the principle of, and limits to, free movement - that apply over the different parts of the course.",
    "course_description": "The principal aim of the course is to develop knowledge and understanding of the constitutional and substantive elements of EU law, building upon and further developing the study of EU law to which students were introduced in the Ordinary course. Students should acquire an in-depth understanding of the Treaty on European Union and Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union; understand the division of competences between the EU and its Member States; be able to identify and understand the legal principles underpinning the application and operation of the EU Treaties; and be able to evaluate critically the application of substantive EU law.The course will cover the following issues:-\tNature, sources and primacy of EU law;-\tDirect Effect;-\tFundamental Rights;-\tJudicial Protection;-\tThe EU as International Actor;-\tThe internal market and free movement of goods;-\tEU Citizenship.The course will be taught in ten seminars addressing the issues referred to above. The course will be based on a high level of interaction, and students will gain an insight into the tenets of EU Law (with special attention being paid to the principle of free movement). The course is aimed at providing the students with deep knowledge of the centrepieces of EU Law, which will be acquired through the improvement of their analytical, synthesis and problems solving skills. Furthermore, their oral and presentation abilities will be tested. In order to assess the achievement of these goals, students will deliver a group presentation around mid-semester, and a written exam at the end of the semester.",

Building on previous study of EU law at Ordinary level, EU Law Honours I: Foundations focuses in more depth on legal issues that are particularly timely or unsettled. For example, what are the competences of the European Union and the Member States respectively? Why is the principle of the 'autonomy' of EU law, which distinguishes the EU legal system from both international and national law, so significant? What does the Charter of Fundamental Rights add to existing protection under the ECHR? What is the role of the European Union in crisis management? And (how) has Brexit changed the EU's constitutional and institutional 'ecosystem'?",

The course will discuss the theoretical conceptualisations of these rights, and how these different theoretical discussions have had an impact in the international and domestic protection of rights. This is also explored in the differences of the protections afforded by each regional human rights mechanism (through the Council of Europe, the African Union, and the Organisation of American States), as well as in different countries (Scotland, Colombia, South Africa, Germany, and beyond). In addition, the course will take an in depth look at selected economic, social and cultural rights. Students will explore the concepts, challenges, laws, policies and judicial cases that exist in relation to the right to food, housing, social security, among others. The course will end by challenging students to think beyond traditional understandings of the role of the state, critically reflecting on how business actors can also have an important impact in people\u00c2\u00bfs economic, social, and cultural rights.",

    "course_description": "This course begins with a medico-legal consideration of death itself, its definition, and its legal consequences. That will serve as a backdrop to a discussion of those deaths brought about by medical practitioners, euthanasia, and the involvement of the criminal law. Those two topics form the background to a consideration of those mental and physical states that predate death itself, and which make up much of the rest of the content of the course. It is based on the decision-making processes in law and in medical practice, that lead to death. We consider in some detail those medico-legal issues relevant to parental and judicial decision making in cases of medical futility or in circumstances of other prolonged disorders of consciousness in patients. There will also be scope for discussion of the decision-making process involving the legally competent patient, even although that process might have their death as its outcome. That will include topics such as advanced decision making under mental health legislation and conclude with a detailed discussion of suicide and assisted suicide, including the human rights based case for legislative reform in the UK jurisdictions. As the course will be seminar-based it will also be designed around discussion and debate, in which the class will be required to work in groups to present one or other set of arguments in favour of, or opposing, a set motion for debate. This will provide the opportunity to grapple with the material and be able to see and fully understand both sides of an argument. The same discussion and debate format will be used to effectively construct legislation in support of allowing assisted dying.",

    "summary": "The Freedom of Expression Law Clinic provides a unique opportunity for students at Edinburgh Law School to work alongside practicing lawyers on international casework. The perspective of the course is both analytical and practical and the key objective is to afford students the opportunity to apply their knowledge of substantive law to a real client case. In so doing, students will be exposed to ethical-social values instrumental to the practice of law and reflect on the relevant social, political and economic context of legal casework.The clinic will specifically address cases of violation of Freedom of Expression and human rights violations against journalists. The Clinic is a collaboration between Edinburgh Law School and the international NGO Media Legal Defence Initiative based in London. Traditional academic teaching will be complemented by clinical supervision from experienced practitioners both within the law school and with the partner organisations. Throughout the course, students will work towards draft submissions to the United Nations Special Procedures Mechanisms, notably the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.",
    "course_description": "The weekly sessions will typically consist of two parts, approximately 50 minutes long each. These will combine both theoretical academic lectures and clinical supervision, allowing for follow up on the lectures and group work on cases.The course will be available to a selected group of 12 students, which will allow dedicated and personalised clinical supervision. The students will be split into smaller groups and each will work towards drafting a submission for a different case. While the academic lectures and the general clinical supervision will be common to both the groups, the supervision on the draft submission will be personalised and group-specific.The course will include two main parts: an academic and a clinical component,  which, although mutually reinforcing, will deliver different but intertwined programmes. Throughout the course, the academic and clinical component will provide the students with a unique set of substantial knowledge about freedom of expression and the regulation of newsgathering activities in a comparative perspective, on the one hand, and practical and usable skills relevant to their future professions, as well as first-hand experience in drafting submissions to the UN Special Rapporteur and working on human rights cases.Throughout the seminars the course will cover academic topics such as:- Introduction to the Legal Mechanisms for the Protection of Human Rights.- Legal theories of Freedom of Expression.- Human Rights in action and the three-part test.- Freedom of Expression in the ICCPR and in the UN Human Rights Mechanisms.- Freedom of Expression in a comparative perspective: the ECHR, the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights, the African Convention on Human and Peoples' Rights.- Legal protections for journalists and media operators in a comparative perspective.- The scope of journalistic privileges and shield laws: the case of bloggers and citizen journalism.- Data protection and the case of whistleblowers.- Hate speech.- The right to privacy.- The legal background of the cases: substantive questions and issues arising from the work-in-progress on the draft submissions.The clinical component may cover the following topics:- Introduction to clinical legal education and professional identity.- The role of NGOs in international advocacy and casework.- Presentation of the Freedom of Expression Law Clinic, allocation of research and writing exercise and timeline of deliverables.- Introduction to reflective journal writing.- Legal research and case theory - exploration of case theory and allocation of cases to students.- Case management - how to maintain case files, preparation of case outline and legal work plan.- Case investigation - evidence gathering, legal research and drafting the skeleton submission.- Client handling - client consent and first draft of the submission.- Feedback on draft submissions and preparation of final drafts.",

The course will be an advanced introduction to contemporary comparative constitutional law and applied constitutional theory, and will engage with particular themes and issues emerging in these fields. In particular, the course will examine: the theory and practice of constitution-making; comparative constitutional design; models of liberal and non-liberal constitutionalism; forms of government including parliamentarism, presidentialism, and hybrid forms; and the constitutional accommodation of societal pluralism. At the end of the course, students would have gained a solid grounding in the methods of comparative constitutional law, a good awareness of some of its major current substantive and theoretical concerns and debates, and perhaps equally importantly, an opportunity to understand the practice of constitutionalism in empirical contexts very different to those of the UK and Scotland.",
    "course_description": "In recent decades the comparative approach to studying constitutional law has become a major and perhaps even a dominant method in the field. It has generated a very substantial literature and the course reading will reflect many of the central texts. Adopting this comparative approach, students will be expected to develop a sophisticated sense of how to read relevant primary materials, such as constitutions, primary and secondary legislation, and key political documents such as peace agreements. They will also be expected to develop the ability to engage with demanding secondary texts dealing with substantive constitutional law, theoretical work that helps us to understand constitutionalism in context, and literature from relevant related disciplines like comparative politics, political sociology, constitutional history, and political economy. Through consideration of major themes, they will have the opportunity to consider how these play out in distinctive political, social, economic, and cultural contexts of countries in different regions of the world.The course will be seminar-based with a 2-hour seminar every week. Students will be given listed readings based upon current developments. They will be expected to discuss these in class.",

Because the UK rules are drawn directly from EU law, which was itself part of our law until January 2021 and will continue to influence, directly and indirectly, UK law, there will continue to be significant consideration of the relevant EU sources, principles and practices, with additional comparison to other competition laws (primarily American and German) as appropriate. Central topics for analysis include:- basic economics of competition law: 'the marriage of law and economics';- the notion of 'restriction of competition' generally and in relation to the most important types of restraints among undertakings;- the concept of collusion, express or tacit, among competitors;- the notion of abuse of market power;- the enforcement of the Competition rules in the EU and in the UK, through administrative, judicial and criminal means.",

Types of markets; the concept of consumer welfare; market power; schools of antitrust.- The purpose of competition law in EU and UK law.- The scope of the jurisdiction of, respectively, EU and UK competition laws.- 'The Chapter I prohibition': the prohibition of cartels: the elements; agreements and concerted practices; horizontal and vertical restraints; the rule of reason; the role and purpose of the 'exemption clauses'.- 'The Chapter II prohibition': abuse of a dominant position. Definition of relevant market; dominance; forms of abusive conduct; joint dominance and oligopolistic markets.- Enforcement of competition law: the nature and structure of competition proceedings; the role and powers of the European Commission and of the Competition and Markets Authority; judicial control of both; civil remedies; criminal enforcement; the continuing application of EU law in the UK.",

It considers the motivations that underpin gifts and whether, and if so how, these motivations are reflected in the law. It examines different legal conceptions of gifts and gift promises across the common and civil law legal traditions and explores how gifts relate to various areas of the law.As the title reveals, the aim of this course is to put gifts into context and to study them through the lens of such contexts. The course is structured into two parts. The first part explores how insights from other disciplines (eg anthropology, sociology, psychology and economics) can enrich our understanding of gifts, as well as the legal challenges that gifts pose and how the law 'controls' gifts. The second part explores what can be given and how and the role that both the donor's but also the donee's intention play. It further explores whether gifts can be revoked and or be reduced and what that tells us about how law sees gifts.The course is interdisciplinary, historical, and comparative. It is also multi-jurisdictional, drawing on examples from both the common and civil law legal tradition.",

    "summary": "In order to understand environmental law in today's world, it is indispensable to broaden the perspectives far beyond the national legal orders. Natural resources are interconnected and so are national markets. Therefore, the level of environmental protection ensured in one's territory does not depend solely on national law anymore. In practice, the level of protection is determined by the interactions between international, European and national environmental laws as well as by the interactions between environmental, trade and human right laws. This course will give students the opportunity to understand how these interactions influence the ambition and the effectiveness of environmental and health protection, using the concept of 'global environmental law' as the point of entry.The concept of global environmental law refers to 'a field of law that is international, national and transnational in character all at once' (R.V. Percival, T. Yang). In order to grasp this concept and its manifestations, EU environmental law will be used as a starting point throughout the semester. Indeed, it perfectly exemplifies the dependence, cross-fertilisations and conflicts between national, regional and international levels as well as between environmental law and other branches of law - trade, development, investment, agriculture, and human rights which also have a huge impact on the level of environmental protection.By studying the national and international significance of EU environmental law, students will acquire a concrete grip on the 'Global Environmental Law' concept, which encompasses the most interesting and the most recent evolutions of environmental law.",
    "course_description": "By studying the national and international significance of EU environmental law, students will acquire a concrete grip on the 'Global Environmental Law' concept, which encompasses the most interesting and the most recent evolutions of environmental law. To do so, the course will first explore the actors of global environmental law. It will then analyse the sources of global environmental law. The multitude of sources will logically lead us to assess the coherence of global environmental law. Finally, the last seminars will be dedicated to the evaluation of the biggest challenge faced by global environmental law today: the reduction of the compliance gap.All these issues will be analysed through case studies unveiling major pieces of EU and International environmental law. The Case studies will cover the right to a healthy environment, the Climate regime at International and EU level, the regulation of genetically modified organism, of dangerous chemical as well as the protection of biodiversity.In addition to the course organiser, guest practitioners and academics will teach some seminars and therefore bring their experience to the class.The course is taught by means of seminars. Reading lists are supplied for each seminar in a separate handout, which will be made available in advance of the seminar. At each seminar the course organiser will make a brief presentation on the topic which will then be followed by a general discussion or smaller group exercises. Each week students will be called upon to discuss particular issues covered in the reading list. All students are expected to participate in the discussion.",

Some understanding of Roman law is also useful but not essential.The course will involve the use of case law, legislation, and secondary literature in order to understand key developments in these topics. The focus of the course is not deep doctrinal understanding, but an appreciation of the relationship between law and history through the medium of particular legal developments.

The course will examine the difficulties and controversies in enforcing civil and political rights, socio-economic rights and group rights, respectively. The course will also examine specialist regimes such as those relating to women, children, national minorities and indigenous peoples. Each topic will be approached so as to provide an overview of the topic and contextual examination of the practical difficulties of enforcing rights by focusing on how a particular human rights abuse has been addressed in practice. Finally, the course will cover current controversies in human rights law such as how to deal with 'transitional justice', or the debate over a bill of rights in the UK context. The course aims to be useful to those interested in human rights and legal practice, but also to human rights advocacy in a non-governmental setting, and for those interested in rights issues more generally.",
    "course_description": "This course aims to develop a detailed knowledge and an in-depth understanding of domestic, regional and international human rights law and how it interconnects in practice. In addition, it aims to develop an appreciation and understanding of the limitations of the framework of human rights law and to introduce students to controversies in the application of rights.  Further, the course aims to develop a student's ability to handle legal materials and to apply the basic principles of human rights law to hypothetical problems.The course focuses on four main areas:Semester 1:I International Human Rights LawThis section of the course will introduce the concept of human rights and critiques of it.  It will consider the main international and regional human rights treaties, looking at each through a practical application to a human rights problem (invented or actual).II Generations of Rights?In this section of the course we will examine arguments that there are different 'generations' of rights.  We will examine the differences and similarities between civil and political rights, socio-economic and cultural rights, and group rights.  However, the discussion will involve looking at a particular rights struggle, and reinforcing understanding of how the mechanisms examined in section I of the course operate in practice.Semester 2III Bringing Rights Home: Scotland, UK and ECHRIn this section of the course we will examine the relationship between international and regional human rights standards and the Scottish and UK context.  This section will build on work in PLUS and PLAIR, and on the work undertaken in Semester I.IV Current Issues (topics to be confirmed closer to the time)Throughout the course, human rights achievements, and sadly new forms of abuse, will continue to unfold.  We will continue to keep a watching brief on these, and take advice from, and draw on the interests of those on the course, to respond to these by offering classes dealing with them.he course objectives are:-\tTo introduce students to the building blocks of the domestic, regional and international systems of human rights-\tTo illustrate the interconnections between domestic, regional and international enforcement of human rights-\tTo illustrate the operation of the European Convention on Human Rights, making sure that students can work with its case law-\tTo illustrate the main mechanisms of protection and promotion of human rights in the United Kingdom and in Scotland in particular-\tTo demonstrate the relationship of international human rights law to other international legal regimes, such as humanitarian law and international criminal law-\tTo enable students to use human rights law to respond to practical examples of violations of rights-\tTo encourage students to engage critically with human rights law-\tTo encourage students to engage with current controversies regarding human rights-\tTo build students transferable skills in practical reasoning from within the subjectStudents will be expected to develop a sophisticated sense of how to read relevant primary materials as well as the ability to engage with demanding secondary texts.  Students will be expected to apply materials to hypothetical and real life scenarios.",

    "summary": "Against the background caused by regular crises and the economic globalisation of trade, businesses increasingly face economic and financial difficulties. This course examines principles and causes underpinning business failure, as well as the procedures available to assist struggling businesses. This is particularly relevant at a time when insolvencies are at their highest since 2008/2009.",
    "course_description": "This course examines the causes behind business failure, the policy objectives behind insolvency law, as well as the concrete insolvency and rescue procedures available to businesses experiencing financial difficulties in the UK.This course does not require any pre-existing knowledge of corporate insolvency law. Basic knowledge of company law (business entities) and commercial law (ordinary) will prove useful but not essential.This course espouses the evolution of the corporate insolvency law landscape in the UK over the last 40 years. It starts with an examination of the evolution of insolvency law in early years, from punitive sanctions to the second chance policy in place today.The course focuses on core concepts and principles of corporate insolvency, such as the evolution and rationales of the concept of insolvency and the law; the sources, definitions and objectives of insolvency law; the causes of corporate failure; the creditor/debtor relationship; and the liquidation/rescue dichotomy. It also engages with selected issues of European, international, and cross-border insolvency law and the position of the United Kingdom on the international insolvency scene.These topics are of particular relevance:(i) at a time when insolvencies are at their highest since 2008/2009; (ii) at a time where the position of the United Kingdom, until recently heralded as the 'Delaware of Europe' for insolvency, is challenged.In addition to exploring the theoretical foundations of insolvency law, the course helps students acquire the skills and tools to assess and address insolvency law issues in an applied context. This will be done mostly by adopting a law in book versus law in action narrative throughout the course. Current and topical insolvency cases will be discussed, alongside statistics and policy briefs from the Insolvency Service and Companies House. This will provide students with a critical perspective on the challenges and limitations of insolvency laws and policies, including issues related to the success of rescue procedures.The module builds on knowledge acquired through previous courses such as Business Entities, Contract Law, and Commercial Law (Ord) (although having studied these courses is not a prerequisite for learning corporate insolvency law) and will help students to develop commercial awareness by enabling them to apply both practice informed, as well as reform-oriented problem-solving techniques to concrete legal issues arising in insolvency cases. Students will thus develop a critical appreciation of the regulation and practice of corporate insolvency law and insight into how to assist struggling companies to recover from their financial difficulties, through the use of formal and informal insolvency mechanisms.",

    "summary": "This course is aimed at giving students a working knowledge of the framework and dynamics of international civil and commercial litigation. The course will consider many of the issues that will need to be addressed by companies and individuals when faced with litigation involving cross-border elements. The approach to the regulation of cross-border disputes varies in different jurisdictions and the questions of which court has jurisdiction to hear a case and which law will be applied to the determination of that case depend to a large extent on which set of rules results applicable to the case. This course will consider international, regional and national approaches in relation to questions of jurisdiction, applicable law and international judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters. It will provide an opportunity to visualise how some key aspects of international litigation work in practice in some of the most popular judicial systems with vast expertise in international civil and commercial litigation, such as England. Hence, this course is not limited to the study of international civil and commercial litigation in the Scottish courts but provides a window into the practice of international litigation in popular hubs for international legal practice.",
    "course_description": "The course aims to develop the students\u00c2\u00bf knowledge and understanding of the legal instruments applicable to the determination of civil and commercial jurisdiction, applicable law in contract and delict, the nuances of multi-party disputes in the international civil and commercial context, and the ingenuity of international legal practice in different jurisdictions to manage the challenges posed by legal diversity in this context. Additionally, the course aims to raise the students\u00c2\u00bf awareness of the increasing internationalisation of legal practice and when appropriate consider alternative approaches to these matters from different jurisdictions.Participants in the course will be able to study the following core topics:1.\tThe Dynamics of Cross-Border Litigation1.1.\tLitigation in the wider context of dispute resolution mechanisms1.2.\tPrimary issues informing the process of resolving cross-border disputes1.3.\tProcedural justice and procedural efficiency2.\tJurisdiction in Civil and Commercial Litigation2.1.\tWhat is jurisdiction in this context?2.2.\tConflicts of jurisdiction2.3.\tThe European Regime of Jurisdiction in Civil and Commercial Matters3.\tA different approach to Jurisdiction: The English Traditional Rules3.1.\tService in the jurisdiction3.2.\tService out of the jurisdiction4.\tChoice of Law4.1.\tIntroduction to choice of law4.2.\tWhy apply foreign law?4.3.\tChoice of law in contract4.4.\tChoice of law in delict4.5.\tContractual rights and property interests: the situs of debts in international private law5.\tParty Autonomy in International Litigation5.1.\tChoice of court agreements5.2.\tChoice of law clauses5.3.\tAsymmetric agreements5.4.\tLimitations to party autonomy and weaker parties6.\tMulti-party disputes6.1.

The students will be required to undertake reading in advance of the seminars and at times apply the legal rules to previously given problem scenarios.  Students will also be expected to give short presentations on specific issues in a number of seminars. By the end of the course students should be able to demonstrate an understanding of the basics of international civil and commercial litigation including jurisdiction and applicable law rules regarding contracts and delict in the EU; a good knowledge of legal doctrines and devices crafted to suit the needs of international litigation, covering procedural aspects; and the ability to understand the practice of international litigation in the wider context of international commercial dispute resolution mechanisms available to private parties within the civil and commercial context.",

Two main perspectives will be considered: on the one hand, the course will critical assess the growing role that the private sector and tech companies in particular (especially digital platforms) play as global regulators and standard-setters, and what are the consequences of such shift on the governance of fundamental rights. On the other hand, the course will discuss, at a more granular level, the impact of digital technologies on a selection of specific human rights such as the right to freedom of expression, privacy, welfare rights, etc.",
    "course_description": "The course will explore how the increasing power of global technology companies and the widespread uptake of emerging technologies, such as for instance digital platforms and artificial intelligence, impact on the enjoyment and protection of human rights. As stressed by the Council of Europe, \u00c2\u00bf[n]ot only does [the emergence of digital technologies] require us to acquire a deeper  understanding of their impact on the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, but it also entails careful consideration of questions concerning where responsibility should lie for their adverse consequences.\u00c2\u00bf The course thus aims to critically engage with such emerging questions while at the same time considering the possible opportunities and advantages offered by technological development to the cause of human rights. Alongside broader considerations, regarding the specificities of \u00c2\u00bfdigital\u00c2\u00bf human rights and the impact of technology on the governance thereof, the course will look in detail at specific fundamental rights and their interplay with digital technologies.  While regional (Council of Europe, EU) and international perspectives will be the main focus of the course, national models from a comparative perspective will be occasionally considered when relevant. The course aims to offer a wide yet detailed overview of the impact of technological development and the rise of digital platforms and automated technologies on human rights. Its main objectives are as follows:   \u00c2\u00bf\tTo provide an in-depth understanding of the emerging relations between digital technologies and human rights at the international and European level;                                                            \u00c2\u00bf\tTo develop an in-depth understanding of the normative and social challenges of regulating technologies, and the different methods and techniques that make it possible (e.g. self-regulation, co-regulation, regulation by design, etc.);                                               \u00c2\u00bf\tTo develop a critical understanding and analytical capability in respect of technological advancements and their impact on the society.",

    "summary": "This course will examine the rules governing intellectual property at the international level mainly from a legal perspective. However, policy and institutional perspectives will also be considered. Crucially, the course aims to train students to think critically about intellectual property within the context of international law. In this regard, the international rules for the protection of different types of intellectual property rights (such as copyright, patent rights, and trademarks) will be critically examined. Moreover, the international institutions where these rules are made and administered (such as the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the World Trade Organisation) will also be considered. Importantly, a major theme that will run through the entire course is a critical examination of the policy space available to states under international intellectual property law. Furthermore, apart from studying some of the key treaties and cases in the field of international intellectual property law, students will also critically examine the interface between international intellectual property law and other areas of international law such as international trade law and international investment law.The course is therefore aimed at enabling students to:1.\tUnderstand the most important aspects of treaties dealing with intellectual property rights2.\tCritically analyse the policy space available to states under international intellectual property law; and3.\tComprehend the interface between international intellectual property law and other areas of international law",

    "summary": "International Investment Law has become a very important area of public international law and extremely popular among young practitioners and academics. As states strive to attract foreign investment as a driver for development, the law of investment protection has evolved through, both: i) the negotiation of some 3000 international investment agreements (IIAs) currently concluded, and ii) the development of its unique dispute settlement mechanism, investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS). However, after a backlash against ISDS and the legitimacy of IIAs, international investment law is currently going through profound changes and reforms. This course provides an introduction and general overview to these two aspects of international investment law. It starts with a general overview of the investment regime and its public and private divide. It then addresses procedural and substantive provisions of IIAs. Students will consider the main standards of protection incorporated in IIAs, most-favoured national treatment, national treatment, fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security and expropriation with compensation. Through the analysis of different IIAs and the reflection on the decisions of arbitral tribunals, students are expected to discuss the adequacy of investment provisions vis a vis states' regulatory freedom. The course ends with a discussion of the legitimacy and efficacy of the investment regime, and an assessment of the reforms proposed.",
    "course_description": "The course progresses in content and complexity as student get acquainted with this area of law. The instructor will provide reading materials for preparation of the class, but as the course develops students will be expected to find additional sources and share them in class.The basic content of the course includes:- Historical introduction to international investment law- International Investment Agreements (including bilateral investment treaties (BITs), multilateral investment treaties (MITs) and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs)).- Investor-State dispute settlement- Standards of treatment in international investment law- Expropriation- An assessment of the legitimacy and efficacy of the investment protection regime.",

What is the relationship of law to morality? Do we have an independent duty to obey law? Should all moral imperatives become legal imperatives? And where do the ideas of morality and justice that affect our understanding of law come from? On what basis can they be justified? Is legal neutrality a desirable \u00c2\u00bf or even an intelligible \u00c2\u00bf goal?The course will consist of three elements (any two of which may be stressed in a given year); the nature of moral values and their relevance to law (whether providing an intrinsic element of law, or a critical standard for its appraisal); theories of justice with special reference to legal problems; ethics in the legal process.",
    "course_description": "The course is divided into 5 sections. In the first, essentially introductory, section we will familiarise ourselves with some important terms and distinctions, discuss one of the classic texts addressing the relationship of law to morality (Sophocles\u00c2\u00bf Antigone), and consider the question of whether and when we have a moral duty to obey the law. The next two sections are devoted to examinations of different approaches to questions of morality and justice: firstly some important historical figures, representing major schools (Aristotle, Kant, Bentham/Mill and Marx) and then some more contemporary scholars (with a focus on Rawls, Habermas and Foucault).In second semester, we will then turn our attention to some relevant conceptual controversies, relating to human rights, a duty to rescue, torture, and mercy. We will then conclude by considering whether and how the various theories and positions we have studied in relation to justice, ethics and law can be applied in a global setting.This course is delivered in a seminar format, as this is by far the most effective way of developing the skills outlined above.",

In particular, it asks how law contributes both to the 'who' and the 'how' of political community.  In what ways is the construction of legal and constitutional order at different sites important  to  the various different levels of political community formation  in the contemporary world - the state, the sub-state nation or region, the supranational (e.g. EU) and even the international or global? How, more generally, does law help to generate, or impede, understandings and practices of citizenship, or 'membership', and how does it encourage, or impede, democratic decision-making, more generally? Behind these questions lie even more general and deeper questions about the contemporary role of law and its relationship to politics. One the one hand, is law better able to reflect and convey some models of political community (e.g. liberal models) and the ideas of citizenship and democracy associated with these, than it can others (e.g. socialist or other communitarian models)?  On the other hand, does the increasing dispersal of law to sites other than the traditional state site place a new and perhaps unmanageable burden upon law in general in the formation and legitimation of political community?There are a number of possible affinities and synergies between this course and other Honours options - including Constitutional Law and Justice, Ethics and the Law",

    "course_description": "The course will consider the background to the 'feudalization' of Scotland, reflecting on Celtic institutions and their survival, before considering such 'feudalization' in the light of the work of Reynolds and MacQueen. The introduction of Anglo-Norman institutions and structures of government will be assessed, reflecting on their impact on the law, and how they moved to create a Scots common law. Consideration will be given to royal courts, baronial, and feudal courts, Parliament and the impact of the English Conquest and the Wars on Independence, as well as on the role of the Church and its laws. Students will understand why feudal tenures and structures were introduced, how they were introduced, and their impact on Scottish society and Scots law, developing a critical understanding of and insight into the origins of Scottish law and governmental practice in the later middle ages.",

This course is highly relevant in today's world and recognises the importance of expanding and developing knowledge and understanding of mental health issues and the application of mental health law. The main aim of the course is to examine the development of mental health law and how it is applied to related conditions that arise throughout the spectrum of life, beginning with diagnosis of conditions through early years, childhood, adolescence, adulthood and senior years.  As well as examining specific legislation, the course (to a lesser extent) will focus on: changing societal attitudes to mental health and the growing recognition that mental health is as important as physical health; an in-depth investigation into the well-documented increase in the incidence of diagnosed mental health conditions in teenagers and its possible link to the global increase in the use of social media; and the ways in which society can maintain the positive momentum that has gathered over recent years.  It should be noted that the basis of this course lies in the law and legislation; it does not seek to focus on medical diagnosis or treatment for mental health conditions.",
    "course_description": "This course offers students, who may have no knowledge of mental health law, a worthwhile opportunity to build up knowledge, understanding and expertise in this area of growing interest and importance.  By the end of the course, students will have gained a high level of critical understanding of the subject area and will competently be able to apply their knowledge to scenarios that may arise at any point throughout the human lifespan.The course will be structured in such a way that it will track the chronological development of the human lifespan, focussing on important issues such as legal definitions of mental incapacity, the giving of informed consent by children and adults, emergency detention and short-term detention in hospital, consequences for education and employment, and power of attorney.  Throughout the course, reference will be made to current mental health statutes and their applicability.Students will be expected to prepare for and take part in each seminar by completing the necessary reading and research.  This course will make use whole class discussions as well as small group discussions of case studies.  These will help to give students a sense of personal involvement in the outcomes.",

    "summary": "Money is an all-pervasive legal concept, and an integral part of public dealings by the state and most private transactions. It tends, however, to be poorly understood by lawyers, who often assume that money is a \"given\", the meaning and operation of which is determined by economists, with the law having very little part to play. This course seeks to dispel that impression.The course aims to develop a distinctive understanding of the legal institution of money, seen from private-law and legal-historical perspectives. Although drawing on historical and economic sources, it emphasises the distinctness of legal conceptions of money from those applied in other related academic disciplines. It draws on source material from civil law and common law jurisdictions.By a course of guided reading and seminar participation, students will become familiar with the public and private law regulation of: monetary issue and creation; the payment and discharge of monetary obligations; the analysis of money as a species of property; the enforcement of currency judgments; and legal responses to new monetary developments such as cyber-currencies.",
    "course_description": "Students will learn how the formation of monetary law follows from a long historical interaction between legal doctrines and innovations by commercial and financial actors in creating new kinds of payment media. Students will be expected to read independently and across a wide range of source materials to form their own views about the meaning of monetary legal doctrines in the context of other disciplines which influence its development.The outline content of the course will be as follows:- The legal institution of money, as related to and distinct from economic conceptions of money.- The sovereign power of the state in the issue of legal tender money, and the legal relationships between state-issued currencies and privately-created money.- A legal history of the UK monetary system, including an historical analysis of obligations for the payment of money in Scots law and common law.- Money as a species of private property, including the treatment of money as fungible property, and of mixtures of money.- The legal effect of payments of money, and proprietary effect of money transfers.- Contemporary innovations in the use of money, especially in the development of cyber-currencies.- The enforcement of currency judgments in private law.Student learning experience:The course will be taught by a series of 10 2-hour seminars, for which students will be provided with in advance with reading lists, and questions to guide their development of ideas. Active participation in seminar discussions will be encouraged. The course will emphasise the connection of ideas across a range of legal doctrinal and non-legal reading sources.",

Its primary focus is upon Scots law, but extensive comparative reference will also made to Anglo-American and European legal systems. Fundamental conceptual structures will be studied in their historical and modern contexts and consideration will be given also to the broader factors, circumstances, and values that inform a finding of liability in negligence. The course will have at its centre a review of the fundamental framework of duty of care, standard of care, causation, and defences. It will also give attention to topical problem areas such as liability for negligently inflicted economic loss and for psychiatric injury, and well as the liability of public authorities. Future directions in Scots law will be mapped against English law and discussed in the light of developments such as the 'bringing home' of human rights law to delict and recent initiatives to establish a common European law of torts.The course has the following primary aims:A. To develop knowledge and understanding of the Scots law of negligence in comparative context.B. In so doing, to develop abilities and skills in respect of:- Using legal materials- Practical reasoning- Appreciation of the law in its social, economic and historical contexts- Evaluation and criticism of the law- Research, gaining knowledge and understanding which may be applied and adapted in future; and transferable skills, including (a) oral and written communication skills; (b) intellectual skills, of collecting, organising, evaluating, synthesising and presenting material and arguments, including the questioning of assumptions and testing of hypotheses; and (c) general skills, in managing time, working independently, and taking responsibility for one's own work.Indicative topics to be covered are as follows:- Introduction: the evolution of the law of negligence and convergence with English Law- Duty of care- Standard of care- Causation- Defences- Liability for psychiatric harm- Liability for pure economic loss- Liability of public authorities- Negligent nuisance- Vicarious liability",

Students will acquire a basic background in neuroscience and the ability to critically evaluate claims made about the potential of this research to change the administration of justice. Analysing the actual or proposed use of neuroscience in legal contexts, ranging from fMRI as a device for lie detection to questions of our understanding of traditional legal concepts such as intent and responsibility. The course will discuss both descriptive questions \u00c2\u00bf can neuroscience change the way we evaluate the credibility of a witness, the neutrality of a juror, or the clam of a victim to be in pain? Secondly, it will look at the normative dimension, and analyse if there are ethical, legal or regulatory objections that can be raised against the use of neuroscience in the justice system. The second main theme of this course is the regulatory issues raised by neuroscience. The aim is to gain a sound understanding of the existing legal regulatory framework of neuroscience, and then to systematically explore if legal change is needed to maximise the benefits and minimise the dangers of this scientific paradigm. This will include the regulation of its use in legal settings such as the law of evidence, but also suggested uses outside the law that raise legal issues such as brain enhancement technologies, neuroadvertising and manipulation of memory.",

Students will also be encouraged to reflect on (i) whether the domain of private law can be said to be a unity (in particular in view of the crucial distinction between the law of obligations and the law of property) and, if so, (ii) what brings those elements together. Students will also be encouraged to reflect on the implications of those conceptions of private law to law\u00c2\u00bfs development and to the interpretation of positive law (with a specific focus on examples drawn from individual legal systems, in particular Scots law).Those general themes will provide the framework within which students will reflect on many different attempts to justify specific aspects of private law, such as Locke's justification of private property (later developed by Nozick), Hegel's justification of private property, Weinrib's conception of how contracts relate to corrective justice, and the economic analysis of the law of delict.",

    "course_description": "The aim of this course is to provide students with the intellectual tools necessary to construct arguments based on civilian authority in a court of law. In doing so, the course will take a thoroughly practical approach, focusing across a number of seminars on specific instances in which arguments using civilian authority have been employed in a court of law as well as the opportunities and pitfalls associated with an approach of this kind. Students will be exposed to the sources associated with this type of argument, the intellectual merit of such arguments as well as their place within the larger narratives of the 'sources' of a legal system. Finally, issues of accuracy and 'movable texts' in historical sources will be addressed.This course will consist of an introduction followed by nine seminars focusing on specific court decisions in which civilian authority have been employed. Students will be asked to do reading in advance, to dissect the argument employed and to investigate the sources used in order to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the overall argument. This will be used as a backdrop for discussion of specific issues such as when an historical argument should be employed, how to do so, what sources to use and what pitfalls to avoid.Each seminar will be centred around a specific case. In each instance, a reading list will be provided. Students will be asked to analyse the arguments raised in each case, to assess the sources employed and to comment on the accuracy of the use of historical sources. This will be distilled into a position paper of 10 minutes that will be presented in class. At the start of each seminar, a student will be selected at random to present their position paper. Class members will be encourage to comment on the paper delivered, thereby providing a vehicle for seminar discussion.Please note that classes for this course will be jointly taught with Masters level students.

In their teams, students will be presented with a number of simulated but realistic scenarios each involving behaviour that is anti-social and/or criminal. Using the principles addressed in the induction students will be given 2 RJ scenarios which will require them to assess the suitability of, conduct and evaluate a variety of RJ approaches including conferencing. The course will be front-loaded with a day-long induction (or two half-days if preferable) for students.We will work closely with statutory bodies and other organisations in the not for profit sector some of whom have already expressed interest in collaboration, particularly the Social Work Department of the University and the Justice Directorate of the Scottish Government and their access to justice and youth offending teams. The relevant legal knowledge examined is likely to overlap with or otherwise complement studies elsewhere in the undergraduate programme providing a unique opportunity for students to apply legal relevant principles - for example demonstrating their understanding of criminal law and procedure, philosophy of punishment and human rights.Subject to accreditation requirements of the Restorative Justice Council (and/or a similar body currently under discussion for Scotland) students (and those interested persons outside the University) may be awarded credit for successfully completing this and possibly related continuing professional development offerings.",
    "course_description": "The course will commence with an overview of the philosophy and theoretical principles underlying RJ is and how it can be used as an alternative form of intervention and dispute resolution. The processes followed in a RJ approach will also be examined. Equipped with this foundation students will then undertake a minimum of 2 case studies where they will be required to prepare for and conduct RJ sessions. Reflection will be encouraged through plenary sessions and through compilation of a reflective journal covering individual and group activity and evaluation. Past experience suggests that a range of people and groups are likely to be involved including school pupils, young offenders, neighbours and (possibly, although it is potentially contentious) members of families where there is discord.For the purposes of this course proposal the case studies will simulate reality using case studies from such groupings. The Scottish government (Justice Directorate) has already expressed strong interest in working with the School on the RJ initiative and links have already been established with the Scottish RJ Forum. In time this may provide a launchpad for more RJ work and possibly a training facility providing CPD potential.",

Legal ramifications of these technologies are studied also with a view on their political, economic and ethical implications. Special attention will be given to efforts to create an international legal regime and associated proposals to standardise certain legal responses to robot technology globally.In addition to gaining a deeper understanding of the specific legal issues that are created by a number of particularly important applications of robotics and autonomous agent technology, students will also acquire a generic understanding of the types of problems that are raised by autonomous technologies for the theory of regulation. They will gain an understanding of the limits of regulation by law and the ability to evaluate comparatively other modes of regulation for a given problem",

    "summary": "This course aims to critically interrogate the status, purpose  and place of the Scots law of evidence in order to understand why the Scots law of evidence has developed in the way that it has.Students will identify and critically assess the various legal and non-legal principles that influence the black-letter evidential rules in Scotland, in order to further their understanding of the Scots law of evidence. This task will entail study not only of evidential legal scholarship but also consideration of certain non-legal disciplines such as psychology, philosophy and forensic science. Sociolegal factors that impact upon the process of proof both inside and outside the court-room will be studied and debated.Whilst the focus of the course will be on the Scots law of criminal evidence, consideration will also be given to the civil law of evidence and comparative legal scholarship related to the development of evidential doctrine elsewhere, in both adversarial and inquisitorial jurisdictions, where appropriate.The course will be divided into two parts. The first part of the course (comprising the first three seminars) will provide students with an introduction to the analytical framework that they will need to hone and apply in the second part of the course. The second part will seek to evaluate selected principles and rules of the Scots law of evidence in the light of the critical framework introduced earlier. The course also features some guest lectures from relevant figures in the profession in order to set the subject in context.",
    "course_description": "Part 1 of the course comprises three seminars which provide students with the analytical framework they require to explore evidential doctrine in Part 2.1.\tAn introduction to an inter-disciplinary approach to the Scots law of evidence: the processes which affect the construction, interpretation and importance of facts in litigation;2.\tThe theory and the practice: understanding the tension between the theoretical aims and the practical reality of the Scots law of evidence;3.\tTruth, justice, socio-legal scholarship and the law of evidence.Part 2 of the course comprises a series of seminars where individual principles and rules of the Scots law of evidence are evaluated in light of the scholarship introduced in Part 1. An indicative content (which may vary from year to year) is:4. The admissibility of unfairly obtained real evidence in Scots law;5. The corroboration requirement, associated evidential doctrine and principle v pragmatism ;6. Sexual Offences Trials and the Scottish Rape Shield Legislation;7. Hearsay and the Scots law of evidence, including the case for reform;8. The Moorov doctrine in the Scots criminal law of evidence;9. Expert evidence and Scots law.10.

    "summary": "This is a clinical course that provides practical tax experience to students. The Scottish Tax Clinic is a partnership with TaxAid, a UK charity that provides free professional income tax advice to low-income individuals. As part of this course, students will be trained to become a TaxAid volunteer and provide income tax advice under the supervision of a local tax practitioner. This course will require students to work closely with peers, academic staff and the tax profession. In the Scottish Tax Clinic, the students will be the main point of contact for clients and will engage with clients over the telephone, by email and (where permitting) face-to-face.The content of the course will depend upon the clients who access the Scottish Tax Clinic but will be limited to questions of income tax as it applies in Scotland. Common activities within the clinic might include changing PAYE tax codes; submitting tax returns; appealing HMRC penalties and debts; and, drafting letters of advice to clients. This course will therefore involve both a theoretical study of income tax and its practical application. Students will be required to reflect on their experience with a view to developing professional and soft skills.Students should be aware that this course is not taught like a traditional Honours course. Whilst training is provided at the start of semester 1, you will be expected to independently research your client\u00c2\u00bfs tax issue. Your workload will also vary according to your cases - and so some periods of the year will be busier.",
    "course_description": "The course will begin with a formal teaching programme which introduces students to the main knowledge and skills they will need for the clinical part of the course.  Most of the contact time will take place 'in clinic', where the course organiser will be on hand to provide support to the students. The clinic time will be used to accept new clients and to work on cases.The formal teaching programme is as follows:1.\tOnline participation in TaxAid training;2.\tWorkshop on common tax issues for low-income people;3.\tClient interviewing skills workshop;4.\tReflective writing workshop;5.\tDrafting letters of advice workshop;6.\tFilling out a tax return/ IT support workshop;7.\tIn-clinic support and experience.Students will also receive an appraisal at the end of Semester 1 to allow them to a) raise concerns; b) discuss their progress and participation; and c) work out an action plan for semester 2.",

It proceeds to consider six contemporary topics in sentencing with special emphasis on cutting-edge research and new trajectories in the field, including the work of the newly established Scottish Sentencing Council.

The course blends theoretical rigor with practical applications, making strategic legal reasoning accessible to a wide range of students.",
    "course_description": "\"Strategic Decision Making: Game Theory and the Law\" is an interdisciplinary honours-level course designed to explore the intricate relationship between legal decision-making and strategic behaviour through the lens of game theory. This course provides a comprehensive understanding of how game theory principles are applied to legal issues, from contract disputes to regulatory compliance and enforcement strategies. Students will engage with both classical and more contemporary game theoretic models and concepts, including Nash equilibrium, signalling, and evolutionary game theory, to understand and predict the outcomes of legal and quasi-legal interactions.The course content spans a wide range of topics, starting with foundational concepts of strategic behaviour and extending to complex scenarios such as litigation strategy, collective action problems, and the dynamics of negotiation and bargaining in legal contexts. Each week, seminars pair with specific chapters from the accompanying textbook to offer a learning experience that blends academic analysis with practical problem-solving exercises. Students will critically engage with game-theoretic concepts, applying them to analyse real-world legal dilemmas.The course is designed to cultivate a nuanced understanding of strategic decision-making within the legal framework and from a game-theoretical perspective, enhancing students' analytical skills and preparing them for complex legal reasoning in professional practice.No advanced mathematical background is required, as the course focuses on conceptual understanding and practical applications of game theory in legal contexts. This makes the course accessible to students from a variety of disciplines, including law and political science, who are interested in the strategic dimensions of legal theory and practice.",

A substantive approach may include a detailed analysis of the substantive law of that jurisdiction or of the practice of law in that jurisdiction.

The learning aim is to encourage students to approach their study in a foreign jurisdiction within a broadly \u00c2\u00bflaw in context\u00c2\u00bf intellectual setting. This will allow them both to draw on the substantive elements of law being instructed in the courses they are taking at the host institution, and to locate these principles in a wider cultural and socio-economic setting.

    "summary": "Fiduciary duties arise in legal relations where one party (the fiduciary) undertakes to act in the interests of another (the beneficiary) and acquires decision-making authority over the other's interests. In such relations, the fiduciary undertakes a duty to exercise his/her best judgment over the beneficiary's interests. Due to the existence of this core duty, the law imposes a set of very strict proscriptive duties, requiring a fiduciary to avoid or manage situations of conflict of interest.Established fiduciary positions include trustees, guardians, executors, agents, corporate directors or partners. The family of fiduciary relations has increased steadily throughout the past century, often in an unprincipled way. The label 'fiduciary relationship' has been applied loosely to relationships marked by 'trust and confidence', often as an instrumental shortcut to far-reaching legal remedies.In this course students will analyse the content and justification of fiduciary duties in private law relations, with a focus on English and Scottish law. Students will acquire an in-depth understanding of the specific duties to which a fiduciary is subject and of the remedies for breach of such duties. The course will allow students to acquire an integrated and coherent understanding of the regulation of fiduciary duties across various legal areas, such as trust law, company law or agency law.",
    "course_description": "The covered topics include:General theory of fiduciary duties:- historical origins of fiduciary duties- when do fiduciary duties arise?- the content of fiduciary duties- breach of fiduciary duties: overview of personal and proprietary remediesSpecific areas:- fiduciary duties in company law- fiduciary duties of investment intermediaries- fiduciary duties in banking law- fiduciary duties in family lawSpecific topics may vary from year to year.The course will be taught in 10 two-hour seminars. Each seminar will be a combination of teacher-led and student-led activities. The student-led activities include group discussion. Students will be divided in groups of three students and asked to discuss a topic among members, followed by a class discussion of group findings.",

The kind of issues to be addressed include the internal and external justification of conclusions of law; the use (and misuse) of deduction; the use (and misuse) of coherence-based arguments; arguments based on precedent; some fallacies common in legal reasoning; the place of consequentialist arguments in legal reasoning.

This course is focused on key concepts and ideas in quantitative research and requires minimal prior experience in mathematics and statistics, while providing students with skills and knowledge that will allow them to critically assess quantitative analyses and to undertake small data-driven research projects of their own. This course is intended to help students develop quantitative reasoning skills and as such takes a very concept-oriented approach, building up skills in mathematics and statistics as the semester progresses.",
    "course_description": "Finding areas of academic study and professional practice in which there is no reliance on quantitative data analysis is becoming increasingly difficult, as large-scale datasets are collected on voters, consumers, legislation, companies, impact of policy, international commerce, criminal activity, to name but a few, and analysed with the express purpose of guiding individual and collective decisions. With public policy and private decision-making increasingly relying on the findings of such analyses, understanding their provenance and implications is becoming more and more important for the legal profession and research in law. This course provides students in the LLB programmes at the University of Edinburgh Law School with an understanding of core concepts in social and legal research statistics and equips them with the ability to critically assess the data and data analyses they may encounter in their studies and in their professional life. The course starts with an overview of the process of data creation, types of quantitative and quantifiable data (with a focus on law and legal research), methods through which data can be summarised, appropriate interpretation of summary statistics, measures of uncertainty, and common mistakes in how these measures are understood. In Weeks 3 and 4, students will become acquainted with the tenets of probability theory, and the empirical and theoretical issues in identifying relationships of correlation and causation using quantitative data. Weeks 5 and 6 will be practical: students and the CO will meet in a computer lab, where they will access Microsoft Excel, gain insight into tidy data structures, and practically apply the knowledge from Weeks 1-4. Students will learn basic techniques for accessing, summarising, and visualising quantitative data, with CO-chosen data related to socio-legal research. These two lab sessions are also a preparation for the students\u00c2\u00bf group presentations, which will be assigned at the end of the second lab session. The three sessions that follow cover more advanced issues in quantitative data analysis, addressing the problems of the possibility and limits of predictive power of quantitative analysis, ethical concerns in the use of primary and secondary data sources, providing an overview of recent innovative work in empirical legal studies, and putting forward a set of guidelines for successfully reading and understanding quantitative analyses in academic work and policy reports. The final session will be reserved for short presentations of students\u00c2\u00bf group projects, in which they will select one of the provided data sources, assess its provenance and typical use, interrogate any ethical concerns in re-use of data, and provide key insights into the content of the data using techniques they learned in the lab sessions.",

The history of the principle against unjustified enrichment will be considered first from an historical perspective, before a consideration of the component elements of claims in the modern law. The course will set unjustified enrichment within the wider context of the law of obligations, as well as considering its boundaries and connections with other areas of law such as property law, trusts, and negotiorum gestio. The nature of both direct and indirect unjustified enrichment claims will be studied.",
    "course_description": "The course may include seminars addressing the following topics (among others):1. Historical development of the legal principle against the retention of unjustified enrichments.2. External boundaries of enrichment law with other areas of law.3. Internal taxonomy of unjustified enrichment.4. Enrichment by transfer.5. Enrichment by interference.6. Enrichment by imposition.7. Third party enrichment.8. Defences.9. The measure of recovery.10.

The course will focus in particular on the disciplines governing trade in goods, services and the trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights.",

Subsequently, students will explore the key legal disciplines relating to international trade in goods, including the core principles of non-discrimination and rules on market access. In the second part of the course, students will consider instances in which WTO members may deviate from their basic obligations under WTO law, notably to use trade-restrictive measures in order to promote and protect other (non-trade) values and interests, such as the protection of public health or the environment. Finally, students will be exposed to some of the contemporary challenges facing the WTO, including development issues and the proliferation of regional trade agreements. In the second half of Semester 2, the course will explore areas outside the regulation of trade in goods, namely the disciplines relating to services and intellectual property rights.Seminar 1.

We will examine the place of the Qur'an and other scriptural sources of Islamic Law, the various uses of analogy, consensus, and legal reasoning in the formation of legal-ethical thinking, and the development of distinct schools of Law (both Sunni and Shi'a). After building this foundational knowledge, the second half of the course critically examines key issues in the colonial and modern period such as Islamic Law's place in Muslim majority nation-states, proposal for reform in Islamic ethics and law, and debates in Islamic jurisprudence on human rights, gender, liberal democracy, constitutional law and religious minorities. Students will be introduced to both Islamic legal texts and various theoretical frameworks for interpreting Shari'a.Student Learning Experience Information:The course involves one two-hour seminar per week, which will consist of a combination of lectures and discussion based on readings prepared in advance. Each student will be required to give a short presentation at one seminar during the semester on an issue related to the theme or text for the day.

    "course_description": "This course will focus on the contemporary issues arising from the fast-developing modern capital markets, which have received heightened attention from scholars, practitioners and policymakers. It aims to provide students with the fundamental knowledge and leading-edge academic insights to analyse the role of UK capital markets law in addressing these contemporary issues.It will cover four themes; under each theme, a couple of interrelated, specific topics will be explored.The first theme is 'information disclosures and transparency' (seminars 1 and 2), which is traditionally one of the main focuses of capital markets law. While this part will introduce the well-established financial and legal theories of the significance of information disclosures, it will concentrate on the reforms to the regulatory regimes of listing, public offer, prospectus and ongoing disclosures, which have been implemented or proposed by UK law makers and regulators, as well as the evolving enforcement of civil liabilities for misstatements. It will further consider and analyse the objectives the UK authority means to achieve through these legal reforms and their potential effects.The second theme is 'market order and integrity' (seminars 3, 4 and 5). This part will introduce the legal rules that prohibit fraudulent and wrongful conduct in securities transactions (market abuse) and restrict speculative and highly risky activities (short selling and economically equivalent activities), with a particular focus on their effectiveness in addressing the new threats arising from abusive or speculative activities.The third theme is 'alternative capital markets' (seminars 6 and 7). This part will explore the emerging and fast-growing markets beyond traditional capital markets, which are spontaneous, economically driven developments in modern finance. It will focus particularly on the markets for crowdfunding and crypto finance, their similarities with traditional capital markets in terms of economic functions, and the differences in legal treatment. It will also examine the impact of regulatory tightening on the operations of these markets.The fourth theme is 'new normal in capital markets' (seminars 8 and 9). This part will consider how capital markets law adapts to and accommodates novel business structures, focusing mainly on the implemented and ongoing reforms to the listing rules governing dual-class shares (DCSs) and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). It will also look into the issues related to sustainable finance, which represents the major trend in the conceptual and ideological evolution of finance, and examine how capital markets law may engage with this trend.In the last seminar, under the lecturer's guidance, students will apply their knowledge acquired from previous seminars to work on legal or business cases. Case studies will take the form of group presentations.By the end of the course, students will be able to carry out theoretically inspired and academically rigorous analyses of the role of capital markets law and the interactions between practice and law concerning capital markets development.",

    "summary": "This is an advanced course in public law (but the course content presumes no prior legal training and an undergraduate law degree is not a prerequisite).The course will engage at an intensive level with particular themes and issues emerging in contemporary comparative constitutional law and applied constitutional theory, and a focus on other Commonwealth jurisdictions as they relate to current issues in British constitutionalism. In particular, the course will examine: the methodology and substance of comparative constitutional law as a discrete sub-discipline of public law; the theory and practice of plurinational constitutionalism across the globe; constitutional identity, integration and accommodation in deeply divided societies; theories of secession; the theory and practice of constitutional transitions; dialogic constitutionalism and the parliamentary state, and democratic dialogue more generally (including European, Latin American, South African, and South Asian variants); and current issues in Westminster-model constitutionalism beyond the West in South Asia, Asia Pacific, Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean.At the end of the course, students would gain a solid grounding in the methods of comparative constitutional law, a good awareness of some of its major current doctrinal and theoretical concerns, and perhaps equally importantly, an opportunity to take a virtual empirical 'world tour' of countries.",
    "course_description": "In recent decades the comparative approach to studying constitutional law has become a major and perhaps even a dominant method in the field. It has generated a very substantial literature and the course reading will reflect many of the central texts. Adopting this comparative approach, students will be expected to develop a sophisticated sense of how to read relevant primary materials, such as constitutions, primary and secondary legislation, and key political documents such as peace agreements.They will also be expected to develop the ability to engage with demanding secondary texts dealing with substantive constitutional law, theoretical work that helps us to understand constitutionalism in context, and literature from relevant related disciplines like comparative politics, political sociology, constitutional history, and political economy. Through consideration of major themes (see short description above), they will have the opportunity to consider how these play out in distinctive political, social, economic, and cultural contexts of countries in different regions of the world.The course will address the following core elements. Reading lists and seminar sheets will be developed two to three weeks in advance to keep the subject-matter fresh. See short description above for an outline of the core content of the course. It will consider questions like the following:What is 'comparative constitutional law'? What are its major concerns and what are its boundaries? Why has it become a popular approach in constitutional law today? What specific methodological issues arise when we adopt a comparative approach to constitutional law? What are the main substantive and methodological critiques of comparative constitutional law?How do we approach 'multinational states' as a sociologically distinctive category of polity? What are the main theoretical arguments and institutional strategies in addressing the specific constitutional challenges of such countries? This part of the course would also take a closer consideration of the liberal democratic model called the 'plurinational state' in addressing the constitutional problems of multinational polities, its theoretical foundations, substantive features, the practical challenges that confront the plurinational state as a viable model of constitutional accommodation, and looks comparatively at empirical cases studies such as the UK, Spain, Canada, and Belgium.What happens when constitutional accommodation fails in multinational / plurinational or otherwise plural societies? In the context of Scotland after the Brexit and independence referendums (and the possibility of a second independence referendum), we look at the difficult issue of secession as a solution to autonomy claims from the perspective of competing theoretical accounts of secession, such as 'consensual', 'choice' and 'just cause' categories.What is a 'constitutional transition'? How do we define this? Why is it important? What are the types or models of constitutional transition that have been identified in the academic literature? Are Scotland and the UK in a constitutional transition? If so, how does it relate to these models of transition?Outline Content:The course also takes a comparative look at how some of the main constitutional characteristics of the Westminster system of parliamentary government have been applied in the different social, cultural and political context of countries in the broader Commonwealth, and what insights this affords us for a deeper understanding of current debates on the UK constitution itself, including the relationship between legal and political models of constitutionalism, institutional dialogue, territorial organisation of states, and constitutional design.Student Learning Experience:The course will be seminar-based with students taking a 2-hour seminar every week. Students will be assigned assessed class presentation topics, which would serve as the basis for collective discussion.",

Each year, the lecturers will pick a range of topics from contemporary issues that have received heightened attention in the scholarship, the practice and the agenda of policy-makers.Because this course builds on previous knowledge, it will not cover the basic elements of WTO and international investment law, or law and development. It will instead centre upon pending cases, reform proposals, sensitive policy matters and unresolved legal issues.Students will be required to read both primary and secondary sources in preparation for the seminars. It will be impossible to prepare for the seminars by doing a superficial reading of these materials, but students will need to critically think on these materials on the basis of the questions set in seminar handouts.This course is designed to encourage and develop the use of transferable skills relating to the application of law to complex scenarios, critical judgement on the law and the formulation of legal/policy responses to complex questions. Students who succeed in this course will be well-positioned to handle international economic law in a professional manner.",
    "course_description": "International Economic Law is in a state of constant development and adaptation. There are continuous changes in the applicable law: the proliferation of FTAs entering into force and the re-negotiation of commitments under the WTO and the existing BITs are changing the international legal landscape on trade regulation and investment protection. Moreover, the existing laws apply to an ever-changing reality and interact with other regimes of national and international law.Lawyers who intend to do research or provide professional advice in this area must be able to go beyond textbook-knowledge of the underpinning disciplines and engage with unresolved legal issues and policy dilemmas.This course aims precisely to expose the students to a range of 'liminal' problems in international trade and investment law, and international development. These problems can be critical for pending litigation, or can feature in the public debate over legal/institutional reforms and the global negotiation of international commitments. Some of the topics are eminently technical; others instead require a holistic awareness of the issues involved and a nuanced understanding of socio-economic realities.Each week, the course will tackle a different contemporary topic, combining both substantive and institutional aspects of international trade law or/and investment law, and international development. Learning objectives and topics might vary each year. However, they will converge towards the development of specific transferable skills (see below).Students enrolled in the LLM International Economic Law might want to consider taking this advanced course to further expand and deepen their knowledge and critical understanding of WTO law, international investment law and Law and Development.Topics this year may include, but are not limited to:* COVID 19 and Trade* Renewable energy in the trade and investment regimes* The resource \u00c2\u00bfcurse\u00c2\u00bf* Corruption in ISDS* Trade wars* Institutional diversity in the global economic order* Law and the Sustainable Development Goals* ISDS Reform, taking back control?* The politicisation of appointments processes in trade and investment tribunals* Updating trade and investment agreements: problems and processes* Regulatory Cooperation*Climate Clubs",

This includes the ability to assess and evaluate critically the IEL implications of past, current and future trade and investment policies and regulations of any country.Appreciate, identify and assess the role of law in global society. This module probes and strengthens the students ability to interpret the legal foundations and implications of global political, economic and social trends. To a reasonable extent, students acquire the habit of analysing the necessity of legal reforms and will be able to provide workable suggestions.Use lawyering skills. Students are exposed to tasks and activities that hone their transferrable skills and prove useful in their career-path. These tasks include: parsing long documents, decoding scholarly commentary, engaging in legal hermeneutics, assessing litigation strategies, inferring general trends, weighing conflicting interests, arguing and pleading in public.Think critically. Besides understanding and memorising materials, students are trained to question received knowledge. This is based on the study of advanced commentaries and primary sources, and on the discussion with the colleagues and the lecturers. The lecturers moderate the discussion so as to maximise the students critical skills and take them at the borders of their zone of comfort.Form personal views and share them with an audience. In-class participation is designed to encourage the formulation of personal ideas. The discussion format will support and train to confrontation and exchange of ideas. Clarity and incisiveness are crucial to fully benefit from in-class discussion (oral communication) and fare well in the assessment (written communication).",

They will be able to engage with complex areas of patent law and develop strong argumentation skills.Skills and Abilities in Personal and Intellectual Autonomy:The seminars (combined with active learning exercises and mandatory readings) require students to criticallyand autonomously engage with literature as well as practice-based issues of patent law.  The individual and group activities, the editorial writing exercise, as well as the final essay encourage students  to take some initiative to analyse, synthetise and present the results of independent and/or collective search.  The group activities require that students take responsibility for their own work but also for the work of their group. They will have to work collaboratively and engage with the ideas and arguments of others.Skills and Abilities in Communication:For some of the group activities envisaged as active learning exercises, students will have to create a short presentation on a topic discussed during the different sessions. By doing so, students will develop their communication skills as well as their presentation skills.Skills and Abilities in Personal Effectiveness:The essay at the end of the term requires that students apply critical analysis, evaluation and synthesis of the issues discussed during the seminars. By doing so, the essay will allow students to develop original and creative responses to patent-based problems. They will be able to critically review, consolidate and extend knowledge, skills, practices and thinking in patent law.Technical/practical skills:The combination of active learning exercises, presentation of group work and essay necessitates that students plan and execute the different tasks carefully.",

To do so, it examines theories of whether law impacts on transactions struck between parties, and the role that lawyers have in undertaking such transactions.The course then applies these concepts to practical examples of corporate law in action by way of four specifically themed pairs of seminars. Each pair of seminars is based on a case study delivered by a leading legal practitioner.  In the first seminar of each pair we will explore the theories and law underpinning a certain area. In the second seminar of each pair the practitioner will deliver their case study in that area, and then be available to answer questions from students as to how or why such transactions developed the way they did.  As a result, this course explores what corporate lawyers do, and by extension corporate law does, in practice across the UK market.",

    "summary": "This course considers the regulation of the life sciences, drawing out two central problems relating to the use of law in this dynamic field. First, it is often difficult for regulators to keep pace with rapid scientific and technological advances. This means that existing legal concepts and regulatory frameworks can soon appear outmoded and inadequate. Second, in an age of moral pluralism, it can be difficult for stakeholders to secure social consensus on how new biotechnologies should be controlled and exploited. As a result, the regulation of biotechnology has often been a site of sharp disagreement.This course examines how these fundamental tensions are mediated within the legal and regulatory structures governing biotechnology and the life sciences at both the national and international levels. While this course focuses on the UK as its primary jurisdiction, it also provides scope for students to reflect on the issues raised in relation to their home jurisdictions (if different).",

However, the actions developed at local, national and regional levels are absolutely crucial. First, their study is indispensable to assess the effectiveness of the global climate policy. Second, while international negotiations have not been successful in the last years, concrete actions have been implemented at national and regional levels. The sub-international levels of governance are therefore becoming the most dynamic and influent power centres in the fight against climate change.EU climate and energy law offers a fascinating example of the dynamism of sub-international levels. It also reveals the intricate relations between international, regional and national levels when it comes to climate policy.On one hand, the EU's policy is influenced by its international commitments and by the international negotiations. On the other, the EU aims to become the leader of climate governance, by tailoring its internal law to achieve this objective. EU climate and energy law is meant to be ambitious and to influence third countries. Therefore, the class will be interesting for EU and non-EU students alike.",

It will examine the treatment of key areas in property law, in particular ownership and limited real rights. Both moveable and immoveable property will be considered. In its comparative approach, the course will refer to jurisdictions in continental Europe and the USA as well as other mixed legal systems such as Louisiana and South Africa. Recent initiatives to harmonise property law in Europe will be considered, in particular the Draft Common Frame of Reference.The course is designed mainly for those students who have already studied the law of property in their own system. Those who have not may still apply for a place in the course, but they should be aware that significant additional study may be required.",
    "course_description": "Beginning with an overview of civil law and common law systems of property, the course will then consider transfer of ownership of moveable property and of land. The law of possession will be examined, before the course moves on to consider subordinate rights such as servitudes and security rights. Finally, convergence and harmonisation of property law will be studied.The course will be taught by weekly seminars of two hours. A handout with reading will be issued in advance. Students are expected to have done the reading before the seminar and to participate in discussion based on this.",

In doing so it shows the flexibility and diversity of the concept and how different models of trusts have circulated over time and space.The course further examines the values underpinning certain regulatory choices across a number of jurisdictions as well as the boundaries of trust law and what is and what is not permitted across jurisdiction. In addition to examining trusts in the doctrinal context of specific legal systems, the course also considers trusts in a conflict of laws perspective.The course examines the notion of 'trust' from a functional perspective. It is not limited to any particular system of 'trust law' and, in particular, it is not a course devoted to the \u00c2\u00bfcommon law trust\u00c2\u00bf only, being international and comparative in its approach. The trust jurisdictions considered include England and Wales, the United States of America, New Zealand, selected offshore jurisdictions, mixed legal systems (such as Scotland, South Africa and Quebec) and civil law systems, including, for instance, Germany and France but also Italy. Alongside selected mainstream trust jurisdictions, this course also considers European harmonisation projects, and other international trust instruments.This course does not require any previous knowledge of trust law. However, it does presuppose a basic knowledge of EACH of the following: the law of obligations, property law, and insolvency law; some understanding of succession law and international private law is also desirable. The course also presupposes familiarity with basic comparative law methodologies as well as a basic understanding of the concept of civil law, common law and mixed legal jurisdictions.",

    "summary": "This course provides a detailed exploration of two legal regimes in the biomedical context (comprising both health care and health research, broadly defined) that are of increasing importance: data protection/privacy law and the common law duty of confidentiality. Both of these legal regimes have experienced rapid development in the 21st century. New medical innovations, greater international research collaborations, and the push for Big Data research and digitisation of society generate pertinent, complex questions about what ought to be done (if anything) with our personal (and patient) data, and under what legal and ethical conditions. As part of this exploration, brief consideration will also be given to a third related and emerging legal regime, namely a right of privacy in terms of the common law and the tort of misuse of private information. This course will enable students to explore some of the key concepts, rules, and functions of confidentiality and data protection/privacy laws as they operate in biomedicine. The central focus of the course is the interplay between UK data protection law, the common law duty of confidentiality, and wider frameworks in Europe and at the international level (including the Data Protection Act 2018, the UK GDPR and EU GDPR, European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence concerning Art. 8 ECHR, and Council of Europe and OECD data privacy frameworks). We will analyse and evaluate this interaction drawing on a range of sources, including case law, statute, policy, academic literature, advisory opinions, and domestic and international laws and practices.The aims and objectives of the course are to:1. develop an advanced grounding in the concepts, principles, and rules underpinning confidentiality and data protection in biomedicine;2. foster understand of the differences and commonalities between the legal regimes of data protection law and the common law duty of confidentiality, and why these matter;3. critically analyse emerging issues within this field from the perspective of confidentiality and data protection, including: Big Data and challenges to the data minimisation principle, international data sharing, use of NHS patient data for research purposes, the limits of data anonymisation, and blurred boundaries among clinical, research and administrative uses of personal and patient data; and4. develop a critical awareness in students of these issues, and to promote the ability to evaluate legal and regulatory actions taken in response to new developments, including the failure to adequately protect data and ensure confidentiality in some instances.",
    "course_description": "This course will consist of 10 seminars organised into three parts, covering 'Foundations', 'Core Elements' and exploration of 'Contemporary Issues':Part 1: Foundations of the legal regimes1.\tThe common law duty of confidentiality: history and legal development through case studies2.\tThe common law duty of confidentiality: modern context and interface with ethics and practice (e.g. General Medical Council, National Data Guardian, Confidentiality Advisory Group)3.\tFrom confidentiality to privacy (including the tort of misuse of private information) to data protection law (focusing on Art 8 ECHR and ECtHR jurisprudence)Part 2: Core elements of data protection law in biomedicine4.\tData protection terminology and underlying principles: introduction to the GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018 (including focus on privacy notices and DPIAs)5.\tThe legal grounds for lawful processing of personal data in the biomedical context: a focus on consent (versus) the public interest6.\tChallenges arises from Big Data and large-scale biomedical initiatives: a focus on the data minimisation principle7.\tRights of the data subject qua patient and research participantPart 3: Contemporary issues in the biomedical context8.\tTwo biomedicine challenges in data protection law: Big Data and international data transfers9.\tMaking data protection law work for biomedical research: is reform needed?10.\tBringing the legal regimes together in biomedicine: how might the common law duty of confidentiality, tort of misuse of private information, and data protection law work better together, if at all?",

    "summary": "Since the Cold War, the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) has witnessed a series of intrastate wars that are among the most prolonged conflicts in the world. As of 2021, there were nine states with active armed conflicts in the region. The failure of conflict resolution and the transition process in the region calls for new and critical approaches. This course provides students with theoretical and practical skills and contextualised knowledge of the EMR relating to transversal issues that interact with conflict and peaceful transition. Students will benefit from a deep and comprehensive vision of the region which will enhance their capacity to offer contextualised and integrative solutions to problematic situations introduced as real-life case studies.",
    "course_description": "The course is composed of ten main lessons (excluding the reading week).Week 1. Towards the creation of a new knowledgeThe lesson provides an overview of the objectives, outcomes, and evaluation for the course. It aims to include students\u00c2\u00bf expectations and needs into the development and implementation of the course, notably on the choice of case studies. The lecture introduces key terms and concepts (why the \u00c2\u00bfEastern Mediterranean Region\u00c2\u00bf and not the Middle East and North Africa) linked to a discussion around the need for a more inclusive and contextualised knowledge. Students will also be introduced to self-reflective exercises on positionality and privileges.Week 2. Geopolitics of conflict and peace in the EMR IThe lesson maps the evolution of conflicts in the EMR region (i.e., in terms of localization, urbanisation, length) and unpacks the complexity of modern conflicts in relation to existing legal norms and systems. This lesson focuses on the post-Arab Uprisings period to include the fragmentation of the global, regional and national orders, as well as the rise of non-state actors and challenges to the legitimacy of the State political and legal system (including violent extremism).Week 3. Geopolitics of conflict and peace in the EMR IIBuilding on Lesson 2, the lesson outlines more of the main dynamics that can be observed in modern armed conflicts in the EMR. It maps internal and external influences (i.e., the role of emergent powers and illiberal actors) in conflicts and peace, and the impact of international interventions in the region on the legitimacy of the state as the political unit of reference.Week 4. Local conflict dynamics and peacemakingAfter outlining the complexity of the \u00c2\u00bfsmall\u00c2\u00bf peace - \u00c2\u00bfbig\u00c2\u00bf peace relation and the concept of hybridity, the lesson introduces students to the importance of local peace processes as legal tools for conflict resolution. Students will be given the opportunity to explore the largest dataset of peace agreements, developed by PeaceRep and hosted at the University of Edinburgh. Based on this exploration, they will be invited to reflect on the impact of new conflict dynamics on conflict management, especially in terms of actors and methods.Week 5. Reconsider the conflict-peace continuumThe lesson leads students to reassess and discuss a number of assumptions on armed conflicts and peace in the EMR, such as the fact that conflicts necessarily happen in weak states and the positive framing of peace. Do help this thinking, the lesson introduces concepts such as negative peace, formalised unsettlement and informal settlements. It also touches on the intersection between the expediency of national talks and the political agenda of national stakeholders, and the disruption of progress for local mediators.Week 6. State-society relationsThe lesson outlines the impact of key dynamics of modern conflicts and peace (discussed during previous lessons) on state-society relations and the way we think of the state in the EMR. Students will discover and discuss concepts of legitimacy, resistance and agency, as well as the consequences of the lack of regional leadership in the EMR. It also examines power-sharing arrangements, and in particular consociationalism, as a response to ethno-national conflicts.Week 7. Humanitarian and human rights lawThe lesson lays out general knowledge of the international humanitarian and human rights standards relating to a number of key issues in conflict and post-conflict settings. It also introduces challenges of legal transfers and adaptation of international legal tools and norms in the cultural and socio-political contexts of the EMR, leading to a discussion of the universality of certain legal rights and norms.Week 8. The health, conflict and peace nexusAfter introducing the flaws of the existing legal framework, the lesson looks at the interactions (direct, indirect and inter-generational) between health issues and conflicts dynamics, with a focus on natural resources and environmental challenges. It also provides an overview of the opportunities to harness the peace dividends of health and of the partners of health and peaceful transition in the EMR.Week 9. The challenges of inclusive peace in extreme diversity contextsBuilding on previous weeks, the lesson zooms on the role of social leaders \u00c2\u00bf notably religious and tribal leaders \u00c2\u00bf in fuelling violence and prompting peace, including their interactions with governance stakeholders. The lesson also includes insights on the inclusion of women and civil society in conflict resolution mechanisms and opportunities to make peace more inclusive. Finally, students will be invited to reflect on the prioritisation of immediate (and imperfect) peace over comprehensive, more sustainable political settlements.Week 10. Women, girls and gender in peace and conflictAfter introducing the gendered dynamics of conflict, and peace, the lesson questions the depiction of women as mere victims of conflicts, and gendered mobilization for peace and wider political participation. The discussion also considers contestation of masculinities in an overwhelmingly patriarchal socio-cultural EMR environments. Students will be invited to reconsider Western approaches to peace that attempt to enforce liberal understanding of women\u00c2\u00bfs role and positions, including the problematic nature of implementation of ideals involving security element so often run/provided by men.",

    "summary": "The aim of this elective is to provide students with a basic knowledge of what a construction lawyer does.  The course is an interesting mix of the skills required to draft and negotiate contracts, and the skills required to advise on and resolve disputes.Students will be introduced to the various parties involved in a building project and explore the contractual relationships which are entered into. They will undertake practical exercises designed to demonstrate how a building contract is compiled, and negotiated, by a lawyer. They will also learn how to draft and negotiate a Collateral Warranty which is a contract which gives rights to third parties connected to a construction project.Students will then learn about some of the key issues which arise during the life of a building project. What happens when a project is delayed or disrupted? When, and how, can the cost of a project increase? What payment rules have to be followed and what happens if they are not? What types of claims can be made?The elective concludes by  focussing on  Adjudication which is a unique statutory procedure used for resolving disputes in the construction industry. The final session is a mock Adjudication which will pull together many of the issues discussed in the earlier lectures and workshops.",
    "course_description": "This course aims to develop a student\u00c2\u00bfs  understanding of:-\tthe importance of awareness of the construction sector;-\tthe importance of contract law within the specialist area of construction law; and-\tthe role of a lawyer in the life cycle of a construction project from procurement and the completion of the construction documentation through to the resolution of any disputes which may arise.The objective of the course is to enhance a student's legal skills and knowledge in this area of the law. It is also aims to enhance and consolidate their knowledge, understanding and personal reflection on the Law Society of Scotland's PEAT 1 Mandatory and Core Outcomes, which they have already experienced and shall continue to experience on the Diploma core courses.In particular, by the end of the elective, a student should be confident that they will be able to:-\tunderstand how construction projects are structured; who the relevant parties are and what they do; and how the numerous contracts entered into in connection with a construction project are structured;-\tunderstand the terminology and key concepts used in Building Contracts and Professional Appointments;-\tappreciate the component parts of a Building Contract and how they interact with each other;-\tunderstand the purpose of Collateral Warranties and be able to identify the key points which require negotiation;-\tshow an awareness of the unique approach which building contracts take to the time for completion of a project and payment processes;-\tappreciate why, and how, claims are made under building contracts;-\tanalyse a claim under a contract;-\tknow the dispute resolution options; and-\tadvise on how an Adjudication works in practice.",

    "course_description": "Indicative Teaching ProgrammeGiven the deliberately open and responsive nature of this course, it would be inappropriate to attempt to give concrete topics. The topics will be chosen with the class in any given year under the oversight and direction of the course teachers.

Suggestions and proposals will be invited from the students. Group interaction in this process will be encouraged and this will then be used as a means to take learning forward. Groups will be assisted to choose topics, develop materials, prepare to lead on seminar discussions, and to encourage mutual learning. The first few sessions will be led by staff as exemplars of the kinds of critical approaches and insights that can be explored. Skills development is central the course and will form an early part of the course interaction.Thus, the overall outline of the course will have the following format:Part 1 - Skills development (Seminars 1-4)Seminar 1: Introduction: the course, expectations, overview of core topics in medical jurisprudence, likely topics and groupsSeminar 2: Final topics selection and groupsSeminar 3: Submission of preliminary reading lists/course handouts ahead of Seminar 3, to be discussed in class, and running order of seminars selected (final handouts to be submitted one day later, i.e. by 2pm Tuesday 26th January)Seminar 4: Key skills development in critical thinking: staff examplePart 2 Exploring contemporary issues (weeks 5-10)(These will consist of student-led group seminars)Expectations for each seminar include:1)\tStudent-led seminar based on student-prepared reading material to be distributed in advance (topic and group selection in Seminar 2 and draft reading material distributed ahead of Seminar 3, as described above).2)\tClear learning objectives and conclusions to be prepared for each seminar.3)\tFull preparation ahead of each seminar and participation in discussion by all in class.",

Modern technologies are changing rapidly (disrupting) established commercial and business models,  creating in their wake new regulatory issues, but also force us on occasions to reflect about the very foundations of law and the nature of legal regulation. The time when 'e-commerce' was largely restricted to B-C transactions on the Internet are long over, and while some of the fundamental issues that the Internet created for commercial law (such as jurisdictions or enforcement) remain pertinent, entirely new and unforeseen problems emerge.",
    "course_description": "This course addresses some of the most topical and current issues in national and international responses to new disruptive business models. It also addresses issues of international governance of technology.  It responds flexibly to the latest international developments at the intersection of  law, the economy and technology, identifying challenges to current legal regimes in emerging fields of technology, where the law is either not yet settled, or not any longer achieving its purpose. Topics in any given year might include the impact of computer technology and automation on the banking sector, the dangers of and responses to technology enabled economic crimes,  the potential of new forms to produce, reproduce and disseminate information for the international IP regime and the knowledge economy, the data governance and compliance challenges of emerging technologies and more generally legal responses to disruptive business models, both nationally and internationally.It prepares students to function as lawyers in a world where rapid technological change not only  creates new uncertainties, but also new opportunities for businesses, and where regulators courts and legal counsels face entirely new and unprecedented challenges. The course will also look at the enabling aspects of technology for legal regulation and enforcement, the changing nature of global law firms in an ICT environment, and the alternatives to regulation through legal rules and dispute resolution through litigation.The course will be highly responsive to current developments in the intersection between law and technologies, following closely current research interests of the teaching staff. This will introduce students to issues that are currently considered in need of answers, and prepare them for their own, independent research dissertation. As a result, the teaching programme can change substantially from year to year, as problems become solved and their solution settled, and new problems and research issues emerge. The indicative programme for the first year of this course though will contain:New money? Regulating sales with  Bitcoin and cyryptocurrenciesNew stock markets? Automated trading Systems and the lawNew commercial crimes? Cyber insurance fraud and high tech crimeNew freedoms? Legal issues of the Mobile Internet and m-commerceNew death? Digital assets in the life crisis: divorce, insolvency, deathNew taxes? Taxing issues for international e-commerceNew Frontiers? Commercial micro satellites, global trade and the law.New manufacturing? 3-D printing and the lawNew friends? Social Networks and the law of the sharing economyNew players?

    "summary": "This course is a comparative contract law course. Contract law is part of each country's national law. The main focus of the course is fundamental concepts of the law of contract, which arise in all systems. The course compares national systems of contract law, principally Scots, English, French and German law. The course also considers some of the harmonisation initiatives that have taken place in Europe over the last decade, principally the Draft Common Frame of Reference (Principles, Definitions and Model Rules of European Private Law).One of the themes of the course is whether there is, indeed, a split between the common law and the civil law tradition in the field of contract law within European countries. Is there, in fact, a gulf between the two traditions? Are harmonising initiatives likely to succeed? The debate on these issues will be informed by the analysis of the national legal systems which form the focus of this course.",

Company law has begun to adopt a wider framework than the traditional focus on directors duties to shareholders.  International human rights law explicitly brought corporate responsibility into its domain.  Private law is increasingly used to enforce what were once seen as voluntary or extra-legal commitments.  The result is a widening of the legal concept of corporate responsibility and with it, both the legal accountability and the legal liability of business, nationally and internationally.",

As this list demonstrates, the course is wide-ranging, though always focused on the specific issue of corporate responsibility. It draws on legislation and cases from the UK, Europe, further jurisdictions and international law.",

Later seminars address questions relating to victims, community and custodial sentences, restorative justice and the jury before concluding with questions about penal reform, transformation and global challenges.The course is taught by way of a weekly seminar. Students should come prepared for each seminar by reading the essential reading beforehand. Students are expected to contribute to seminars by way of discussion and debate among the whole group or in smaller groups.Students will also have the opportunity to observe criminal courts in action and to carry out their own observations on criminal justice processes. These observations will form part of discussions at subsequent seminars.The course also has the aim of providing opportunities for students to practice the research skills necessary to explore and critically assess academic and policy research which informs current criminal justice approaches.

It explicitly emphasises the key roles of theory in research and issues of politics, power, ethics and reflexivity that are so crucial to the research process.  Seminars form the backbone of the course through which different research methods will be critically examined.  Some of these seminars will require you to take the lead and present your emerging ideas on research to peers, invited criminal justice practitioners and academic staff.  Semester one assessments will prepare you for, and give you feedback towards, the development of independently researched Research Projects that you will undertake for assessment in Semester two.  You will be allocated a supervisor for your project who will support you through one to one supervision.  Semester two assessments take the form of a PowerPoint presentation of your project (which will be organised like a presentation at an academic conference) and a written Research Findings Report that will be assessed and used to disseminate your findings through giving feedback to practitioners who have supported your work.The course is an essential element of academic research training.  Even if you do not wish to undertake further research it will equip you with the knowledge and experience to evaluate the research of others.  If you do wish to undertake further research (whether in external organisations or as a PhD) the course will equip you with the kinds of knowledge, skills and experience to better undertake that work.  The practical nature of the course also ensures that, regardless of your future professional aspirations, the course will be of value to you and to your personal and professional development.",

    "course_description": "This course examines current issues, debates and trends in criminal law. It introduces students to a range of important recent developments in criminal law and the criminal process, and to the controversies and debates surrounding those developments. The course does not introduce the basics of the criminal law and its operation: it presumes that students are familiar with these. Instead, it focuses on recent changes within this field that are important or controversial, and that illustrate broader debates and trends. Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to think critically about these developments, and to evaluate proposals for reform of the law.Because this course focuses on issues of current importance, its precise content is not fixed and may change slightly from year to year. However, in any given year, the course will examine at least some topics from each of the following areas:Criminalisation: changes in the scope of the substantive criminal law, and what conduct is and is not criminal (or should and should not be criminal). Possible seminar topics include the allegedly dramatic expansion of the criminal law in many jurisdictions; the influence of security on the scope of the criminal law; new forms of criminalisation, such as civil preventive orders; and debates over the proper basis for criminal legislation.\u00c2\u00bb The criminal process: changes to the law governing criminal procedure and evidence, and the rights of suspects and accused persons in criminal cases. Possible seminar topics include procedural rights and the presumption of innocence; varieties of evidence in criminal cases, their admissibility and exclusion; and guilty pleas and other measures designed to reduce emphasis on criminal trials.\u00c2\u00bb Sentencing and sanctions: changes in the types of sentence and sanction available to criminal courts, and to the legal consequences of criminal conviction. Possible seminar topics include preventive detention measures, such as indeterminate or post-sentence detention; criminal records and their implications; and other post-sentence and ancillary restrictions on convicted offenders.The course is taught through seminars. Reading lists will be provided for each seminar; students are expected to prepare by completing these in advance. Students are also expected to participate actively in seminar discussion. Seminars will not generally include lectures or long presentations from staff; rather, students will learn primarily through reflective and critical discussion of the seminar topics and readings. To reward student participation in seminar discussion, participation in class will be assessed. Students will also complete a final assessed essay, which will involve critical analysis and evaluation of a topic or group of topics from the course.",

The approach adopted will be comparative and reference will be made throughout to other Anglo-American and European legal systems. Fundamental conceptual structures will be compared, as well as specific problems, with a view to illuminating not only differences but also the common features of those systems. Particular attention will be given to the impact of Human Rights law on the law of delict and current debates on the extent of the constitutionalisation of private law. Recent initiatives to establish a common European law of torts will also be discussed.The course is designed mainly for those students who have already studied the law of obligations in their own system. Those who have not may still apply for a place in the course, but they should be aware that additional study may be required.Students require an undergraduate degree in law to study this course.This course is particularly suitable for students who have already studied delict/tort in reasonable depth at undergraduate level and who wish to pursue their interest further in comparative perspective.",

    "summary": "This course will offer a unique and practical introduction to dispute resolution methods and will equip students with both theoretical and practical understandings of a topic of growing domestic and international significance.In an increasingly globalised world, resorting to courts is not always experienced as a fast and effective way of resolving disputes. The parties may wish to maintain a good working relationship over many years to come, or they may simply not want to commit to a potentially costly, time and resource intensive litigation process with an uncertain outcome. Even more so, if their counterparty is based abroad, the questions of international jurisdiction and enforcement arise and add another layer of difficulty. Alternatively, they may be interested in long-term projects to preserve cash-flow by finding a fast resolution, even if interim.In response to the need for cost-efficient, timely and appropriate dispute resolution, several methods have been developed taking proceedings outside the usual setting of the courtroom. Parties and their advisers ought to be aware of the array of dispute resolution mechanisms, their potential application and features in order to be able to select the tool best suited to their needs. Certain industries, such as the construction industry, use tools, specifically developed to cater for the particularities and needs of the industry. Online dispute resolution has been developed both for the unique online setting but also to aid a speedy and cheap resolution of off-line disputes.This course offers an introduction to a range of dispute resolution mechanisms, their potential application and features and their domestic and international legal framework.",

Appropriate comparisons with the equivalent laws of the member states, in particular those of Germany (the GWB) and the United Kingdom (the Competition Act 1998; the Enterprise Act 2002), will be drawn throughout the course.",

The EU is a complex international actor with a variety of attributed and implied powers and the course will explore the division of competence between the EU and its Member States in relation to economic relations with third countries.  The course will also examine the institutional arrangements within the EU in order to understand the role of the Commission, Council and Parliament in making external economic policy, as well as the role of the Court of Justice of the European Union in shaping this process.  Based upon this knowledge of the inner workings of the EU, the course will turn to consider the different legal instruments and policy tools that are used by the EU in its economic relationships with third countries and how it interacts with international organisations. Specific analysis will be made of 1) the legal foundations for the EU's interaction with the WTO, 2) the legal foundations for the EU's investment policy and handling of investment disputes and 3) the EU's approach to trade and development, in particular the Generalised System of Preferences regime.",

The first group of seminars will address the constitutional foundations of the EU as an actor in international relations, examining both the EU treaties and the relevant case law of the European Court of Justice. The topics that will be covered include: the EU as an international actor with attributed powers; the EU and its Member States on the international scene; and the legal status and effect of international agreements in the EU\u00c2\u00bfs legal order. The second group of seminars will instead consider the legal framework and specific instruments of the EU's external economic relations, starting with the common commercial policy as the oldest and most developed EU external policy, followed by the EU's development cooperation policy as well as the external dimension of the economic and monetary union (EMU). Students will also explore how the EU's external economic policies interact with, and are used to promote the objectives of, other EU policies (such as the common foreign and security policy and environmental policy).",

It provides a relatively brief general overview of the key principles of EU constitutional law before taking an in-depth look at the substantive law of the EU internal market. Today, the EU internal market consists of 28 Member States, comprises 500 million consumers and accounts for roughly 15% of all global imports and exports.The course consists of ten seminars which each address highly topical areas of EU law. The focus shall be on those areas of EU law which are most likely to have a practical impact upon European citizens, consumers and businesses. In so doing, students will gain an understanding of the EU's vast internal market in which the free movement of goods, services, workers and capital is regulated.

    "summary": "EU environmental law is often the source of more than 70% of the Member States national environmental law. Furthermore, EU environmental law covers all the most important areas of environmental policy (waste, water, nature, climate, energy, air, GMOs, chemicals...).  As one may easily conclude from this, EU environmental law is of the utmost importance in Europe. However, the interest of its study goes far beyond European borders.",
    "course_description": "This course aims to explore the competence, instruments and actions of the European Union in environmental matters, focusing on the interactions between its internal and external dimensions. Students' attention will be drawn, on the one hand, to the way in which global commitments influence the development of EU environmental law, and on the other to the ways in which the EU seeks to influence the global protection of the environment. Therefore, the class will be interesting for EU and non-EU students alike.EU environmental law is indeed embedded in a multi-level governance system which involves a multitude of actors (International institutions, Non-Member States, business lobbies, NGOs, etc.). In this context, EU environmental law is both a source and an object of influence for all these actors. As such, it is a fascinating branch of law which opens a reflection on the role that law can play in solving a global issue with local causes in an interconnected political and legal system.This course aims at explaining, questioning and debating EU environmental law potential and limits in the light of this reflection.",

    "summary": "Students will be participating in the European Law Moot Court (ELMC) (https://www.europeanlawmootcourt.eu/).The course accompanies students until the end of the written phase and prepares them for the oral rounds, which - if the students' team is selected - will take place in January or February (the oral round is not part of the course as such).The course requires students to prepare for the written submissions to the moot problem, which will be published on the ELMC website in September.  Students will be split into teams of and must prepare written pleadings both on behalf of the applicant and on behalf of the defendant within the stated rules of the ELMC.The weekly seminars will be used to introduce students to the competition and to mooting; and to mark certain 'milestones' along the way, including: a (formative) presentation early on in the semester allowing for feedback and a decision as to the key arguments to be made; an individually submitted research paper outlining the legal issues and possible solutions (summative 30% of the mark); further meetings in teams to work on advocacy skills (short stand-up preparations) and to prepare a team draft (written submission to the ELMC, which is equally 30% of the summative assessment).  Finally teams will plead their case in different roles in an assessed mock moot court (40% of the summative assessment).",
    "course_description": "1. Academic description:The aim of the course is to enhance student learning in a number of ways:*\tacquisition of practical legal skills by working on a 'real' case*\tacquisition of advocacy skills and the skill to think on their feet when pressed by a judge*\tenhancement of research skills by having to work with unfamiliar aspects of EU law that are not usually covered by standard textbooks thus requiring students to engage in depth with case law and EU legislation*\tencourage students to think strategically and creatively 'like a lawyer'*\ta strong group-work elementThe course thus complements the other courses on the EU Law LLM perfectly.  In terms of course content, it is difficult to predict what the topic of the ELMC will be in any given year. Students will be guided through the experience in 10 seminars which will be primarily used to support students' independent research and to hone their argumentative skills, in particular their oral presentation skills.An exact outline will be presented in the course guide, but the following seminar topics are an indications:1. Introduction to the moot2. Discussion of the moot problem in allocated groups3. Identification of key issues and discussion in class4. Individual presentations on main arguments to be used5. Introduction to mooting and 'stand-up' practice; submission of individual research papers6. Group work on draft briefs7. Peer review and critique of draft arguments8. Small group meetingsThe course will be student-centred and taught interactively.  A key skill students will take from the course is an ability to work autonomously.  Teaching will therefore be partly reactive to students' needs.  It will also ease students into presenting oral argument and defending one's position when challenged.  Hence students will be supported by way of practical skills sessions and feedback sessions on their research and argument.If a student team is selected for the oral rounds, there is naturally no obligation to participate as the oral rounds take place after the course has finished.  Nonetheless students are strongly encouraged to do so and the course organiser will make every effort in getting at least a partial cover of the costs from the School's mooting budget.  This however, cannot be guaranteed.",

We will examine both the legal regulation and the theory behind the practice, and compare different approaches to regulation. Does family law in different jurisdictions seek to achieve the same ends through different means, or are there different ends evident? The very question of whether the state should get involved at all will also be addressed: is family life private life? If the state intervention is justified, should this be at the outset, or during the family life, or at the end of the relationship?",

Marriage and civil partnerships: who may get married or enter into a civil partnership? A comparative review of attitudes towards the state regulation of formally recognised relationships.3. Cohabitation - is it regulated, and in what way? Can a couple contract out of the state regulation of cohabitation?4. Financial provision at the end of a relationship (whether marriage, civil partnership, or cohabitation) - what does it seek to achieve? What should it seek to achieve?5. Forced marriage - regulation and protection across Europe.6. Parental status - who can be a parent? Different ways to create families, including donor conception, surrogacy and adoption.",

The course will also assess the taxonomical debates in comparative legal scholarship through the lens of the main sources of law.  This course thus offers an ideal foundation for students who want to study core areas of private law across both civil and common law jurisdictions.The course is structured in two parts. Part I of the course engages with the aims of the comparative inquiry and explores various methodological approaches placing emphasis on both theory and practical applications. Part II introduces students to the taxonomical debates, the main sources of law in both the common and civil law traditions. It thus allows students to gain an understanding of what can and should be compared, as well as of the challenges and potential pitfalls of the comparative enquiry.",

Indoing so, it will provide a solid grounding not only in argumentation theory, but also in the wide range of legal materials and resources that can be used to run cogent legal arguments, particularly in common law jurisdictions. The course will begin with a detailed look at the Hohfeldian schema for understanding legal entitlements and obligations, demonstrating the ways in which it can be applied in concrete cases and controversies. We will then introduce the propositional and predicate logic necessary to reconstruct arguments with complete clarity, and the different fallacies - formal and informal - that such reconstructions help us bring out. We will then look at legal argument in particular: the role of authority (and different kinds of authority) in generating legal reasons; how to argue when the authority is unclear or contested; and what legal reasons might remain when authority has \"run out\". The reading for each week will be a mixture of the theoretical background to the relevant skills, and a set of excerpts from actual judicial decisions. While there will be time for discussion and debate of the theoretical elements, the core element of each class will consist in the detailed analysis, reconstruction and evaluation of one or more arguments from those decisions. Students will be invited to submit reconstructions in advance, and these too will be discussed in class.",

    "summary": "This course examines the general principles of the substantive criminal law. It focuses in particular on three areas of criminal law doctrine.First, it examines criminal conduct: the kinds of action, omission and harmful results for which one may be held criminally responsible.Second, it examines criminal culpability: intentional and unintentional forms of fault, and the possibility of criminal liability without fault. And third, it examines criminal defences: justifying and excusing factors that defeat criminal liability. Throughout, the course also considers the application of these principles to problematic cases, and to particular areas of the law (such as the law of homicide).In examining these issues, the course does not adopt the perspective of any single jurisdiction. Rather, it adopts a more general approach: examining issues that arise across different legal systems and traditions, and across different areas of the criminal law. To shed light on these issues, the course also introduces students to insights from comparative and theoretical criminal law scholarship.",
    "course_description": "This course examines the general principles of criminal law: the principles that govern criminal liability in general, across different types and families of offence. It does not introduce these principles, or the legal rules relating to them, from the perspective of any single jurisdiction. Rather, as an advanced-level course for postgraduate students, it adopts a broader perspective: it tackles issues that are important across jurisdictional boundaries, and in different legal traditions. The course examines different ways of resolving these issues. It considers the results that these different approaches would yield when applied to particular cases and areas of the law. It also encourages students to think critically about the doctrines examined, and to consider how the criminal law might be developed or reformed.More specifically, the course examines the following aspects of criminal law doctrine:\u00c2\u00bb Criminal conduct: the objective or 'actus reus' elements of criminal offences. Topics include the kinds of conduct for which one may be held criminally responsible (such as acts, omissions and states of affairs); and liability for the harmful results of that conduct.\u00c2\u00bb Criminal culpability: the fault, subjective or 'mens rea' elements of criminal offences. Topics include varieties of criminal intention; varieties of unintentional fault, such as recklessness and negligence; and the possibility of liability without fault, as in cases of strict and constructive liability.\u00c2\u00bb Criminal defences: factors that defeat liability for criminal offences. The course focuses particularly on exculpatory defences: justifications (or denials of wrongdoing) and excuses (or denials of culpability).The course is taught through seminars. Reading lists will be provided for each seminar; students are expected to prepare by completing these in advance. Students are also expected to participate actively in seminar discussion. Seminars will not generally include lectures or long presentations from staff; rather, students will learn primarily through reflective and critical discussion of the seminar topics and readings. Students will also complete a final assessed essay, which will involve critical analysis and evaluation of a topic or group of topics from the course.",

    "course_description": "Since the drafting of the Genocide Convention in 1948, the crime of genocide has lost none of its significance. Charges of genocide have been made in relation to a wide range of situations, including the killings in Cambodia and ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, the massacres in Rwanda and the crimes committed against the Yazidis in Iraq. But the legal evaluation is often surprising: in the case of Cambodia, the genocide findings of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia did not deal with the Cambodian victims of the Khmer Rouge, and the question whether ethnic cleansing is a form of genocide, divides academics and practitioners to this day.'Genocide and the Law' will introduce students to the main situations in which international law has dealt with genocide, will involve debates and moot presentations on the topic and offer insight into the main controversies surrounding the phenomenon which the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda has called 'the crime of crimes'.Indicative Teaching Programme:Teaching on this course will be done through 10 weekly seminars of 2 hours each. The seminars will be taught by Dr Paul Behrens.Seminar 1 \u00c2\u00bb The concept of genocideSeminar 2 \u00c2\u00bb The protection of groupsSeminar 3 \u00c2\u00bb The commission of genocideSeminar 4 \u00c2\u00bb 'Basic' Mens Rea and Modes of PerpetrationSeminar 5 \u00c2\u00bb Specific genocidal intent (1)Seminar 6 \u00c2\u00bb Specific genocidal intent (2)Seminar 7 \u00c2\u00bb Incitement to genocideSeminar 8 \u00c2\u00bb Genocide and State Responsibility (1)Seminar 9 \u00c2\u00bb Genocide and State Responsibility (2)Seminar 10 \u00c2\u00bb Genocide todayA range of different teaching methods is envisaged for these seminars. There will be more traditional lecture segments during which students will be introduced to particular issues in the field of the law of genocide, but there will also be seminar questions, especially on leading controversies, which will be discussed with the class as a whole. A further teaching method will be the holding of moots. For that purpose students will be sorted into two groups and be given a moot problem to prepare. They will have to argue different sides of the relevant problem and must be able to answer questions arising from their relevant presentations.",

Through the joint preparation of the mooting sessions, they will take responsibility not only for their own work, but also for the work of others.Skills and Abilities in Communication:Oral communication is developed through debates on salient questions relating to the law of genocide throughout the course and the use of mooting presentations delivered by members of the seminar group at appropriate junctures. Students will thus learn to communicate efficiently with their peers and undertake critical evaluation of the arguments advanced by each side. Written communication will be developed in particular through the students' work on the formative and the summative assessment.Skills and Abilities in Personal Effectiveness:Students will learn to effectively assess elements of the law of genocide but also the impact that other areas of the law (e.g. human rights, State responsibility) have on this field. They will be able to enhance their  personal effectiveness in the seminar sessions where the arguments which they will have prepared, will be  tested by a peer group and where they will also have the opportunity to compare the validity of their points to that made by other students.",

Seminars and assessment will be designed to encourage students to access a range of sources and to synthesise these in understanding particular forms of international and transnational crime. Students are encouraged to select particular cases or problems to which they then apply learning from the course to come up with original analyses. The field is characterised by sketchy and often contentious evidence, and students are encouraged to deal with this, seeking creative solutions where possible and limiting conclusions where necessary.Communication skillsStudents are expected to communicate appropriately with peers and experts in seminars which are predominantly based around discussions and group tasks. High level communication skills are developed through the use of journal-style assessments. Critical engagement with quantitative data sources is focused in one particular session on measurement but also runs throughout a number of other sessions.Autonomy, accountability and working with othersStudents develop autonomy through preparation for seminars and assessments where, beyond a core minimum, they are expected to direct their own reading, and define their approach to questions, selection of cases and examples. Group work in seminars encourages the development of peer working, including exercising leadership in groups, working as part of a team to effectively realise goals and producing outputs that enjoy group support and consensus.",

Second, we will look  in detail at a range of military activities and analyse the relevant human rights law.  This will include a consideration of lethal and non-lethal targeting, detention operations and air and maritime warfare.  It will further consider a careful analysis of the right to life, freedom from cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and torture, and the right to liberty.  Third, we will analyse the obligations on states to investigate alleged human rights law violations during armed conflict and the enforcement of human rights law.  Finally, through an analysis of recent armed conflicts, we will consider the extent to which human rights law can impact the military effectiveness of armed forces and what, if anything, states can do to limit the effect of human rights law. Throughout the course we will consider both the theoretical legal framework applicable to armed conflict and the practical consequences of the application of a state\u00c2\u00bfs human rights law obligations.",

    "summary": "Technology law students increasingly need higher levels of understanding of computing, and this course explores a domain of computer science called human-computer interaction (HCI). It questions what lessons we can learn from this field for technology law and governance.This short 10-credit course presents a range of methodological and substantive topics to broaden law students' skill sets beyond traditional legal modes of inquiry. This is complemented by utilising novel use cases of cutting-edge technologies to ground class discussions in emerging real life governance problems. We will also reflect on practices of designers and what opportunities there are for addressing legal, cultural, design and social harms in their work.This has the benefit of introducing students to (a) new ways of thinking about what technology designers do; (b) new methods and approaches they can take back into their own legal work; (c) an opportunities to engage with new applications being developed in HCI research to understand better how we live ethically and legally with technology.",
    "course_description": "The course will be taught by five weekly seminars, where students are introduced to new substantive and methodological tools. Example topics include discussions around legal design, value sensitive and participatory design, usability, designing for consent, and qualitative, quantitative and creative evaluation methods. The course also considers emerging technologies  and regulatory challenges for design, such as accessibility, affective computing, tangible computing, artificial intelligence and, the Internet of Things.1. Introduction to user-centric design and user experience (UX) for lawyers;2. Human and legal values in design;3. Evaluation methods in HCI;4. Thinking critically about HCI:5.

We will consider a wide variety of hard regulatory questions posed by impacts of emerging information technologies. These systems are often changing, adapting, and shifting, meaning regulation in this domain does too. This creates a policy and legal landscape that is often in a state of flux but also gives us a wide range of case studies, examples, and legal frameworks to consider in this course.Each week we will explore and analyse interesting questions about the socio-technical risks and harms posed by specific new technologies, the merits and demerits of different regulatory strategies, and the role law plays in shaping how these technologies impact our everyday lives.The course engages with fundamental questions around how to regulate IT from ongoing debates over the past 25 years, since the inception of the field, through to cutting edge concerns.The course brings together perspectives from a wide variety of areas of law including intellectual property, privacy, and data protection. It also explores a variety of jurisdictions, particularly UK, EU, and international levels. The course also situates these legal debates in their wider social context by introducing students to socio-legal, technical, sociological, and design aspects of information technologies.We will cover cutting edge areas including online mediated work in the gig economy; governing machine learning and artificial intelligence systems; online platform liability and content moderation; data protection and privacy aspects of web and smart technologies such as smart homes; the role of cloud and edge computing; and strategies for addressing cybercrime and cybersecurity.",

    "course_description": "The aims of this course are to:1. Highlight the institutional framework in which policy is formulated and law developed in the areas of copyright and design rights and related rights in the UK;2. Consider the impact of international and European policy making on the scope of these rights in the UK;3. Explore how copyright, design rights and related rights may be infringed in the UK;4. Consider the interests that the law protects and investigate the extent to which it is successful in balancing those interests.The purpose of this course is to consider the law relating to the specific IP rights outlined in the description above. As such, the course focusses on the substantive law in the UK in relation to such IP rights and students are expected to read and fully engage with doctrinal literature/black letter law (primary materials in the form of statutes, directives case law), in addition to legal scholarship in the area.This course is taught at Masters level and the emphasis is on student participation. The format for each session is the same: students are provided with reading materials in advance of the class which they should have read and thought about before attending.During teaching sessions students are expected to contribute to discussion and to take responsibility for their own learning. The reading materials which are referred to are by no means exhaustive and students are encouraged to undertake independent research.The seminars will involve discussion and contribution by students and a significant level of preparation, research and contribution is expected.While assessments will normally reflect the topics covered in seminars, it is your responsibility to undertake independent research to enhance and deepen your learning. Merely studying materials covered in seminars is unlikely to result in a high mark.It is emphasised that Intellectual property law is a broad ranging subject and the reading lists that will be provided with each session's handouts will only represent a fraction of the material that is available on any topic. Students undertaking the course will be expected to carry out independent work for their assignments, over and beyond the issues and materials discussed in the seminars.",

This course will examine in detail the law on subsistence/entitlement to protection, infringement and defences for all of the relevant rights, alongside discussion of wider policy, economic and other considerations.The sessions will also highlight areas of particular topicality.",
    "course_description": "The purpose of this course is to consider the law relating to the specific IP rights outlined in the description above.  As such, the course focusses on the substantive law in relation to such IP rights and students are expected to read and fully engage with doctrinal/black letter law (primary materials in the form of statutes, directives case law) in addition to legal scholarship in the area.This course is taught at Masters level and the emphasis is on student participation.  The format for each session is the same: the students are provided with reading materials in advance of the class which they should have read and thought about before attending.  During teaching sessions, students are expected to contribute to discussions and to take responsibility for their own learning.  The reading materials which are referred to are by no means exhaustive and students are encouraged to undertake independent research.The seminars will involve discussion and contribution by students and a significant level of preparation, research and contribution is expected.While assessments will normally reflect the topics covered in seminars, it is your responsibility to undertake independent research to enhance and deepen your learning.  Merely studying the materials covered in seminars is unlikely to result in a high mark.It is emphasised that intellectual property law is a broad ranging subject and the reading lists that will be provided with each sessions's handouts will only represent a fraction of the material that is available on any topic.  Students undertaking the course will be expected to carry out independent work for their assignments over and beyond the issues and materials discussed in the seminars.",

    "summary": "Intellectual Property laws are often associated with the aims of promoting 'innovation' and 'creativity'. But how do Intellectual Property laws actually impact upon innovation and creativity? Do they promote or hinder them? What is the relationship between Intellectual Property Laws and the variety of activities that they are designed to affect in everyday life? Are there gaps between what Intellectual Property laws aim to achieve and what they actually achieve? Why do these gaps exist and how can they be filled? How should Intellectual Property policy be formulated? This course explores these questions by examining a selection of recent empirical legal research that has investigated the role and impact of IP rights in the 'real world'.",
    "course_description": "This is an advanced course in Intellectual Property rights that provides students with an inter-disciplinary perspective on Intellectual property. In terms of theme, the course's focus is on the relationship between Intellectual Property laws and innovation and creativity. In terms of substance, the course centres on several empirical studies that will enable students to gain an awareness of the perceptions and implications of IP law in the real world in relation to the theme of innovation and creativity. These studies will provide students insights into the application and role of IP rights (copyright, patents, and trade marks) for various stakeholders, i.e. creators and inventors, rights owners, users, the general public and the public interest. They will offer fresh, challenging, and surprising, accounts of how IP is understood, used, abused, valued, feared, resisted, or ignored in everyday experiences. Students will learn to read, understand, de-construct, and critically evaluate empirical studies on the relationship between IP rights, innovation and creativity. They will also learn to assimilate themes emerging from across such studies to develop their own views and evaluation of whether, and if so how, IP promotes or hinders innovation and creativity. The course complement and adds to the legal knowledge that students may have from other masters courses on legal and international aspects of IP law (or have acquired from previous knowledge, studies, or experience of IP law) by providing them with an additional empirical 'real-world lens' on the role and value of IP rights. This knowledge and perspective can be quite valuable to future career pathways in practice, policy-making, or academia.",

    "summary": "Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) affect various aspects of our lives including health, education, agriculture, politics, communications, privacy, and the environment. The globalization of IPRs (especially after its linkage with international trade) in recent decades has equally led to inevitable tensions and conflicts between IPRs and human rights in both developed and developing countries. Historically, the fields of IP and Human Rights evolved independently, but there is now an increasing recognition of the relationship between both fields and this has equally led to debates concerning the proper conceptualization of the relationship between IP and Human Rights.This module will examine the nature and significance of the relationship between IP and Human Rights. There will be an exploration of the various tensions resulting from the interaction between IP and Human Rights and an examination of how these tensions are being addressed at national, regional, and global levels. In this regard, the module will examine how traditional IPRs (such as patents, copyright and trademarks) interact and impact civil and political rights (such as freedom of expression and privacy) and economic and social rights. Other forms of IPRs, such as image rights and how they impact human rights will also be studied. In addition, there will be an analysis of the issues pertaining to indigenous peoples and the protection of their traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions from a human rights perspective.",

    "summary": "The title for the course is \u00c2\u00bfIntergenerational transfer of wealth\u00c2\u00bf, because the course will not merely focus on what legal systems understand to be formally part of their respective succession laws, but will extend, for instance, to instruments that lie outside its domain but that obtain succession objectives. Also, the course will look at lifetime transfers that are informed by succession objectives. In other words, students are invited to take a functional perspective.The approach taken will be historical, comparative and, to some extent, also inter-disciplinary. Students would gain an understanding of the principles and policies underlying the transfer of wealth on death. They will study how wealth is distributed on death, to whom, why, and by what means, but also how socio-economic factors have influenced the development of the law in this area and what challenges succession law is facing in light of developments in other areas of the law (eg property law, family law, insolvency law, tax law), as well as demographic changes.This course will be divided into two parts. The first part of the course will focus on the basic principles and foundations of succession law, dealing with topics such as the scope and boundaries of succession law, its functions and place on the map of private law, the philosophical foundations underpinning private succession as well as the scope of private autonomy in this context, and thus testamentary freedom and its restrictions.By contrast, the second part will deal with key challenges and debates in succession law that are caused, for instance, by the rise of will-substitutes, digital assets, an ageing society (the vulnerable testator) as well as an increase in cross-border succession cases.",

    "summary": "This course will offer a unique and practical introduction to international commercial arbitration and will equip students with both theoretical and practical understandings of a topic of growing international significance.In response to the need for cost-efficient, timely and appropriate dispute resolution, several methods have been developed taking proceedings outside the usual setting of the courtroom. Perhaps the most popular and successful of these (in the field of international trade) is international commercial arbitration.The law and practice of international commercial arbitration seeks to find solutions which fit the needs of international business. The aim is to provide a neutral process acceptable to both parties to a transaction, one which minimises the risks of forum shopping and avoids the problems of conflicts over legal forum and applicable law, one which is commercial and sensitive to commercial needs.International commercial arbitration is a creature of agreement and cannot operate without the consent of the parties. Nonetheless the system cannot operate without legal regulation and a considerable body of law has developed as the process becomes more popular.The law in question deals with issues such as how national legal systems regulate arbitration, give effect to arbitration agreements and enforce the decisions of arbitrators. Additionally there is a considerable amount of 'soft' law, dealing with matters of how the process should operate and best practice for parties, counsel and arbitrators.The course will focus on this body of law and how it operates in practical situations. The course will focus largely on international law and practice, with domestic and national solutions used mainly as examples of a developing international practice.",

    "summary": "This course deals with one of the youngest and most dynamic branches of international law: the law that pertains to offences against the international community. The first part of the course deals with 'general' international criminal law' (history of international criminal law, its sources and institutions, and the general part of the substantial law). The second part discusses major crime categories which today constitute the substantial part of international criminal law: genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The second part also contains a discussion of the future of international criminal law and alternatives to the judicial system..",
    "course_description": "Teaching is by seminars and by independent research and discussion.Student presentations form an integral part of the course (see below, Student Assessment and Guidance). Each seminar is dedicated to a specific subject area of international criminal law.First Part (first semester):The first part offers an introduction to international criminal law and discusses general questions of State jurisdiction over international crimes. It investigates the question whether there is a need for international criminal justice and explores the history of the subject area, with a particular emphasis on the trial of the major war criminals at Nuremberg. A further section is dedicated to the institutions of international criminal law that came into existence post Nuremberg, in particular, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the International Criminal Court, but also the so-called 'hybrid' or 'third generation' tribunals. It further deals with the principles and sources of international criminal law today and thus investigates principles such as 'nullum crimen sine lege' and 'in dubio pro reo' and their impact on the interpretation of international criminal law today.Following the examination of these points which establish the framework for contemporary international criminal justice, the structure of international crimes is being discussed and critically assessed. That includes seminars on the principle of personal liability and the actus reus of the crime, including the contextual element and its particular position within the statutes of international criminal courts and tribunals today. It also includes an exploration of the mens rea and focuses in particular on the threepartite system which the Statute of the International Criminal Court in this regard envisages (mens rea referring to conduct, circumstances and consequences). Further discussions deal with grounds for the exclusion of criminal responsibility, with a particular focus on the defences of superior orders and duress, which have played a certain role in the application of international criminal justice to date. The course also deals with modes of perpetration, inchoate crimes, omissions and bars to the prosecution of international crimes.Second Part (second semester)The main part of the second semester will be dedicated to a discussion of the principal crime categories which are recognised in international criminal law today.That includes genocide as a crime whose codification took place only in relatively recent history. The course will thus deal with the constituent elements of the crime and the question in how far they differentiate the crime from, eg, crimes against humanity. This includes a discussion of groups that are protected under the Genocide Convention and of the existence of a contextual element for this crime. Further topics include the position of specific genocidal intent (including the substantiality requirement of genocide and the concept of 'destruction'), as well as 'associated' forms of genocide (such as incitement to the crime).Crimes against humanity form the second category under discussion. The contextual element,  in particular, the requirement of an attack on a civilian population and the aspect of 'policy' forms an important part of the examination. Particular crimes will be discussed in more detail - in past years, these have included torture and enslavement, sexual crimes and persecutions.The course further deals with war crimes as the oldest recognised category of international crimes. It thus reflects on the history of the crime and its development in domestic criminal law, but also on the impact of international humanitarian law on the evolution of war crimes. The basis of the discussions of this crime category is the Statute of the International Criminal Court, and particular focus emphasis is placed on the distinction that is made within this treaty between international and internal armed conflicts. Particular war crimes which are discussed in more detail, have in the past included attacks on undefended cities, plunder of public or private property, mistreatment of prisoners of war and the recruitment or enlistment of child soldiers.Further sections of the course are dedicated to the most recent crime category (the crime of aggression) and to its elements (including the question whether the crime includes a 'leadership' element), but also to an investigation of the viability of prosecutions for that crime in light of the safeguards which had been agreed by the international community. The course also reflects on alternatives to international criminal justice and thus discusses truth and reconciliation commission, gacaca courts and other ways of dealing with the aftermath of international crimes.",

The precise content of the subjects addressed in semester two will vary from year to year, depending upon contemporary developments in international environmental law, but they will tend to address key issues relating to the regulation of hazardous substances, the conservation of biological diversity, the role of human rights in environmental protection, and the interaction between international environmental law and international economic law.",

    "course_description": "The International Intellectual Property System (IIPS) began developing in the 19th Century in response to the then advances in cross-border trade. As intellectual property laws are territorial, so some mechanism had to be found through which protection could be accorded to authors and inventors as their works were traded abroad. The response, over the ensuing 150 years, was the establishment of a number of international bodies responsible for the development and oversight of a variety of Treaties and Agreements providing both formal and substantive norms which were (and are) in turn translated into domestic law. These measures have had a significant impact on the shape of domestic intellectual property laws, the development of which has quickened with the growth in international trade coupled with innovative technological advances. However, there are significant tensions within the system. Many of these have been brought about through the incorporation of intellectual property into international trade law via the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement).This module will examine the IIPS mainly from a legal perspective. However, policy and institutional perspectives will also be considered. Crucially, the course aims to train students to think critically about intellectual property within the context of international law. In this regard, the international rules for the protection of different types of intellectual property rights (such as copyright, patent rights, and trademarks) will be critically examined. Moreover, the international institutions where these rules are made and administered (such as the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the World Trade Organisation) will also be considered. Importantly, a major theme that will run through the entire course is a critical examination of the policy space available to states under international intellectual property law. Furthermore, apart from studying some of the key treaties and cases in the field of international intellectual property law, students will also critically examine the interface between international intellectual property law and other areas of international law such as international trade law and international investment law.Sessions will cover the following topics:- The historical development of, and the institutions involved in, the IIPS- The principles of, and tensions, within the IIPS- The TRIPS Agreement- International Copyright Law- International Patent Law- International Trademark Law- International rules for the enforcement of intellectual property rights- The national security exception- The investor-state dispute system and the IIPS- Traditional knowledge, traditional cultural expressions, and the IIPS",

The focus of study is the rules contained in the network of more than 3000 bilateral and multilateral treaties on investment protection, as well as the growing number of decisions by arbitral tribunals in this field.  Students will analyse the substantive principles of investment law, such as most-favoured nation treatment, fair and equitable treatment, and the rules relating to expropriation. They will also study mechanisms for dispute settlement in the context of investment disputes, particularly investor-state arbitration.  Throughout the course, students will consider the extent to which international investment law draws an appropriate balance between investment protection on the one hand and the ability of states to regulate on key public policy issues on the other hand. Students will also look at the challenges of developing a coherent regime of investment rules.",

The precise content of the course will vary from year to year in order to reflect the changing challenges within the law of the sea but it may cover issues such as the implications of sea-level rise for maritime boundaries and limits, the constraints of coastal state jurisdiction over foreign ships in the territorial sea and the exclusive economic zone, delimitation of overlapping maritime zones and the management of activities in disputed maritime areas, the regulation of new technologies within the marine environment, and the scope of jurisdiction and applicable law under the dispute settlement regime set up by Part XV of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. In particular, students will be expected to engage with the evolving case law emanating from international courts and tribunals dealing with law of the sea disputes, as well as considering how the law may need to be reformed in order to address contemporary challenges.",

    "course_description": "1. Freedom of Speech vs. Freedom of the MediaThis seminar will introduce the students to key international human rights conventions and the emerging practice relating to freedom of expression in the digital domain. They will also be encouraged to take a comparative approach and consider the level of protection offered the media in their own countries.  In particular they will be asked to consider:i) Do we need specific protection for the media beyond protection for freedom of speech? To what extent do international human rights guarantees bind private entities as well as states and do they impose positive as well as negative obligations?ii) Who should be entitled to legal protection?  Is there, for instance a difference between individuals/citizens journalist/ bloggers and professional media outlets and, in the latter case, who enjoys protection: the publisher, the editor, the journalists? Are there reasons to be more tolerant of content regulation re some media than others?2. Regulatory Tools in the Context of Convergence and GlobalisationThis seminar will consider the 'regulatory toolbox; in the media field, drawing in particular on the work of Lawrence Lessig. We will consider whether the traditional rationales for media policy and regulation still apply and the scope for technologically-neutral regulation.  We encourage the students to develop 'value chains' for various media industries to understand the nature of the production process and the pressure points where regulation may be applied.3. Structural Regulation I:  Media Markets and PluralismThis seminar will explore the basic elements of media economics and market structure: what is driving consolidation in media markets?  Is intervention still required given the online information cornucopia?  We will consider how concentration can be measured and the legitimacy of intervention to promote plurality and diversity:  is competition law sufficient? Particular attention will be given to the US attempt to create a workable 'diversity index' and the WTO China Audiovisual Entertainment Products ruling.4. Structural Regulation II: From Public Service Broadcasting to Public Service MediaWhat were the original rationales for public service broadcasting and what guidance is there at the international level for state support for public service media in the digital age? We will encourage the students to experiment with time-lines to plot show key stages in the evolution of this concept.  The seminar will consider PSB models in a comparative perspective and the controversial nature of state aid regulation in the EU context.  Could PSB be problematic also from a WTO perspective?5. Content regulation I: Media Imperialism, Cultural Diversity and World TradeThis seminar considers the controversy over media imperialism, with particular reference to the idea of a new world information order and the attempts by the EU to promote European and independent audiovisual production. To what extent are these initiatives designed to pursue cultural or purely economic objectives?  It also examines the role of the WTO and UNESCO in addressing the question of the free flow of media content, focusing in particular on the application of GATT and GATS and the Canada Periodicals ruling.6. Content regulation II: limitations to free speechIn this seminar we will examine the legitimacy of restrictions on freedom of expression in order to protect individuals from harm or achieve other social objectives. The topic may vary to take into account current developments. For example, at the moment fake news is particularly in the news with concerns over political advertising and covid information, though in other years other topics may come to the fore. The seminar will consider how opposing interest are evaluated and the principles employed. How can states maintain their own standards in an increasingly international environment?7. Content Regulation III: The Regulation of IntermediariesTo what extent are the major platforms, search engines and social media companies responsible, or should be responsible, for the content on their sites?  In this seminar we will consider the approach that has been adopted in the past by the EU in the Electronic Commerce Directive and proposed changes in the Digital Services Act.8. Content regulation IV: media freedom vs privacyWe will explore the potential conflict between the public\u00c2\u00bfs right to know and the individual\u00c2\u00bfs right to be \u00c2\u00bfleft alone\u00c2\u00bf. We will consider the central role of the ECtHR in developing European principles in this area and the role of the EU in developing the right to be forgotten.9. Content regulation V: politically-compelled speechThis final seminar will consider the nature of 'government speech', the regulation of electoral campaigns; including the fairness doctrine and equal-time rules; and the case of 'diversity quotas'.10. Review Session and Skills EvaluationIn this final session we will return to some of the main themes of the course and identify the knowledge and skills that you have been developing in your study.",

What is the EU Grundnorm? Has the Court overstepped the authority of international treaties?- does the Court give carte blanche to the EU institutions?- have the remedies recognised by the Court of Justice any real basis in law?- is the declaratory power under Article 264 compatible with any known division of powers?- judicial autonomy of national courts; does the Court require too much of them?- is there/ought there to be a common front amongst the constitutional courts of the member states?

Its basis is the treatment which minorities defined by gender identity and sexual orientation have received in human rights law, with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights and of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights being particularly important sources. In selected case studies, the course will also deal with the way in which domestic laws have implemented LGBT rights or have provided adopted a restrictive stance on matters relating to sexual minorities. The topics under discussion include criminalisation and decriminalisation of same-sex activities, anti-discrimination legislation, same-sex marriages and same-sex unions, transgender rights and the law relating to conversion practices. At the end of the course students are expected to have obtained insight into the way in which courts have interpreted human rights instruments to protect rights that are not expressly mentioned in them, to have developed the ability to critically examine some of the leading controversies in the field of LGBT rights and to be able to compare approaches that domestic laws have taken on salient issues relating to the protection of sexual minorities.",

Throughout the debates in the course, students should develop critical analytical skills with regard in particular to the main controversies that the recognition and implementation of LGBT rights involve.2. Skills and abilities in personal and intellectual autonomy are promoted in particular through the independent preparatory work that students have to carry out in advance of each seminar (in particular in relation to the individual seminar questions which will be provided).  Through group discussions, they will take responsibility not only for their own work, but also for the work of others.3. Oral communication is developed through debates on salient questions relating to LGBT rights throughout the course and the use of group work at appropriate junctures. Students will thus learn to communicate efficiently with their peers and undertake critical evaluation of the arguments advanced by each side. Written communication will be developed in particular through the students' work on the formative and the summative assessment.4. Students will learn to effectively assess elements of the law relating to LGBT rights, including their adoption and implementation on the domestic stage; but also to evaluate the interaction between human rights which protect LGBT persons with other human rights. They will be able to enhance their personal effectiveness in the seminar sessions where the arguments which they will have prepared, will be tested by a peer group and where they will also have the opportunity to compare the validity of their points to that made by other students.5. In the course of the seminars, students will learn to solve problems utilising the knowledge gained from the various seminars and work effectively as part of a group towards this end.",

Students will also gain understanding of these phenomena from a normative point of view, identifying features of these mental processes that are valuable either because they are instrumental to the production of better decisions or because they embody a valuable principle or value. In order to do so, students will (a) gain understanding about the mechanisms by which such mental states might be conductive to better decisions and (b) be introduced to normative resources drawn from the current literature on both Virtue Epistemology and Virtue Ethics.",

This course explores various approaches to how to understand what someone says when they use language and how those approaches apply in a wide range of legal contexts. The first part of the course draws on linguistics and philosophy of language to develop a theoretical framework for determining the content that we express by using language. The second part then looks at how to apply that framework in various legal contexts. These include how to understand various types of legal instrument \u00c2\u00bf legislation and written constitutions, international treaties, and private legal instruments (such as contracts, leases, and wills) \u00c2\u00bf and other legally-relevant uses of language: statements that may be defamatory, or misrepresentations (or false descriptions), or that may involve hate speech (or incitements to violence), etc. Students will therefore improve both their understanding of how language works and their ability to make persuasive argument about how to interpret language use in various legal contexts.",

    "summary": "Artificial Intelligence has the potential to change the way law operates - and with that also the future of the law firm Some commentators, prominent amongst them Richard Susskind, have anticipated for decades major changes in the 'value chain' that law firms produce. This course introduces key technologies that have the potential to impact on the way lawyers operate in practice, with a focus on the issue of digital evidence and computer forensics.",
    "course_description": "The purpose of the course is thus also to provide an introduction to the legal aspects of forensic computing investigations, and to offer an overview of legislation and the main legal issues related to cyber-crime and computer forensics.Digital forensics is not just a problem for IT law. In most criminal investigations, some pieces of evidence will be in a digital format \u00c2\u00bf photos from smartphones, geo-location data from a car's satnav or simply CCTV footage. Despite its importance for practice however, the distinctive features of evidence in digital form are often poorly understood by defence lawyers, prosecutors and judges alike. This can obviously create problems for the administration of justice. Party advocates struggle to transform the evidence collected by the computer forensic experts into a 'narrative' that convinces the jury, or fail to scrutinise sufficiently the evidence submitted by the opposing party. Judges in turn sometimes struggle to 'quality control' the way in which the evidence enters the court, evaluate its weight when sitting as single decision makers, or oversee, where the jurisdiction provides such, the issuing of warrants in the investigative process.This course will equip students with a grounding in the technical aspects of forensic computing that will enable them to perform these roles better, and also introduce them to the main legal issues that this technology raises. Prior knowledge of computer science is not required, and the course will not make students into computer forensic investigators. Rather, it introduces, in a co-ordinated way, both computer science and legal issues regarding electronic evidence, to better prepare lawyers in their dealing with evidence in digital form.",

    "course_description": "The course will consist in a series (10) of weekly topics on the Learn platform; these will cover a set of topics in Mental Health Law. The intention will be to begin by introducing some basic concepts, such as mental capacity, and build on this to discuss the extensive legislative provisions in place in the UK jurisdictions, as well as the impact on individuals where they experience a mental health diagnosis. Discussion will take place on Learn, based on set topics and questions.Ten (10) weekly online topics:Topic 1: IntroductionThis seminar will outline the course and provider a historical overview of mental health law provision. Reference will also be made to the use of relevant terminology, as well as issues such as statutory guardianship, the parens patriae jurisdiction, human rights and best interests.Topic 2: The Legislative Framework in the UKThis seminar will identify, compare and contrast mental health and capacity laws in the four UK jurisdictions.Topic 3: Key InstitutionsThis seminar will consider the roles of relevant institutions in mental health law. This includes the Courts generally, the (former) Court of Protection, the Law Society and Law Society of Scotland, Parliament and devolved ministrations, Public Guardian, and Official Solicitor.Topic 4: Mental health, capacity and best interestsThis seminar will consider the relationship between best interests and mental health, focusing in particular on medical treatment for mental health conditions and in respect of health conditions not related to a patient's mental health.Topic 5: \tCapacity and sexual relationshipsThis seminar will comprise a continuation of Seminar 4 and conclude with a segue into the subject of mental health and criminal responsibility.Topic 6: The 'Fusion' Legislation ApproachThe 'fusion' approach involves combining mental capacity and mental health laws. It is an approach which has recently been adopted in Northern Ireland and is currently in the process of being implemented in that UK jurisdiction. It has also been considered as a way forward in reforming the Mental Health Act 1983 (England & Wales). An examination of the fusion approach will form the basis for considering broader conceptual issues around how mental health is defined and characterised in policy and legal discourse, and will provide an important springboard for the subsequent examination of the relationship between mental health and human rights in Seminars 9 and 10.Topic 7: Mental health and deprivation of libertyThis seminar will focus on the human rights implications of Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) schemes in the UK. The issue of DoLS would already have been touched upon earlier in the course but this seminar would build on that to examine the seminal UK Supreme Court judgment in Cheshire West (criteria for judging whether the living arrangements made for a mentally incapacitated person amount to a deprivation of liberty); how it has been applied in the UK jurisdictions; how DoLS has been interpreted in the Court of Protection in England & Wales; and the operation of the new Liberty Protection Safeguards scheme in England & Wales.Topic 8: The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with DisabilitiesThis seminar will focus on an examination of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and its relationship with existing UK mental health and capacity legislation, as well as the UK's non-compliance with the Convention. A particular focus of examination will be on Article 12 CRPD, exploring the notion of legal capacity and the supported decision-making model.Topic 9: Mental Health and Criminal Justice IPolicy perspectives in relation to mental health and crime (links to previous week's discussion of legislatures; the relationships between mental disorder and crime; and understanding responses to mentally disordered offenders, including in the media.Topic 10: Mental Health and Criminal Justice IICurrent psychiatric defences and contemporary mental health disposals and services, including relations with victims of mentally disordered offenders.",

    "course_description": "IntroductionFrom women\u00c2\u00bfs and LGBTQI* rights to disability rights, from environmental protection to education and housing, many social justice battles have been and continue to be fought in courts. This course explores how the construction of European law has been a story of legal mobilisation. It investigates how European law is \u00c2\u00bfmobilised\u00c2\u00bf when the \u00c2\u00bfdesire or want\u00c2\u00bf of legal entrepreneurs \u00c2\u00bfis translated into a demand as an assertion of one's rights\u00c2\u00bf (Zemans, 1983).Taking a step back from traditional \u00c2\u00bflaw in the books\u00c2\u00bf approaches, students will revisit the construction of European law from a \u00c2\u00bflaw in action\u00c2\u00bf perspective and interrogate the \u00c2\u00bfmaking\u00c2\u00bf of key areas of European law. They will examine the relationship between law, social change and social justice through key questions: Who are the actors that utilize legal avenues strategically to advance social causes and trigger societal reform (civil society, interest groups, legal professionals, etc.)? What are the interests and strategies behind the construction of key European law cases, legislation and policies? What legal opportunities and context condition the success or failure of the mobilisation of European law?Learning objectivesOn completion of this course, students will be able to:\u00c2\u00bf\tCritically analyse the relationship between law, social change and social justice;\u00c2\u00bf\tRecognise, research and explain legal mobilisation strategies behind European case law, legislation and policies in key areas including equality and non-discrimination law, migration law, consumer protection, environmental protection\u00c2\u00bf;\u00c2\u00bf\tRead and analyse European case law, legislation and policies through the lens of key socio-legal theories and notions including:o\tConcepts such as framing, cause lawyering, social change, public interest lawyering, social movements, legal and rights consciousness;o\tTypes of legal mobilisation in Europe and the role of legal opportunities in defining avenues and strategies;o\tActors of legal mobilisation in Europe, their interests and agenda: national institutions, private organisations, NGOs, CSOs; law firms and EU organs;\u00c2\u00bf\tConduct socio-legal research and apply socio-legal research methodologies to effectively construct, articulate, present and defend elaborate legal arguments both orally and in writing;\u00c2\u00bf\tStrengthen reading, research and writing skills, synthesise and construct legal arguments from a wide range of interdisciplinary sources and effectively work with peers.Course rationaleThe course responds to a growing interest in the research community and draws from an expanding body of literature shedding light on the conditions in which European law is \u00c2\u00bfmanufactured\u00c2\u00bf (Nicola and Davies, 2017). This course flips mainstream perspectives on European law and proposes to study European law \u00c2\u00bfin the making\u00c2\u00bf and from an interdisciplinary standpoint, integrating research from political sciences, sociology and legal history. The novelty, originality and practical dimension of this course is that it tackles various \u00c2\u00bftraditional\u00c2\u00bf European law subjects such as equality, consumer protection, migration and environmental protection but displaces the lens of inquiry onto the actors, strategies, conditions and context behind the key decisions and legislation that \u00c2\u00bfmade\u00c2\u00bf European law in each area.While focusing on EU law, the course also offers comparative insights into the ECHR system and introduces examples from the US history of public interest lawyering. This comparative approach serves to illustrate how the idiosyncratic organisational and procedural rules of EU law translate into opportunities and constrains for \u00c2\u00bflaw for social change\u00c2\u00bf endeavours. In parallel, the course aims to equip students with the theoretical and methodological toolbox of socio-legal research. Students will engage in discussions on the theory and practice of legal mobilisation in Europe and will analyse landmark examples in the area. Thanks to the involvement of two guest lecturers \u00c2\u00bf an academic expert and a legal practitioner \u00c2\u00bf students will be exposed to different approaches and address the topic from a theoretical, practical and comparative angle.",

    "summary": "This course explores the genesis and development of natural law theories, from Ancient Greece to the early modern period.  It will focus on the most primary sources on natural law, which would then form the basis for debate.",
    "course_description": "Description: Natural law is one of the most debated and controversial ideas of the entire Western legal culture. While one of the oldest legal concepts, it is also one of the most important in contemporary legal debates. The concepts of fundamental rights and, more recently, of human rights arguably stem from the notion of natural law. But what do we actually mean by natural law? The answer is surprisingly multifaceted, for natural law meant different things at different times. The best way to approach this subject, therefore, is a historical analysis of the most important jurists and thinkers who dealt with it, from ancient to modern times.From Ancient Greece and medieval Europe to modern times, this historical introduction to natural law will focus on the most important scholars who wrote (or taught) on the subject, to appreciate the diversity of their positions while contextualising their thought in the historical and intellectual context in which they lived.Course Outline: The course will start with what may be considered the birth of natural law, the conflict between written and eternal law in Sophocles masterpiece, Antigone. Then we shall focus on the thought of Aristotle, Plato and the Stoics, followed by the idea of natural law in Roman law. After that, we will move on to the early Christian concept of natural justice, for it is there (especially with St Augustine) that we shall find some of the clearest examples of the tension between voluntarism (natural law as the product of a superior will i.e. God) and intellectualism (natural law as the result of the intrinsic and objective goodness of a certain behaviour). Then, we will move on to the concept of natural law in canon law (i.e. the law of the Christian Church), and the crystallisation of ethical principles into legal rules which took place mostly with the Decretum of Gratian and the jurists commenting upon it.We will be then in a position to approach one of the greatest and most influential thinkers of all times Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas influence on the concept of natural law is still extremely important even today, after more than seven centuries! Indeed, it would make very little sense to discuss of natural law without some knowledge of Aquinas thought. In the late middle ages, natural law was put to a hard test with the discovery of the Americas: few, if any, of the rules that the Europeans took for granted (as fundamental, or natural) was followed by the inhabitants of Central and South America. Should those people be forced to follow them? We shall discuss this and other questions focusing especially on Vitoria and Suarez. In many ways, the second of the two represents the highest moment of Thomism and of the school of thought that took its name from it (the so-called Second Scholasticism).After Suarez, we will leave the South and move to Northern Europe, to look at the Reformation and its momentous consequences on the idea itself of natural law. We will thus explore how the thought of Martin Luther and John Calvin influenced the development of natural law in Reformed countries. This way, we will reach some of the most famous and influential jurists of the early modern period in northern Europe, such as Hugo Grotius, Samuel Pufendorf, and Christian Thomasius. Comparing them, we will realise the progressive (slow but clear) secularisation of natural law ideas. We will conclude the course analysing the political use of natural law concepts by some of the best known early modern thinkers, from Hobbes to Locke.",

    "summary": "Modern corporations draw funding to finance their investment needs from a variety of sources on the basis of extensive cost-benefit considerations. These include a multitude of factors, such as legal considerations, the quantity of funding required and cost of capital depending on its source, and impact on shareholders and management etc. Corporations may also obtain finance by either levering existing assets or resorting to unsecured bank lending or bonds. For the biggest corporations, the most important source of finance tends to be the capital markets. These normally comprise the debt and equity markets through which public companies can offer securities to investors or transfer the control of the company to new owners by way of a takeover or a private equity transaction. In addition, innovative and novel fundraising approaches and mechanisms, such as initial coin offerings, crowdfunding, and dual-class shares are rising, which bring both opportunities and challenges to capital markets as a whole and necessitate clarification and intervention from a legal and regulatory perspective.This course is strongly interdisciplinary and aims to develop a critical understanding of the subject matter through the combined study of the theory of finance in general, corporate and securities law, and the corporate finance and capital markets dynamics, in particular, with a special focus on the different stakeholders involved in corporate finance.",

    "summary": "This course deals with fundamental concepts of banking (and finance) law. Given the varied backgrounds of students on the LLM International Banking and Finance Programme - some have a legal background, whilst others have a finance/business/economics background - this course will seek to help students to undertake the International Banking and Finance Law Programme on an equal footing. This is because the topics studied in this course are fundamental ones regarding banking and finance law, and are relevant to other courses in the programme, i.e., the course looks at concepts that those dealing with banking (and finance) law need to know and understand.",
    "course_description": "As indicated above , Principles of Banking Law provides a knowledge of fundamental and important concepts relating to banking and finance law. This course is important not only as a matter of general knowledge for students involved in learning about banking and finance law, but for at least one other course on the programme (Principles of Financial Transactions). The proposed topics that the course will look at include:(i) the banker-customer relationship - the debtor-creditor relationship between a bank and its customer will be looked at - this is the fundamental relationship between a bank and its customer: that the customer only has a personal right to recover money deposited in a bank account; there will also be a very broad look at the United Kingdom regulatory position to give the discussion context;(ii) the operation of bank accounts - the application of moneys paid into, and out of, bank accounts, the rules relating to this, and the problems arising in relation to secured lending and debt recovery; in addition, the rules concerning set-off of bank accounts, particularly with regard to insolvency, will be looked at;(iii) banker's obligation of confidentiality - the duty to keep information acquired by a banker about a customer secret, subject to well-defined exceptions;(iv) anti-money laundering and data protection/cybersecurity (financial crime) - deals with the rules regarding liability for involvement with money laundering, including the obligation to report \"suspicious transactions\", \"tipping off\", the criminal sanctions imposed on bankers for non-compliance, and the effect on bank secrecy; also, the rules about safely processing and storing, and not disclosing, \"personal data\" of customers will be looked at, including the sanctions involved for breach, and the obligations put on banks;(v) bank conduct- the obligations and liability for advice given and services provided, under the general law and statute (the second Market in Financial Instruments Directive);(vi) trusts (relevant to banking) - money is often held on trust - this seminar provides a broad overview of what is involved in a trust and being a trustee, and the benefits of using a trust (such as, protection in insolvency)(vii) United Kingdom corporate insolvency regime (relevant to banking) - looks at liquidation, receivership and administration - banking transactions have to be predicated on the basis of insolvency: what happens if the customer becomes insolvent?; and(viii) secured lending (corporate loans and security for loans) - what are the key concepts involved in loan and security documents, and what are the key provisions in such documents.",

    "summary": "This course will look at the rules and practical aspects, as well as other relevant matters, relating to financial transactions, undertaken by banks/financial institutions. These transactions form a core part of a bank's/financial institution's activities, and are a major source of their profits.",
    "course_description": "This course will take a broad view of important financial transactions for banks/financial institutions, and matters that are relevant to them. These transactions or operations are important for students who wish to be involved in banking and finance as a lawyer, banker/financier or regulator, amongst other things, to have a knowledge and understanding of. The emphasis wll be on the rules and practical aspects of these transactions, as well as looking at matters related or connected to them. Whilst the base jurisdiction will be the United Kingdom (English law), given London is one of the two leading financial centres in the world, after New York, reference will be made to various pieces of important European Union legislation, and their effect, (eg, securitization, derivatives, and sustainable finance) as well as, to a lesser extent, the United States of America.The course will look at repurchase agreements (\"repos\"), and the role they play in terms of the private sector and providing short term secured finance, as well as their use by governments to control money supply. The course will also look at asset finance (finance leases (leasing of equipment), acquisition finance and project finance). In addition, the course will also examine (i) derivatives (which are a hedging mechanism, amongst other things), and (ii) international bonds (both corporate and international bonds, as well as Eurobonds - the latter are often issued out of London, where a bond is issued in a currency other than that of the issuer, eg, a European company issuing a bond in US dollars). We will also look at key provisions of such bonds, such as, collective action clauses (including the EU legislation on this), and pari passu clauses (including the Argentinian bond default and the litigation relation to it) .Related to this, in the context of international or sovereign bonds, there will be a seminar on sovereign debt recovery, as there is no formal process for putting countries into insolvency. Further, the financing mechanism, known as securitization, where debt is bundled up and sold to investors at a discount, will be considered - this form of financing was heavily linked with the global financial crisis in 2007/2008. The benefit of securitisation was it got assets \"off the books\" of banks and financial institutions, and gave them a large lump sum upfront. Hence, given the problems associated with securitization, the European Union and the USA have passed legislation requiring the seller of the bundled up debt (eg, housing mortgages) to retain a 5% stake in the asset that is sold to investors via a new company - this is called \"skin in the game\". The basic structure of a securitization, as well as the obligations imposed by the EU legislation will be looked at in some detail, and aspects of the USA position will also be considered. The role and function of credit rating agencies (\"CRAs\"), who were criticised for their role in the global financial crisis, will be examined in a separate seminar. There is EU legislation on CRAs (which has been transposed into the UK) imposing obligations on them; there is also Australian authority imposing liability on a CRA for negligence. Lastly, we will look at sustainable finance - a growing and increasingly important area of the law, which is very much customer driven.Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") matters are shaping banking and finance. It is an area in which the EU has made, and continues to make, a huge contribution. In this seminar, it is proposed we will look at Green Bonds, which are bonds used for \"green\" matters or \"purposes\"; these bonds were first issued by the World Bank, but the UK Government has also recently had a green bond issue. Corporations can also issue them. Up until recently, there was no legislation dealing with them - guidance was provided by the International Capital Markets Association with their \"Green Bond Principles\", which were a form of \"soft law\", and which were periodically updated. Very recently, the EU has passed legislation dealing with green bonds , we will look at this legislation, as well as the Green Bond Principles, and the underlying fundamentals regarding such bonds. The course, whilst focused primarily on private sector financial transactions, also looks at the public sector and international dimension involved with them.",

    "course_description": "1. The aim of this course is to provide students with the intellectual tools necessary to construct arguments based on civilian authority in a court of law. In doing so, the course will take a thoroughly practical approach, focusing across a number of seminars on specific instances in which arguments using civilian authority have been employed in a court of law as well as the opportunities and pitfalls associated with an approach of this kind. Students will be exposed to the sources associated with this type of argument, the intellectual merit of such arguments as well as their place within the larger narratives of the \"sources\" of a legal system. Finally, issues of accuracy and \"movable texts\" in historical sources will be addressed.2. This course will consist of an introduction followed by nine seminars focusing on specific court decisions in which civilian authority have been employed. Students will be asked to do reading in advance, to dissect the argument employed and to investigate the sources used in order to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the overall argument. This will be used as a backdrop for discussion of specific issues such as when an historical argument should be employed, how to do so, what sources to use and what pitfalls to avoid.3. Each seminar will be centred around a specific case. In each instance, a reading list will be provided. Students will be asked to analyse the arguments raised in each case, to assess the sources employed and to comment on the accuracy of the use of historical sources. This will be distilled into a position paper of 10 minutes that will be presented in class. At the start of each seminar, a student will be selected at random to present their position paper. Class members will be encourage to comment on the paper delivered, thereby providing a vehicle for seminar discussion.Please note that classes for this course will be jointly taught with Honours level students. Although students at both levels will study the same course materials, assessments will be graded according to the relevant benchmark appropriate to the level of study.",

The legal issues raised by autonomous agents that conclude contracts online on behalf of their owner will be discussed, as will be the regulatory issues of care/companion robots in a medical setting, self-driving cars and the automated city; and military applications such as drones. The course covers both embodied artificial intelligent systems (robots) and non-embodied devices (autonomous agents) Legal ramifications of these technologies are studied also with a view on their political, economic and ethical implications. Special attention will be given to efforts to create an international legal regime and associated proposals to standardise certain legal responses to robot technology globally.This is a rapidly moving field, and one aim is to equip students with the skills to follow the regulatory debate, evaluate proposals and decide if their home jurisdiction can benefit from developments elsewhere. It also gives them the skills necessary to work with computer scientists, to read technical literature to the extend that this is needed for a legal evaluation, and to ask them the right type of questions",

    "summary": "Global financial markets have gone through various stages of development since Bretton Woods. Crises, internationalisation, financialisation, technological advancement, and market and regulatory innovation have elevated financial markets to a position akin to being the heartbeat of the global economy. Especially, since 2008 the regulation of international finance has become the subject of extensive reform at the global, regional (EU), and national level.This course examines the workings of global finance and the institutional edifice supporting it, based on modern regulatory theory and practice, from an interdisciplinary perspective. This offers a holistic and in-depth overview of the economic, regulatory, and political framework under which financial markets operate internationally but also (supra-) nationally.",
    "course_description": "Therefore, in the first semester, the course touches on the role of global financial markets and the interplay between the different segments of global financial markets. To this effect, the course examines the evolution of financial law and regulation and respective theories influenced by several crises but, most importantly, the Global Financial Crisis. Emphasis is given to the study of national regulatory structures as well as of the international bodies that regulate global finance, eg the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). Moreover, the course will offer a critical analysis and insight of the main pillars of bank prudential regulation, including capital adequacy standards for banks and liquidity ratios. In that respect, the course will also have practical value for students who want to practise in the field of bank compliance and regulation.This overview of the regulation of international finance at the intersections of law, economics, and politics, achieved during the first part of the course, allows for a discussion of further contemporary developments and challenges in the field of international finance, such as digital currencies, platform finance and financial technology, in addition to the emergence of shadow banking, and an in-depth examination of specific regulatory reforms and structures of contemporary significance by focusing on specific jurisdictions, namely the EU, the US, and the UK.",

Under the heading of transnational crimes, topics can include responses to specific crimes such as human trafficking, international money laundering, piracy, terrorism and transnational organised crime, broadly defined. International crimes focus on acts criminalised by international agreement. Under both headings issues of processes of agreeing definitions, investigating, preventing and prosecuting will be examined. Specific sessions may change from year to year, and will be outlined in the course handout.The course is taught through seminars, with reading and focus set out in advance, and while led by a lecturer, there is an expectation that students use their engagement with material to advance their knowledge and thinking by engaging in collaborative discussions.",

In required (but unassessed) elements of the course, students will make connections across different disciplines and responses to different forms of crime.The field is characterised by often inconsistent approaches and students will be expected to deal with this, formulating a view on the coherence of the phenomenon of global crime and implications on how we respond to international and transnational forms of crime.Communication skillsStudents are expected to communicate appropriately with peers and experts, including practitioners, in seminars which are predominantly based around discussions and group tasks. High level communication skills are developed through the extended essay format.Autonomy, accountability and working with othersStudents develop autonomy through preparation for seminars and assessments where, beyond a core minimum, they are expected to direct their own reading, and define their approach to questions, selection of cases and examples.

Specifically, following detailed investigation of the concept of risk and regulatory theories and practices, the course explores regulatory frameworks in biomedicine (health research and medicinal products and devices), and how they interact with other regulatory frameworks (e.g. EU governance, public health, data protection), concluding with a session on alternative (non-risk-based) approaches to regulation. Students will then have an opportunity to present a topic in risk and regulation in the last three sessions of the course.The aims and objectives of the course are to:\u00c2\u00bb Consider the concept of 'risk' and how it features in modern discourses and regulatory actions;\u00c2\u00bb Consider the articulation and governance or management of risks across a number of human activities through specific case studies;\u00c2\u00bb Consider the different theories and practices of regulation;\u00c2\u00bb Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of various legal interventions at different levels of regulation;\u00c2\u00bb Explore and comment critically on how regulatory frameworks shape notions of risk in medicine and health research.",

    "summary": "The course introduces students to the legal and wider regulatory issues raised by the increasing use of automated and autonomous devices. As we increasingly allow machines to make decisions for us, this raises significant problems for our legal concepts of liability, responsibility legal personhood.In addition to gaining a deeper  understanding of the specific legal issues that are created by a number of particularly important applications of robotics and autonomous agent technology, students will also acquire a generic understanding of the types of  problems that are raised by autonomous technologies for the theory of regulation. They will gain  an understanding of the limits of regulation by law and the ability to evaluate comparatively other modes of regulation for a given problem.",
    "course_description": "Do we need law to prevent the 'robot uprising' beloved by SF writers? Since robots rely on sensors to perform their tasks, they also raise issues of data protection and privacy.  The legal issues raised by autonomous agents that conclude contracts online on behalf of their owner will be discussed, as will be the regulatory issues of   care/companion  robots in a medical setting,  self-driving cars and the automated city; and  military applications such as drones. The course covers both embodied artificial intelligent systems (robots) and non-embodied devices (autonomous agents) Legal ramifications of these technologies are studied also with a view on their  political, economic and ethical implications. Special attention will be given to efforts to create an international legal regime and associated proposals to standardise certain legal responses to robot technology globally.This is a rapidly moving field, and one aim is to equip students with the skills to follow the regulatory debate, evaluate proposals and decide if their home jurisdiction can benefit from developments elsewhere.  It also gives them the skills necessary to work with computer scientists, to read technical literature to the extend that this is needed for a legal evaluation, and to ask them the right type of questionsOutline contentThe course will cover amongst other topics:* The History of Robots and their Regulation* Science of Robotics: Basic concepts and ideas* Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for lawyers* Unembodied AI and private law: automated contract formation, online auctions and the question of legal personhood* Unembodied AI and criminal law: online surveillance and privacy in an age of robotics* Embodied AI: Driverless Cars* Embodied AI: Drones and other military applications: Robots in the law of armed conflicts* Embodied AI: Care robots and the elderly: medical law and ethics meets robotics* Robots and Creativity - the IP implications of robotics* What the future may bring: emergent themes in Robotics and the law",

There will be a particular focus on food supply chain sustainability, including measures to counteract power asymmetries in the wider context of food security, supply chain regulation and food & agricultural policies.",
    "course_description": "This course examines the legal organization of food supply chains, through the lens of commercial law and food policy in their local regional and global settings and impact on sustainability and food security.The course will consider food supply chains against the following context:With the world's population rising, the amount of food needed is increasing. Climate change is upsetting, if not destroying, established production patterns. Conflict, pandemics and animal diseases are disrupting or destroying established food sources and supply lines. The environmental impact of food supply and farming practices is clear and climate goals require change to minimize the harm caused by our current food system.Multinational companies have taken control over most of the food retail chain and food manufacturing. They purchase directly or through intermediaries from farmers and growers, sometimes viacomplex global value chains. These contractual relationships typically suffer from significant power asymmetry, most acutely but not exclusively in the context of small-scale suppliers.Policy responses to tackle food security and imbalanced power structures specific to food supply chains have not had sufficient impact. More needs to be done. There is a need to inform publicpolicy and emerging regulations to address the challenges in food supply chains and food systems.This course aims to engage student in the debate on policy and regulatory issues, to investigate solutions, assess the current framework and proposals for new measures. Where appropriate, the topics will be informed by a comparative analysis of relevant instruments applicable in the UK, the EU and worldwide.In addition to exploring the legal and policy frameworks of food supply chains, the course helps students acquire the skills and tools to assess and address issues of power asymmetry in commercialand supply chain contracting and measures to enhance sustainability of food supply.The course provides students with a critical perspective on the challenges and limitations of commercial contracting and instruments regulating unfair trading practices and sustainability goals and corporate sustainability initiatives.The course will employ a mixture of staff-led teaching and direct students to engage in their own student-led research projects. The course will culminate in a student conference, with individual presentations from all students on the course.The course will cover a selection of the following range of topics and issues, depending on availability of staff and student interest:- Commercial contracting and power imbalance in the food supply chain, systemic issues in supply chain contracting- 'Sustainability' contracting: product requirements, certification schemes, environmental clauses and enforceability- Approaches to addressing power asymmetry: Regulation of Unfair Trading Practices and Corporate Due Diligence- Food Supply Chains in light of UN Sustainable Development Goals, esp. No.2 Zero Hunger and No.12 Responsible Consumption and Production- Public Procurement of food and sustainability goals- Competition law and monopsony in the food system- Legal geography, policymaking and food value chains- Business and human rights framework relating to food- Food supply chains, food loss and food waste- Agriculture policies, food production and climate goals",

This helps to establish an understanding on these issues through different perspectives and lenses to ensure a comprehensive outlook on the field.Research and enquiryThe students will be able to conduct independent research into legal and policy questions relating to food supply chains through the study of key primary and secondary sources, and critically evaluating these sources.",

This will be combined with an in-depth analysis of real-life practical case studies drawn from current events which will help students to appreciate how the theory operates and is applied in practice.Students will begin by studying one of the most monumental changes to have shaped the investor landscape in recent years, the rise of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing. We will examine ESG metrics and the phenomenon of index investing and ESG index funds. Students will also learn about environmental and social shareholder activism initiated by non-governmental organisations, pension funds and activist hedge funds. We will discuss how these shareholders collaborate and interact with each other to effect change at some of the world's biggest companies. Students will also learn about the dominance of global asset managers and how these asset managers engage with companies on issues of sustainability.Within the companies themselves, we will discuss the role of the board of directors in sustainability, for example by examining law reforms on directors' duties to consider sustainability. We will also consider evolving approaches to executive remuneration to incorporate sustainability metrics.The course will not be limited to the study of public companies, as private companies also play a fundamental role in sustainability issues. Here, students will examine the role of private companies and the private equity industry in climate change and other environmental and social issues. We will also discuss venture capital, start-ups and impact investing.",

The course will cover the institutional framework, judicial system and some concrete case studies of areas of legal integration. It will also critically analyse the trade-offs and pre-requisites for states when engaging in such a process.",
    "course_description": "This course analyses EU law as a legal system designed to encourage and facilitate deep economic and social transnational interactions. The course is focused on the European Union but draws broader lessons on systems of regional integration. The course is divided into three parts and a conclusion. The first part addresses the constitutional framework for integration described by the Court of Justice as 'a structured network of principles, rules and mutually interdependent legal relations binding the European Union and its Member States reciprocally as well as binding its Member States to each other'. Part II will address courts as actors in the process of legal integration, presenting the EU judicial system as a network of national and supranational courts and also addressing the specific interpretative techniques (such as teleological interpretation, effectiveness and autonomous concepts) developed to promote legal integration. Finally, part III (the larger part of the course) will address specific legislative techniques of integration (harmonization, mutual recognition, agencies) generally and specifically with regard two case studies: the internal market and the area of freedom, security and justice. This will focus on the interaction of different techniques or forms of law (mutual recognition and harmonization). In conclusion, the course will consider the dynamic nature of legal integration ie that it is an ongoing process which generates its own pressures and momentum. It will also address the balance between unity and diversity within a system of legal integration and the extent to which the legal autonomy of states is balanced with the need for common legal structures.",

Defying assumptions and expectations that the Article 2 statements were intended to have rhetorical value only, hard legal effects have been drawn from this provision in recent years, especially in the case law of the European Court of Justice. Using Article 2 as the frame for the course, the seminars will consider:(1) The history of Union values: both generally and of Article 2 more specifically.(2) The legal content of recent developments: especially for the rule of law, solidarity, and democracy.(3) The legal implications of these developments: exploring questions about institutional balance; EU membership, withdrawal, and enlargement; the challenges of sustaining good governance during times of crisis and emergency; the relationship between legal and political evolution; and values that are not reflected in Article 2 TEU.",

We will consider a wide variety of hard regulatory questions posed by impacts of emerging information technologies. These systems are often changing, adapting, and shifting, meaning regulation in this domain does too. This creates a policy and legal landscape that is often in a state of flux but also gives us a wide range of case studies, examples, and legal frameworks to consider in this course.Each week we will explore and analyse interesting questions about the socio-technical risks and harms posed by specific new technologies, the merits and demerits of different regulatory strategies, and the role law plays in shaping how these technologies impact our everyday lives.The course engages with fundamental questions around how to regulate IT from ongoing debates over the past 25 years, since the inception of the field, through to cutting edge concerns.The course brings together perspectives from a wide variety of areas of law including intellectual property, privacy, and data protection. It also explores a variety of jurisdictions, particularly UK, EU, and international levels. The course also situates these legal debates in their wider social context by introducing students to socio-legal, technical, sociological, and design aspects of information technologies.We will cover cutting edge areas including online mediated work in the gig economy; governing machine learning and artificial intelligence systems; online platform liability and content moderation; data protection and privacy aspects of web and smart technologies such as smart homes; the role of cloud and edge computing; and strategies for addressing cybercrime + cybersecurity.",

We thus seek to provide clarification of the ways in which the theoretical resources of the social sciences can be brought to bear upon the phenomena of crime and criminality, their occurrence and distribution, and their contested character.This course is particularly suitable for students who are interested in learning more about the causes of crime and why societies (including the public, politicians and the media) respond to crime the way they do.Students from this course go on to a variety of different careers, including as lawyers (especially, but not exclusively, with a focus on crime and justice), police, criminal justice, the charitable/voluntary/welfare sector, criminology researchers and doctoral programmes in Criminology.",
    "course_description": "The course considers certain key dimensions within the field of criminology, broadly understood - the interpretation of action in context; the structuring of the field by inequalities and hierarchies of various kinds; issues of institutional continuity and change; and questions of cross-cultural and transnational variation, comparison and convergence. We then look at the application of these perspectives in, for example, understanding the place of crime in contemporary urban experience; at the representation of crime and justice in mass media and political culture; and at specific examples of current problems of security and social regulation. By the end of the course you should have gained a greater understanding of the historical and contemporary scope and aims of criminological theory and its relations with other species of social scientific thinking. Our primary objectives are to enable you to address theoretical claims in a critical and reflective manner and to deploy concepts in the development of your own research work.",

    "summary": "This course aims to provide students with an introduction to key positions and authors in the theory of international law. At the heart of the course is the question, what is the nature of the obligation created by international law and how do we understand its claim to authority? What are the foundations of the effectiveness - if any - of international law as a legal order? In attempting to answer these questions, we will examine works by, among others, Grotius, Vattel, Kelsen, Schmitt, Hart, Morgenthau, Koskenniemi and authors writing from within contemporary debates in international relations. Students doing the course will improve their literacy and their conceptual and analytical agility, and be encouraged to think about how these theoretical texts can (or cannot) shed light on specific problems in international law.",
    "course_description": "The identity and nature of international law, the foundations of its obligatory quality, and the conditions of its effectiveness and utility, are theoretical problems which lie close to the surface of the international legal order. These theoretical problems have remained relatively stable but the ways in which we articulate them and answer them have changed a great deal. At the heart of any theory of international law are the questions: what is a universal legal order, and how and why does it bind? Closely related to how we answer the first question is the second: what can we hope for from the international legal order and what can it achieve?The ways of answering these questions traverse political philosophy, theories of law and state, theories of individual and collective freedom, ideals of civilization, progress and empire, and theories of social scientific knowledge. In this course, we will engage deeply with some of the most influential attempts to answer this question, approach them in a diachronic manner from the late medieval through to the utterly contemporary. Students taking this course will read primary texts and in the process will learn both how to understand the argumentative architecture of these texts, and how to situate them within a wider political and social context. They will learn how to think with these arguments as well as against them, and be encouraged always to articulate their own assessment of the validity and value of the theoretical approach under consideration.The student learning experience will be interactive and dialogical, premised on thorough preparation for class by all participants. Through class participation, students will appreciate the complexity and insights to be gathered from the texts, and learn how to read them accurately and insightfully. In the process, they will be able to situate the texts and arguments within the arc of a theory of international law and the history of international order, and thereby be better placed to consider how these theoretical insights can be used to think through contemporary questions and problems. Students will be evaluated though assigned reaction papers, which will be presented in class, and also through a final paper, which will develop their analytical and writing skills.",

This will improve not only their knowledge of the field but also their agility in identifying arguments and kinds of theories, and in relating them and confronting these ideas with those from other theories in order to test their limits.Think critically:Besides understanding materials, students are trained to question received knowledge. This is based on the study of advanced commentaries and primary sources, and on the discussion with the colleagues and the lecturers.Form personal views and share them with an audience:The discussion format will support and train students to confront and exchange ideas.

These now extend beyond England to the major common law jurisdictions of the world, and the many 'offshore' trust jurisdictions of the Caribbean and the Channel Islands.",
    "course_description": "The course concentrates on selected topics in common law trusts, viewed from a larger comparative perspective.  The topics are chosen to illustrate distinctive features of trust administration in common law systems and to complement, in a specialised way, the LLM course on Comparative and International Trust Law. The course relies heavily on primary source material. Students taking the course would want to be confident about using the case law and statute law of the common law tradition.The course begins with the common law explanation for the divided trustee patrimony by the recognition of equitable property rights in the trust assets.  It considers the significance of recognising that beneficiaries' rights have both a personal and a proprietary dimension.  These are relevant to considering how trusts can be used to distribute the economic benefit of trust assets among beneficiaries and shield the trust assets from the claims of creditors.  This leads to a consideration of contractarian and property-based explanations of trusteeship, and the relationship between the default rules of the general law and express drafting in trust documents.The course considers how beneficiaries and protectors may control the way trustees exercise their powers, and the extent to which the settlors who create trusts may reserve powers of control over trustees once they have transferred assets to them. This leads to a consideration of shams and the other ways that creditors of trustees or beneficiaries may 'pierce the veil' of fiduciary ownership under trusts. The course ends with some of the distinctive claims that arise on the breach of a common law trust, including personal claims against third party accessories to a breach of trust and proprietary tracing claims for the recovery of trust assets.Provisional Teaching Programme:Week 1: Introduction and overview to trusts in common law systemsWeek 2: Equitable property under trusts.Week 3: Asset partitioning under trusts I.Week 4: Asset partitioning under trusts II.Week 5: Contractarianism and core duties I.Week 6: Contractarianism and core duties II.Week 7: General law limits on settlor control.Week 8: Shams, illusory trusts, and piercing the veil of fiduciary ownership.Weeks 9 & 10: Claims against third party accessories to a breach of trust.

Three seminars of the course will then be dedicated to the institutional structure and decision-making processes of the WTO, including its unique system for the resolution of international trade disputes. Subsequently, students will explore the key legal disciplines relating to international trade in goods and services, such as the core non-discrimination principles, market access disciplines and rules on dumping, subsidisation and product standards. Students will then engage with other substantive areas of WTO law, such as the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and the principle of special and differential treatment of developing countries. In addition, students will consider how WTO law interacts with other areas of international law and the extent to which WTO members can use trade measures to pursue other (non-trade) values, such as the protection of public health or the environment. Students will be further exposed to some of the contemporary challenges facing the WTO, including the impasse of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations and the proliferation of regional trade agreements, as well as to broader issues in global economic governance, such as inter-institutional cooperation and coherence, transparency and public participation.",

    "summary": "Developed in collaboration with the UN and based on the ten-year experience of the course convenor, this course aims to provide students with a basic \"toolbox\" of practical skills and strategies to deal with the challenges of working in conflict-affected environments.",
    "course_description": "This course is intended for students who contemplate a career in a variety of fields dealing with conflict-affected environments (i.e., UN agencies, humanitarian and development organisations, research institutions, etc.). Beyond strong theoretical knowledge, working in conflict requires a set of specific practical skills which few young professionals are equipped with. Developed in collaboration with the UN and based on the experience of several senior professionals, this course aims to remedy this gap by providing students with a basic \"toolbox\" of practical skills and strategies to deal with the challenges of violent environments. The course also speaks to the latest developments in conflict and peacemaking, such as the multiplication of non-state actors and the emergence of new technologies. It is centered around three core themes for effective and positive action: understand, cooperate, and protect. Students will benefit from an honest outlook on the daily challenges and mitigation strategies of working in conflict-ridden areas such as Columbia, Kenya, Syria and Ukraine. By the end of the course, they will be able to walk more confidently into the professional world and meaningfully contribute to the alleviation of the consequences of armed conflicts. While this is a legal course and is particularly well suited to students of humanitarian and human rights law, it will also be open to a small number of students of international development and politics.The course is composed of ten main lessons (excluding the reading week).Week 1: Leadership and Influencing Skills (Master Class)After an overview of the objectives, outcomes, and evaluation of the course, students will be introduced to a discussion around privileges, positionality, and self-assessment. This will be followed by a one-hour master class by a UN senior staff (i.e., Assistant Secretary General, Regional Humanitarian Coordinator), on leadership and influencing skills. Geographical focus: Africa and the Middle East*.Week 2: Protection and self-preservation strategiesBased on the \u00c2\u00bfhelp the helpers\u00c2\u00bf approach, this class will provide students with some practical tools of personal development practices and self-awareness, life skills, mental health, and human connection that support the restoration of the nervous system for professionals working in fragile contexts. The class will also include insights from IHL experts at OCHA who work for the protection of vulnerable populations in conflict-ridden areas. Geographical focus: Africa and the Middle East.Week 3: Problem-solving and creative thinkingThis class will challenge students to \u00c2\u00bfthink out of the box\u00c2\u00bf to provide innovative solutions to complex problems such as violations of human rights and forced displacement. This includes strategies based on art that focus on grassroots participation and complement traditional approaches to IHL and HRL. This will highlight the crosscutting nature of legal expertise that should infuse any initiative targeted at conflict-affected communities. Geographical focus: Latin America.Week 4: Assessment, monitoring and evaluationThis class will cover the whole process of monitoring, evaluation, and impact assessment, which is of increasing importance to practitioners, donors and grassroots communities. A particular focus will be brought to research and data analysis skills that are critical to students\u00c2\u00bf academic journey and future professional lives. This class will link to Week 3 by providing students with existing programmes developed around innovative approaches whose values have been harnessed as a powerful force for conflict prevention and peacebuilding. Geographical focus: Global.Week 5: Managing the distance: building bridges with conflict-affected communities (Master Class)How to protect human rights and improve the humanitarian situation of conflict-affected communities at a distance? This is the question this lesson will attempt to answer. After discussing the challenges of forced immobility and distance, students will be offered a Master Class by a UN senior staff (i.e.,\u00c2\u00bfUNDP Resident, Humanitarian Coordinator). The expert will highlight some practical skills and lessons learned from their experience coordinating humanitarian efforts to reach conflict-ridden areas. Geographical focus: Africa, Latin America, Middle East.Week 6: Adaptation in negotiation: speaking to the good \u00c2\u00bf and the bad guys (Master Class)Students will be offered a Master Class by a UN senior political advisor and/or a leading barrister specialising in international law, terrorism and human rights litigation. The expert(s) will build on their experience as international mediators in the wider Middle East to discuss the challenges and strategies of promoting the rule of law in cultural contexts where moral and legal norms are often different than in Europe. Geographical focus: Wider Middle East.Week 7: Research, policymaking, development: do I have to choose?This class will try to address a critical question for students of law: what is next and how to use the legal knowledge gained at the university? It will highlight the crosscutting and multidisciplinary nature of legal expertise by offering insights from professionals who work between multiple sectors related to conflict resolution and peacemaking. Geographical focus: Africa and the Middle East.Week 8: Fundraising and partnership with donorsThis class will shed light on crucial actors, without whom the humanitarian and development cycles would break, funders and donors. Indeed, before they can be part of any intervention, professionals working in conflict-affected areas will first need to secure the financial and political support of key individuals and institutions. This class will equip students with key advocacy and relational skills that will complement the leadership and influencing skills gained in Week 1. Geographical focus: Middle East.Week 9: Media in ConflictThis class will investigate the role played by media during conflicts, especially how different kinds of media influence the allocation of humanitarian aid. This class is particularly relevant given the record shortfall\u00c2\u00bffaced by the UN since 2021 between the funding required and the funding received. This also has key implications for the general public\u00c2\u00bfs perception of issues related to HRL and IHR. Students will benefit from insights from journalists covering armed conflicts and will be equipped with additional strategies for effective communication and data analysis. Geographical focus: Middle East and Europe.Week 10: New technologies and peacemaking (Master Class)Building on PeaceRep\u00c2\u00bfs leading expertise in \u00c2\u00bfPeaceTech\u00c2\u00bf, this master class will discuss the potential of new technologies to support legal thinking around issues of prosecution of war crimes, protection of human rights and improvement of the humanitarian situation of those affected by conflicts. It will feature several tools and visualisations created by PeaceRep, such as the PA-X Tracker and the PA-X Peace Agreements databases. Geographical focus: Ukraine.* Please note that case studies across the module might be subject to change depending on the availability of external experts.",
