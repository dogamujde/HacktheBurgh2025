It will demonstrate how the study of behaviour can be applied to animal welfare and how this application can be used to solve practical animal welfare problems. The development of UK/EU animal welfare legislation will be put in a global context and the application of ethics to animal welfare, as well as the trade-offs between economics, environmental sustainability and animal welfare will be discussed. Finally there will be a focus on emergent issues in animal welfare and the future for animal welfare science.",

Course 4 will review and integrate the material given in the previous three courses and will be assessed by a synoptic examination.Animal Body 1 and 2 will lay the groundwork for the study of systems biology and pathobiology in year 2. A major aim of AB3 and AB4 is to obtain an understanding of homeostasis and the pathologies that can give rise to failures in homeostasis. A strong understanding of normal anatomy, cell biology and physiology underpins the interpretation of the abnormal. We wish to emphasise a deductive approach Â¿ we will describe the normal workings of a homeostatic mechanism and guide the student to deduce what happens if a component of the homeostasis fails.Animal Body 4 will 'put the animal back together again'. It will illustrate and consolidate the teaching of the three previous modules using interpretation exercises. There will be little new taught material. The interpretation exercises in AB4 will take the form of clinical case studies.   They will emphasise how awareness of pathological change can illustrate and consolidate understanding of normal structure and function. In order to interpret the case studies the students will need to draw on their knowledge from all the preceding courses.",

This permits the interpretation of (as yet) unfamiliar problems that may be encountered in veterinary medicine and surgery, and as such will serve as a strong basis for the clinical years of the BVM&S programme.",
    "course_description": "1.\tSubject areasThe subject areas to be studied fall into two categories:a)\tProblem sets (6) - examining the responses of, and interactions between, different body systems to scenarios such as disease or altered environmental conditions.b)\tAnatomy component comparative large animal anatomyThe ethos of the course is that the material that has been taught in the previous Animal Body courses / modules will equip students for Animal Body 4, and any new information is provided only to aid interpretation and understanding.  Essentially, there is \"no new teaching\" within the problem sets  although some problems may require students to apply their prior knowledge in a \"new way\".  The specific problem sets included within the course will vary from year to year.2.\tDeductive reasoningFor each problem set, the principle will be the same.  Students are given information and asked to interpret it based on their knowledge. This should be a deductive process. For example, a good understanding of normal structure and function should allow deduction of the consequences of removal of a hormone (e.g. diabetes mellitus) or interpretation of special systemic adaptations (e.g. in diving mammals).  By applying this knowledge, it is consolidated and carried forward.Anatomy classes address various aspects of large animal (equine / ruminant) topographical and systems anatomy, and include short interpretative components based on clinical and management practices pertinent to these species.3.\tPrior knowledgeIt is likely that, in order to approach the problems and concepts discussed in AB4, students will need to reacquaint themselves with relevant areas of teaching from the previous AB courses / modules.  This should be done prior to formal classes (\"inverted teaching\" / \"flipped classroom\" model).4.\tIntegrationAfter breaking the animal down into systems in Animal Body 3, Animal Body 4 is 'putting the animal together again'. Systems interact, and disease and adaptation usually have multi-systemic consequences.5.\tClass formatProblem set classes are 3h long.  They comprise a 2-hour peer discussion period followed by a summing-up session.  During the former, students gather into small groups to consider the interpretation problems.  As discussed above, it is expected that each student has attempted these problems prior to the timetabled classes, such that the session allows each to evaluate the others' arguments, and a collective decision to be reached.  During the summing-up session, groups report their findings to the rest of the class.Anatomy classes include a greater taught / demonstrated component but also include some interpretative and practical activities.",

Two aspects of the emerging discipline of Equitation Science are crucial to the improvement of equine welfare. Firstly, the underpinning of both horse and human/rider training with learning theory and, secondly, the use of technology to provide objective data for traditionally subjective measures (eg. saddle pressures, rein tension/contact, stride length, weight distribution).

    "course_description": "The aim of this course is to foster a deeper understanding of contemporary research approaches, facilitate the student to be more effective at assessing and assimilating research data and encourage engagement in future research programmes.Through a series of recorded lectures, the linear narrative of this makes the argument that clinical research is critically important to enable the profession to advance the health and welfare of veterinary patients and proposes how this research approach can be practically achieved. The importance of clinical trials in both human and veterinary medicine is discussed before then reflecting on how we can better harness pre-existing knowledge to improve patient outcomes.The lectures encourage the student to reflect on how biases can influence clinical decision making to the potential detriment of patients. The value of long-term cohort studies is reviewed with the aim of fostering more widespread use of this experimental approach in the veterinary profession.Taking a Â¿One HealthÂ¿ approach, examples are presented that show how a deeper understanding of disease biology has the power to underpin therapeutic advances that can revolutionise health care.This five-week course is fully taught online through a mixture of recorded presentations, formative activities and asynchronous discussion. Live non-compulsory sessions may be scheduled depending on student group availability and time zones.As a guide, students will spend approximately 7 hours each week working through online material, including essential reading with up to 3 hours of online discussion and activity. A further 10 hours may be spent on additional self-study and assignments. It is very difficult to assess time spent in intellectual undertakings and the timings are only intended for guidance.",

A leaning towards ethics as they affect veterinary anaesthesia, peri-operative medicine and analgesia does not preclude the course relevance to other areas. Complex clinical ethical dilemmas, such as the over-treatment of companions animals, euthanasia and the use of client-owned animals for clinical research purposes will be covered.  The use of animals in biomedical research and publication ethics will also be featured.",
    "course_description": "Perceived advances in several veterinary specialities are increasing the gap between the application of these \"advances\" in animal patients and their approval by peers within the veterinary profession.  This situation is aggravated, at least in the UK, by the grey zone that exists  between the Veterinary Surgeon's Act and the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act.  In addition, there are increasing pressures for veterinary researchers to use client-owned animals in their projects. These challenges are creating increasing confusion and polarisation within the profession.The advances in veterinary medicine and surgery that have occurred over the last few decades have been made possible by parallel advances in veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.  However, ethical concerns have been identified with many of these so-called advances, often by veterinarians themselves.  This leads to moral conflict between those who do, and those who do not approve of these \"advances\".  Often these tensions re-ignite the \"captain of the ship\"  syndrome that affected the medical specialities, i.e., surgery and anaesthesia, in previous times.  Veterinary anaesthetists, having a tendency to prioritize concerns with the subjects of pain, analgesia and quality of life, are at risk of moral clashes with those with whom they work, but who have a different list of priorities.Increasingly, veterinary nurses and other forms of animal therapists are involved in animal patient management which sets up another potential strata for moral tensions when ethically challenging situations arise.The \"reproducibility\" crisis in science is in part the result of problems with the current way animal research is reported.  The course will also examine some of these concerns.This course intends to introduce the participant to general ethical principles applied to clinical situations.   It is hoped that the course will also provide insight into ethical dilemmas commonly found in modern veterinary practice to all professionals working with veterinary species.",

Concepts of One HealthÂ¿ will be introduced, reinforced and potentially further developed.  Group work will form a major part of this course.  Barriers to working with people from different disciplines, and innovative approaches to facilitating such work and to developing and building new communities to address health challenges, will be explored. By the end of the course, students will have developed a deeper awareness of the complexities of working across disciplines, and some related strategies to use in their own professional and practice environments.",
    "course_description": "The Innovative Approaches course has been designed to support participants from a broad range of natural and social science backgrounds to explore a variety of approaches to complex health challenges. Such challenges will increasingly confront health professionals with complexity and uncertainty, particularly when working at the intersections of human, other-than-human animal and environmental health.To work effectively on such complex challenges requires us to work collaboratively with others: other professionals, other disciplines and other stakeholders. There is thus an emphasis throughout this course on working in small groups, not just across disciplines, but also across difference and many other divisions and boundaries. This requires us to develop our listening skills in particular, as proficiency in listening is the bedrock upon which innovative, co-creative responses are founded.This course will be innovative, exploring the sources of creativity whilst emphasising experiential learning and reflexivity. As such, it will challenge you to deepen your awareness of yourself, of others, and of the complex health challenges you will be working on. It may therefore be challenging at times. However, by exploring all of this together, over the course, it is hoped that you will feel (and be) able to learn from each other and will find yourselves developing new creative approaches, rooted in receptivity and responsiveness. This is likely to support you in learning how to work more proficiently with your professional colleagues and other participating stakeholders.",

Finally, they will be expected to be able to draw from and bring together the experiences provided throughout the course for their group and reflective assignments.

    "course_description": "The objective of this course is to promote a scientific, evidence based approach to the management of sheep flocks and the diagnosis and treatment of the diseases of sheep, and to help candidates develop both practical and theoretical skills in the field.  The student will be able to evaluate their own standards of practice and develop strategies for continuous improvement in the future. Furthermore, they will understand the legislation relating to the health, management, and welfare of sheep and food production in the UK in the context of topics covered in the module.The principle of keeping sheep is to convert forage into a profitable meat product. The profitability of many sheep enterprises is dependent upon efficient production of healthy lambs. Poor nutrition, husbandry or ill health can result in significant deviation from the target growth rates and resultant economic losses can be significant. Additionally, replacement ewes need to achieve sufficient growth rates to start their reproductive lives healthy to achieve longevity within the flock. This course aims to promote development of a holistic approach to investigate ill thrift in lambs and thus improve lamb health and production in sheep enterprises.Five-week course fully taught online through a mixture of recorded presentations, formative activities and asynchronous discussion. Live non-compulsory sessions may be scheduled depending on student group availability and time zones.As a guide, students will spend approximately 7 hours each week working through online material, including essential reading with up to 3 hours of online discussion and activity. A further 10 hours may be spent on additional self-study and assignments. It is very difficult to assess time spent in intellectual undertakings and the timings are only intended for guidance.",

    "summary": "Science is often used to support decisions that have profound economic, social and environmental impacts.  Good decision-making follows from having clear preferences for what is to be achieved (policy aims) and using science to evaluate potential means of reaching those aims (policy instruments).  This \"policy-led\" decision-making is in contrast to often inefficient and ineffective \"data-led\" decision-making that attempts to infer the correct policy aims from scientific analysis.  In other words, when making decisions, science should follow policy, not vice versa.  This course will provide a practical guide to implementing policy-led science for decision-making, and will examine the benefits and potential drawbacks of following such an approach in the public, private and charitable sectors.  An emphasis on translating policy aims into tractable scientific questions is a particularly distinctive, and possibly unique, feature among the University's courses on science and policy.",
    "course_description": "The course compares two common concepts of the growth objective knowledge: empiricism and critical rationalism.  Empiricism lies behind attempts to reach objectively correct decisions through disinterested collection and analysis of data, whereas critical rationalism focuses on defining aims of decisions and testing hypotheses about how best to reach those aims.  The course explores the implications of these methods for optimising  scientific support for decision-making.A summary of the course is given below.-\tViews on how objective knowledge increases: an introduction to empiricism and critical rationalism and their application to decision-making-\tFormulating and testing hypotheses relevant to decision-making: translating policy aims into scientific hypotheses and efficient and effective ways to test those hypotheses-\tThe process of decision-making: defining and balancing opportunity and risk; communicating decisions; evaluating decisions-\tScientists' contributions to decision-making: the roles of scientific advisory committees and their members-\tRegulatory decision-making: why certain products or processes are regulated, the principles of good regulation and how science helps and often hinders regulatory decision-making-\tDecision-making in businesses: decision-making in business follows the same principles as regulatory decision-making, companies have policy aims, defending decisions and acknowledging products are not perfect without being defensive-\tMonitoring and evaluating decisions: no decision is perfect, risk management, testing that decisions are having the desired effect, general surveillance versus targeted monitoring-\tComplex models, big data and decision-making: complexity is not necessarily useful in decision-making, more data may make decisions more controversial, big data cannot discover the \"right decision\"-\tCase study (e.g. environmental risk assessment of GM crops in the EU) - use a historical example of scientific support for decision-making to synthesise the ideas from weeks 1-8-\tScience and decision-making in the media: take a current example of a controversial topic where science is being used to support decision-making; examine how the media and pressure groups portray the role of science; how do scientists react to this portrayal",

    "course_description": "This course will provide students with high-quality SCQF level 11 specialised skills in wound management and reconstructive surgery in dogs and cats.Wound Management focuses on managing wounds to the point where they are suitable for any method of wound closure. To illustrate this topic, the management of traumatic wounds is used from the initial presentation to the point of healthy granulation tissue formation and the start of epithelialisation. All the common groups of dressings and methods of debridement are discussed.Principles of Reconstructive Surgery covers the key themes in reconstructive surgery and how to apply them in practice.Advanced Reconstructive Techniques will focus on the application of free meshed skin grafts, simple flaps and axial pattern flaps in small animal practice.Five-week course fully taught online through a mixture of recorded presentations, formative activities and asynchronous discussion. Live non-compulsory sessions may be scheduled depending on student group availability and time zones.As a guide, students will spend approximately 7 hours each week working through online material, including essential reading with up to 3 hours of online discussion and activity. A further 10 hours may be spent on additional self-study and assignments. It is very difficult to assess time spent in intellectual undertakings and the timings are only intended for guidance.",

    "summary": "This course will introduce students to theories of innovation; how research becomes adopted in practice, in a range of different circumstances. The course challenges the linear model of innovation where basic research smoothly flows into applied research, then into development and finally into products that are adopted in the market place. The reality is usually much more complex.",
    "course_description": "It is observed that innovative ideas often fail to be adopted in practice. This course seeks to explore theories and perspectives on innovation and why this failure occurs. Using these theories and perspectives, students will achieve a deeper appreciation of the roles of multiple stakeholders in innovation, the value of different forms of knowledge, the importance of social networks in innovation and the way in which change has been achieved in socio-technical systems.Topics to be dealt with include behavioural change theories, farming cultures, Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation theory, Communities of Practice, the Farmer Field School model, Agricultural Innovation Systems and Multi-Level Perspectives.The course will provide basic training on qualitative research methods and the conduct of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research.",
