Students are asked to develop specific approaches to design problems in a coherent manner, deploying skills in architectural design and communication gained in earlier Stages. The course concentrates on developing architectural designs that integrate programmatic, formal, material, structural and budgetary considerations.",
    "course_description": "This course is taught through a number of parallel design Studios, focussed on distinctive sub-themes, which students elect to follow. Through a series of design exercises students are supported to research and investigate defined technological themes for architectural exploration, culminating in an architectural design proposal for a specified site and programme.",
